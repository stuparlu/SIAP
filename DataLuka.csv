When you find yourself in the woods, it’s raining and cold you're trying to start a fire. Your matches are wet, lighters are no where to be found kindling is wet. What do you do, freeze? No. You have a set of Survival Rings that you can wear every day. Without weight being added to your pack or matches to loose or get wet. You remove your rings use the course recessed section of the stainless steal ring to grate the magnesium ring into shavings then strike the included spark steel against the stainless steal ring, sparks fall on the magnesium shavings and poof, you have made fire using only what you have on your hands.

A set will include;

One stainless steel ring with a grinder stripe slightly recessed for comfort.
One magnesium ring with a cross hole to store the flint like rod. 
One rod made from a blend of metals formulated to produce a spark to ignite the magnesium.
We are currently producing prototypes and will update with pictures and a video as soon as possible.

Our goal is to acquire enough capital to start full production and launch a web site when everybody who wants this unique form a wearable survival gear can purchase them.

The Beard is a comedy based comic about an average guy that is suffering from male pattern baldness, and has nothing, suddenly gaining the power to morph his beard into any shape he needs it to be during an experiment to cure male pattern baldness. I wanted to create a story that would have everything I like to see in comics as a reader. I have the first few issues ready to print, so I'm trying to raise the money to cover the cost of printing them. Once printed I will contact comic shops to carry my comic, also i will get booths at conventions and festivals to sell my comic.

Risks and challenges
Once I get my comic printed I foresee the toughest obstacle will be getting my foot in the door to get it out and in the hands of comic readers, but i won't take no for an answer! I plan to get my comic into shops by building relationships with comic shop owners, and build relationships at comic conventions with other artist and writers to get the word out. I would also like to get into Diamond Comic Distributors to further my expansion in comic shops everywhere.

I'm Ilene Winn-Lederer and I'm excited to be here again at Kickstarter after last year's successful launch and funding of An Illumination Of Blessings, my first book project. If you are unaware of it, you can check out my campaign for that book here:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330347473/an-illumination-of-blessings/description  

Now, I'd like to share a new and very different book project with you! 

Notes From London, Above & Below is an unusual 42-page collection of annotated illustrations. These began in journals that I kept during my travels to visit family and friends in London between 2002 and 2009. 

Although I had to expand my skill sets as an illustrator to include writing and graphic design when I created An Illumination Of Blessings, the transition from quick sketches and notes in the London journals to finished illustrations in book form was still quite a challenge. 

Since many literal representations of Brits, buildings, bridges and double-decker buses by other artists & photographers exist, I knew that London, Above & Below would have to be different. So, as the subtitle, 'Above & Below' suggests, the sketches I chose to present and the annotations that accompany them are a synthesis of the factual and the fantastic. They are based on actual sightings and experiences filtered through my mind's eye which often sees beneath the reality most of us accept.

Though the video above presents a selection of finished illustrations with brief excerpts from their annotations, two of them appear below should you be unable to view them on your screen:

Mind The Gap
Mind The Gap
Mind The Gap was the first drawing that I completed. At the crowded tube stop near Portobello Market, I nearly tripped over a small yellow dog wearing a leather harness and a tidy checkered blanket. I began my apology to its elderly owner, but when she turned at the sound of my voice, I realized that she couldn't see me. Amidst my conflicting emotions, I suddenly envisioned these wondrous allies trading places as though they were denizens of an alternate universe in which believing is seeing…

Player
Player
‘Player’ is, for me, a quintessential denizen of the Shoreditch media world, an intense young man aware of trends before they take root and moving through life with an ever evolving philosophy of it. 

Notes From London, Above & Below is now ready for press and only requires your help with the expenses of high-quality printing, Library of Congress registration and the distribution of reward packages for your contributions.

These packages, offered according to the reward tiers listed on this Kickstarter page, will include signed books, specially designed postcards and high-quality gicleé prints from selected illustrations. If you contribute at the top tier, your name and personal inscription will appear on the book's dedication page.

When this campaign reaches its funding goal, you can expect to receive your reward package in early September, 2015.

Please understand that Kickstarter will not charge your credit cards for your contribution unless I meet my $3,000.00 funding goal.

Your help in spreading the word about Notes From London, Above & Below will not only work towards making it a reality, but will also be your passport to my imagination! I look forward to sharing this very special book with you. Thanks in advance for your support!

Risks and challenges
As a professional illustrator, writer and designer, I have always done my personal best to meet deadlines; this is essential to maintaining strong artist-client relationships. The only challenge that might impede my progress towards delivery of Notes From London, Above & Below to meet my early September, 2015 delivery date would be unforeseen life events such as illness on my part or that of a family member. Even so, if or when technical delays occur, I make it my business to keep my client(s) updated with all developments. And my book projects are no exception to this practice.

The origin of CMUK.
I'm Shaun, and at core, I’m a traveler. Whether far from home or in my own city of Chicago, I love to explore my surroundings. I’m often on the go, with a wide range of unique experiences from first thing in the morning straight through into the night.

For years, I’ve been looking for a shoe that would suit this lifestyle. One that could take me wherever my adventures do – from a trail in the rockies to a walk in the park, from a bike ride to a nice dinner, from the beach to a dance club or a bar. A shoe with the same sense of exploration that I have – that I could throw in my bag or suitcase and know I was good to go…

But this shoe didn’t exist. At least not with the versatility, style, and comfort that I needed.

I met Steve, the original designer of CMUK., on the beaches of Melbourne, Australia. He had an amazing idea and an early design for a sneaker that was lightweight and compact, stylish, comfortable, and even machine-washable. I immediately knew this had potential.

Together, Steve and I have worked long and hard to design a shoe that would deliver on four things: style, comfort, quality, and versatility. We set our eyes on a target lifestyle of the active traveler, evolving the shoe to give it a “traveler’s spirit”. We decided to maintain the low-profile outsole for style and versatility, while adapting the insole for comfort. With physician input, we designed the insole to provide metatarsal and arch support to stabilize the foot. Check out the functionality diagram below for more details. 

We hope you’ll find CMUKs as incredible as we do!

Introducing CMUK.
CMUK. is Anytime, Anywhere Footwear. It's the lifestyle sneaker that enables you to explore your hometown or the world without having to sacrifice style, ease, or comfort. CMUKs are lightweight, machine washable/quick dry, and available in a range of bold colors.

If you’re active, and looking to Take on Life Feet First, this is the sneaker that is your sidekick all day long.

(By the way, CMUK. is pronounced “smook” … it has an “s” like sneaker, and it rhymes with “look”.)

Why should you support this project? 
For those looking for a great pair of shoes, you’ll get early access to a unique and awesome product, at a terrific value.  

But we think many of you are here for more than that – and so are we. 

We are deeply committed to the long term success of this brand. We have been working on launching this product for nearly a year, thoroughly testing materials, insoles, and designs, and scrutinizing all aspects of the manufacturing process to ensure quality and safety. We've put samples in the hands of our advocates and skeptics, who have worn them for global travels, and for days, weeks, and even several months straight. Through this, an amazing piece of footwear has evolved.  

We have invested significant personal resources to get to this point and now hope you can help us by 'kickstarting' our first manufacturing run.

We see our backers as long term partners in the creation of our brand. This is a significant milestone in our progress, and we’re excited to have you be a part of it.

We promise to keep you updated on our progress, engage you as part of our community and keep you informed as the earliest backers of our brand.

Stretch Goals Added
We have created 3 stretch goals to take us to $30K, $40K, and $50K. For each stretch level we meet, we will launch an additional new color — selected by you, our backers. 

This means: 
If we hit $30K, you get to choose 1 new color for us to bring in with our next shipment.
If we hit $40K, you get to choose 2 new colors for us to bring in with our next shipment.
And, if we hit $50K, you get to choose 3 of our next colors.


Styles









CMUK. Features (why we love CMUKs)
Features:
Breathable, lightweight upper.
CMUK.-designed padded insole, providing metatarsal and arch support for stability and comfort.
Ultra-durable and low-profile rubber sole – dressy enough to wear into the night.
Barefoot ready.
Compact – folds flat for easy travel and storage.
Machine washable, quick dry.
Comes with 2 colors of braided “hiking” laces and a CMUK. drawstring bag.
Full size range for men and women.
Style range of 9 colorways (see above) – to suit your individualistic style.

Sizing and Fit:

US Women’s 5.5 - US Men’s 13.

CMUKs fit true to size.

CMUKs conform to your foot, so our sizes work well for all foot widths and lengths between US Women’s 5.5 and US Men’s 13.  If we reach our funding goal, backers selecting a shoe reward will be contacted for their preferred color and size.

Our Design Process
From the start, our approach has been about rapid prototyping and iteration — working with our manufacturing partner to create product samples and testing them with users to get to the perfect shoe.  Our manufacturer was also critical in helping us get to our initial design — a lightweight and versatile shoe with bold colors. 

While the general look of CMUK. hasn’t changed much, we’ve done a LOT of work to refine its structure and inner workings to improve the functionality of the shoe.

Among other improvements, we've refined our material selection to minimize scuffing and improve weight and breathability. We've overhauled the insole, midsole, and outsole for optimal stability and comfort, resulting in a shoe with a substantial and supportive insole despite the lightness and low profile of the shoe. And we've updated our colorways and explored new materials. We’ve come a long way…





Rewards
Thank you for your support! All shoe rewards include a CMUK. traveler's shoe box and drawstring logo bag. Backers selecting shoe or t-shirt rewards will be contacted once our campaign ends to select your desired colors and sizes. Unless otherwise specified in the reward description, all articles will ship for delivery in January.

If you'd like to order more than 3 pairs but fewer than 10, please back us at the $120 level and include an additional $40 for each additional pair.  Shipping is still free within the US, but please also add $10 per pair for shipping outside the US.  (For example: 4 pairs = $160 within US, $200 for international orders.)

If you elect the weekend in Chicago, we will contact you to plan your ideal Chicago experience sometime in 2014 that is convenient for you!



The CMUK. T-Shirt
Anvil sustainable organic cotton t-shirt in heather charcoal or purple. Available in Women's and Men's XS - XXL.

CMUK logo on the front. The back reads: ""Take on Life Feet First.""


The CMUK. shoe box
We are developing a ""traveler's"" shoe box with a handle for easy carriage. It is also designed to double for shipping, in order to minimize environmental impact and waste. It also looks cool:

Risks and challenges
CMUK. has spent a great deal of time preparing for every foreseeable challenge. This includes working with our manufacturer to develop and thoroughly test the product to ensure its quality and consistency, and with a range of operational partners to work through detailed logistics and order fulfillment.

Given our progress, we see only a few potential risks:

Order Delay: We have mitigated our risk of delay by keeping our manufacturer and other partners informed of our timeline, and we have been assured of readiness for our timing. We have also added an extra cushion to ensure timely fulfillment and delivery.

Color availability: If there is especially low demand for a particular colorway, we may not be able to offer it. This is due to the minimum order quantities set by our suppliers. In this case, Backers will be contacted to determine their second choice.

Sizing: CMUK. materials are flexible and conform to foot sizes, providing some flexibility for fit. We cannot guarantee that we'll be able to accommodate requests for size exchanges, but we'll do our best with the extra product we have on hand.

Hey All, 

Thankyou for taking time to read our story.

We are 3 siblings from QLD Australia who are currently in the process of creating our own clothing brand in the hopes of one day maybe opening our own clothing store.

Aaisha is 13YO and a budding Artist, she is very creative and loves Art,Music and Fashion (what teenager doesn't haha). Aaisha has been hard at work drawing designs to put on t-shirts for children, she wants to be able to dress her brother and sister up in her own designs. As Aaisha is keen to be an artist/designer when she's older this would be a great first stepping stone for her.

Yasmin is 8YO, as mischievous as she is, she is on the path to greatness, wanting to own her own shop selling clothes and shoes and wanting to be the ""boss"" haha. I think Yasmin will be a fresh face in the crowd, with a personality that outshines most 25yos haha she's  set to be greatness.

now we get to Mikey, his the one who started this all. Aaisha and I ( mum, Sara) were looking for clothes for Mikey and had a hard time finding what we wanted and go sick of seeing the same old stuff online that every store is selling, as we don't spend hundreds and thousands on clothes and items we like to buy items that are good quality and affordable, but all the ones we did find were to expensive or cheap but poor quality. 

So Aaisha asked me if she could do some designs to print on shirts for Mikey to wear, I agreed and she started drawing. We are big social media users and we noticed a lot of kids clothes are the same and we wanted to change it up.

So to start us off we need to raise funds to help set the kids up online selling their clothes, Aaisha the designer, Yasmin the manager and Mikey the model haha.

We would greatly appreciate any help we can get from anyone and would love to be able to start asap. 

Thanks again for your time and keep your eyes out for MikeyJ online :-) 

Risks and challenges
if we happen to not be able to succeed then at least we tried, we will fight and work our little butts off to achieve our goals. We are not quitters, we are strivers and strive to achieve our greatest.

I am raising this money ($3500.00) to have the musical charts/scores created for the top of the line musicians that will accompany me in the performances of this One Woman show with music. The phenomenal music arranger, Steven Kaminski is set to create the charts.

Securing the funds via kickstarter will allow me to get the charts completed and move forward into rehearsals. My intention is to have the show up and running this coming fall. The final destination for this show is an Off Broadway venue in New York.

ALICE in WONDERLAND in G Minor - Synopsis

Alice is spicy, intriguing and impulsive and she is on a continuous search for love. In Alice in Wonderland in G Minor, Alice takes you on a jazz infused, emotional roller coaster ride of an adventure through her wonderland of love. 

Risks and challenges
I have produced shows before and I know how delays and unexpected obstacles can and do pop up. As I have done in the past when that happens, I just regroup, stay the course and make necessary adjustments that will still allow me to reach the intended goal.

With the loving help of all you wonderful people of the internet I will hopefully start my long-awaited journey of creating a beer so fine, so pure, so tender that Thor himself would give up his hammer for a taste of this sparkling wonderland of a beverage. The brew will mostly be consumed by myself, but if successful the beer will be shared and enjoyed with friends, family and stangers. This is my calling, this is my quest, for alcohol sustainability.

Risks and challenges
There will be many challenges on my journey. finding the right spices, herbs and aromas are some of those. Furthermore, the search for proper tools and equipment will be a challenging task. These challenges will however be met with great confidence and a burning desire to never pay for beer again. I am cocksure that with the right support my dream will become a reality.

A huge Thank You! to everyone who funded ""The Book Zoo."" Your support is incredible!
""The Book Zoo"" is my first effort drawing a mini-comic or zine. During a creative slump, I decided to start on this project to prove to myself I'm capable of seeing something artistic to the end. While conversing with a friend, I made a joke about book petting zoos, and then I couldn't stop thinking about them. This project has taken me about a year to finish, as I got bogged down in life and let the books go untouched for long periods of time, but now all artwork is complete and it's itching to manifest in tangible glory.

A black & white print of each comic costs $1.40, as quoted by Gotham Press, a printer in Los Angeles which gives special rates to comic and zine makers. This adds up fast! I'd like to produce 1̶0̶0̶ 200 copies to fulfill the 60 requests from friends, 10 copies to Skylight Books (Los Angeles), 10 copies to the LA Zine Fest library, 5 copies to Quimby's (Chicago), 3 copies to Desert Island Comics (New York), and have some extras to re-stock consignment and give out to new people. Since my friends are scattered around the country and abroad, I am also looking to support the cost of stamps and mailing.

Shipping is included in the goal, so you will not be charged extra, even if you are international.

STRETCH GOALS:
ACHIEVED! AT $245 = 150 Copies: this will allow more opportunities to put the comic on consignment and hand out to new friends along the way.

ACHIEVED! AT $355 = Custom prints of the covers: I hand-drew covers to some of my favorite novels, but detail gets lost in the comic's 5x4 format. This funds the original 60 orders to friends and family I was trying to fulfill in my initial kickstarter run.

Backers will get to vote on which covers go to print!

New Backers: I've added a $15 reward tier where you will get 1 mini-comic and 1 print of your choice.

Existing Backers: If you've already donated $25+, please let me know if you would like a print included in your reward. Backers outside the 60 orders who have donated $10 or less, you can adjust your donation and claim the $15 reward if you would like a print. Unfortunately, I cannot update the text on reward tiers to explicitly promise a print.

ACHIEVED! AT $450 = 200 Copies: this will allow more opportunities to put the comic on consignment and hand out to new friends along the way.

ACHIEVED! AT $525 = Release party: whether I commandeer a DIY space or occupy someone's home, we're having a release party in Los Angeles with plenty of wine and endless rounds of telephone pictionary. All funds will go to drawing materials, wine/beer, and snacks.

ACHIEVED! AT $600 = 600 will continue to offset shipping fees, and will help pay for the art supplies and binding tools used in this project. 

NEXT GOAL = ∞
We've hit every goal! Amazing! All remaining funds will go to release party supplies and snacks, and recuperating the costs of art supplies used in this project.

For those curious - art was hand-drawn & then heavily revised utilizing photoshop and illustrator. My main tool is a Wacom Intuos tablet. Book Covers were drawn by hand and colored with Copic markers. They were cleaned up and lettered digitally.

Once these are printed in shipped, and I can firmly cry out, ""I did it!"" I would like to work on the next project I have in mind. It's about buff dinosaurs. Yes.

REWARDS:
Backers will vote on which book cover will join ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" as the print reward

$15 - A print of 1 of these 3 covers, voted on by backers
$15 - A print of 1 of these 3 covers, voted on by backers
One Hundred Years of Solitude:


Here are the rewards for $50 and $100 donations:

$50 / $100 - A drawing of Buff Dinosaurs, Wild Beasts, or Falconer Dogs
$50 / $100 - A drawing of Buff Dinosaurs, Wild Beasts, or Falconer Dogs
$100 Reward: A hand-drawn cover of your favorite novel, printed and framed. Plus all other rewards.

About Me
A writer and illustrator based in Los Angeles, CA, Renée coordinates an MFA at Art Center College of Design by day and dominates in her pinball league by night. She has produced and collaborated on a number of performance art and interactive installations and is looking to broaden her curatorial efforts. Renée likes literature, dogs, dark chocolate, gaudy prints, art + design, space, and afternoon naps. ""The Book Zoo"" is her first comic.

Thank you all for your support!

Risks and challenges
This is my first zine, so I've been experimenting a lot. After test printing a few copies, I finally got the layout worked out, but there can always be more issues along the way.

Putting my comics on consignment is not a sure bet, as there is a competitive review process at some of the local comic shops and bookstores. Copies will definitely be sent to Skylight Books in Los Feliz, Quimby's in Chicago, IL (my hometown!) and Desert Island Comics in Brooklyn, NY.

Maybe the comics will get creased and folded in the mail?!

Hi.

We are Matt Cavenaugh and Jenny Powers. Collectively, we're veterans of over 10 Broadway and off-Broadway shows. You might have seen Matt as Tony in the 2009 Broadway revival of ""West Side Story"" or Jenny as Rizzo in the 2007 Broadway revival of ""Grease!"" Or perhaps you saw one of us on stage in ""Grey Gardens,"" ""Little Women,"" ""Happiness,"" or ""Urban Cowboy."" Then again, you may have caught one of us on screen in ""Nurse Jackie,"" ""Mercy,"" ""One Life to Live,"" or the film, ""I Think I Love My Wife."" Oh, yeah. That reminds me. We're also married! See, the thing is, both of us have been blessed with a lot of success individually, but we have barely worked together. Well, we'd like to change that. So, we're making an album together!

The album will be filled with new and exciting versions of classic songs you already love! And maybe some new ones you don't know you love...yet! Songs recorded originally by artists such as...Etta James...Queen...Joni Mitchell...Frank Sinatra...and many others. We are also planning on recording a duet from the new musical, ""Dangerous Beauty."" Jenny will soon star in the world premiere production of ""Dangerous Beauty"" at the Pasadena Playhouse starting February 1, 2011. You'll be the first to hear a tune from this incredible new score!

We plan on heading into the studio very soon to start recording. With your support we hope to raise at least $10,000. Each and every dollar you pledge will go towards producing and releasing the album in February 2011.

From reading this, you've probably noticed that the album doesn't have a title yet. Join in, and this is just part of the inside scoop you'll get from supporting us. At the right of your screen you'll notice a slew of rewards we have lined up for you. Both of us will also be checking in regularly to keep you updated of our progress. So, please spread the word, and we thank you in advance for all your support!

For more information on Matt and Jenny, you can check us out on Facebook and Twitter (matt_cavenaugh & jennypowpow).

Hi there!
Wearing reflective gear saves lives. Show your child how these items work and learn through play with a hand-sewn pair of mascots which joins the magical love children have to hugs and affection along with a key factor of security. For example, during a walk with a pram the smaller teddy bear – ‘Superhero’ protects you through being able to be applied on the childs shoulders and put on a backpack with a Hi Vis reflective heart. This toy attached to the pram or backpack gives you visibility not only during the day but after dark or in fog. This toy educates the child about the topic of safety and it gives them a real protection on their way to school or elsewhere though the Hi Vis element in the bear. In my art studio I aim to focus on toys that not only entertain but also protect and educate.


Why am i offering two teddy bears?   

Simple! Even cuddly toys need company and friends!

Why is the smaller bear a superhero? The child always identifies with beloved mascots - seeing that size doesnt make a difference in determining super powers and strength, as well as not only just gaining more confidence but also allowing them to expand their imagination, teaches how to care for a friend; regardless of age or growth.  

 The Cuddly Teddy Bear
When we think back to our time during childhood, we recall that each of us had a favorite toy, superhero, blanket or a cuddly bear which we could not go without. Help me create toys with a passion and with the message of connecting with our wonderful memories of the past as well as the present now. The Cuddly Bear gives the child a sense of love and affection, each one uniquely hand-sewn. It gives the child company at home, in the course of play or sleep. The Cuddly Bear loves every child.

Mini Superhero Bear
The idea for a cuddly teddy bear and superhero bear was created during a conversation with my husband about the safety of children on their way to school or on a walk while playing in the park. Safety and love are the two most important words when we think about our children. I want to take this project up to a full-time task - desinging and creating these products and creating toys for children entirely sewn by hand, without any elements of danger such as buttons, zippers, etc. I want my stuffed bears not only to be the trustees of many childrens secrets but also to teach them some good habits at the same time as playing with and entertaining the child.

SOME REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD INVEST IN THIS IDEA

- These handmade soft toys are great friends to have and can be the trustees of children's secrets. It's these friends and bears that the little ones reveal all their secrets too as well as needing them to hold and hug in difficult times

- They give a sense of security and give the child the confidence they need to sleep by themselves in their own room 

- These cuddly toys are the bestest friends a child could want and it is they who understand the most and observe everything that happens

 - These bears are especially good as they teach empathy. They also can get hurt or damage their hand or even get an upset belly. The teddy bears as well as their carers may also get sick and have bad days.

 - Another positive element of these bears is that they teach children how to build relationships and communicate with others, as for young children this bear will be their accomplice in everyday tasks. This is because the children see’s the teddy bear as something their age which they can relate to and experience things with and this is very good for a child's relationships with other children. 

- The teddy bear can teach a child through their sewn-on applications of the reflective material and this causes the child to have the correct attitude when it comes to this topic of safety and this enables children to learn the need for reflective gear on the way to school, while walking or while playing in the park

DANGERS

In times like these of mass-produced toys made out of plastic, technology and innovation has caused the aspect of hand made and personalised items to become history. Our children are losing what is most precious in the first years of their lives. This is growing up in the company of a true friend and hero like their own special cuddly teddy bear.

Filmed entirely on location in the beautiful hills of central Vermont, this educational documentary series offers an opportunity to join students as they learn to become permaculture designers and practitioners during an applied Permaculture Design Course hosted by Whole Systems Design LLC. Condensing the contents of two separate 10-day courses, the Permaculture Skills film series is an invitation to share in the experience and learn from a combination of academic teaching, practical field work and hands-on workshops.


The Certified Permaculture Design Course (PDC) has become a standard in permaculture training across the world for those wishing to create resilient, productive systems for themselves or their clients. PDCs are typically taught over a period of several days and can represent an investment in time and money that many people aren't able to make. While this film series won't be a substitute for attending such a course in person (and won't provide any kind of certification) we believe it will introduce the viewers to many of the lessons taught in a PDC in a format accessible to anyone.

Course instructor Sean Dembrosky demonstrates how to find contour lines the old-school way with an A-frame.

The entire contents from 20 days of training will be edited into a series of video segments offered as a choice of 3-DVD set or online streaming. These will combine more formal academic lectures with field work and observation, as well as several practical workshops introducing the students to a multitude of hands-on, technical skills.

*** VERSION FRANÇAISE PLUS BAS ***

Like any other project, unexpected bumps on the road can cause additional delays, but we've allowed ourselves what we believe is ample time to deliver a quality product by the end of May 2015.

We've learned from our previous successful Kickstarter projects and we have a wealth of experience producing and delivering quality video products, so we're confident that this project will be no exception.

The money raised through this campaign will allow us to concentrate fully on this project for the coming months, and to sub-contract some of the technical aspects of the production (like audio mastering) to ensure we deliver a top-notch product within the established timeframe.

*** VERSION FRANÇAISE ***

Comme pour n'importe quel autre projet, les imprévus peuvent provoquer des délais, mais nous nous sommes alloués ce que nous croyons être amplement de temps pour vous livrer un produit de qualité vers la fin Mai 2015.

Nous avons grandement appris de nos précédentes campagnes Kickstarters et nous avons à présent un bagage d’expérience en production et livraison de produits vidéo de haute qualité. Nous sommes donc confiants que ce projet ne sera pas une exception.

L’argent récolté grâce à cette campagne de financement nous permettra de nous concentrer entièrement sur ce projet pour les prochains mois, et de confier certains aspects techniques de la production à des professionnels d’expérience (comme le mastering audio) pour nous assurer de pouvoir livrer un produit de haute qualité dans les délais prévus.

Sure, we all know who Major Gripes is today - pioneer, hero, teacher and leader of the infamous Rebel Army - but how did his unique story begin?

This comic book will allow his subjects hitherto unimagined access to His Royal Rudeness's private struggles on the rocky road to Rebellion.

Based on real life events (and not at all exagerated or anything) we give you a totally unbiased account of this god amongst men. 

Like the story of Moses, who led his people to the Promised Land, this is a story that simply must be told.

And that's where you come in...

Will a pledge of merely £3 or more you can ensure that this tome will be preserved for future generations and help inspire others to devote their lives to The Great Rebellion!

Hazaar!

Risks and challenges
There aren't really many problems we can foresee but this is our first Kickstarter project. We can only promise that should any issues arise with the printing or postage of the comics, none of it would come at a cost to any of our pledgers.

Risks and challenges
1. Campaigning a Kickstarter for a 2D animated short film is a lot more challenging than other projects since our end product is not tangible. Every single kickstarter reward, aside from the film, are made on top of filmmaking, we are putting special care and thought into the types of rewards we are offering to you.

2. Beyond artistic challenges, I personally am taking a risk by leaving my daytime job to make this little passion project work. It sure is frightening but also very exciting to step into a path of being an animation filmmaker. The minimum goal of this kickstarter is only going to animators, music, production, and kickstarter rewards. Within the reach of 50K, I do not get any profits from designs or storyboards that I’ve already completed. I truly appreciate your help to make this film real.
