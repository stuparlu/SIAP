    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe met in Tuscaloosa. We fell in love in Tuscaloosa. We fell in love with Tuscaloosa. That's why we're coming back to open Monarch. What makes a college town so incredibly captivating are the meaningful places you find yourself building friendships, figuring out life and figuring out yourself.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonarch is a craft coffee shop that celebrates the ordinary. Our place invites people as they are to delight in coffee as it should be . Monarch will be home to alternate brewing methods, thoughtful food pairings, speciality drinks, plenty of outlets, long tables, handmade countertops, one-of-a-kind mugs, comfortable seating, blissful aromas, carefully curated playlists, late nights, early mornings and your favorite cup of coffee.  Throughout this process, we've been reminded that it takes a village. We're humbled to see so many people's passions intersecting as Monarch becomes a reality. Our coffees + espressos are thoughtfully harvested across the world and roasted locally by Lyons in Florence, Alabama. Our mugs are handmade by a Southern artisan. Our logo was designed by a Birmingham native. We've put together a team of advisors to guide us through this journey. \nWe've taken coffee classes and sought mentorship from coffee shop owners so we can make your new favorite cup of coffee. We've brought together artists, friends and family. \nWe've saved every last dime. We're putting everything we have on the line. We believe in Monarch this much. And we're almost there. To raise the additional $50,000 we're inviting you on this journey.  If you want Monarch in Tuscaloosa, then help us make it happen. Every single contribution matters. And it puts us one step closer to opening the door.  What's the money being used for?  Our current funding supports our startup costs (business expenses, equipment, supplies, first few months of operations).  But it's time to make this place somewhere you would actually want to go. Contributions will be used to help cover buildout expenses.  Where's Monarch going to be? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a wonderfully charming brick building you may have casually walked past in downtown Tuscaloosa. It's unassuming and full of history. The building is located on 21st Avenue and is the previous veterinary clinic of Dr. Rufus O. Moore, Jr.  Dr. Moore served in WW2 and returned to Tuscaloosa to open his practice. He was renowned in the community for his wonderful spirit, grace and grit. The original building still remains and the Moore family continues to preserve it for a local business as meaningful as his. You helping us raise this money is the first step in making this building our home. It's in need of renovations and the capital will help cover these costs.  When's Monarch going to open?  Monarch will open in 2016. We're targeting an early fall open date. Join us  Monarch is refuge that doesn't yet exist in Tuscaloosa. We promise that our menu will make you more adventurous than you already are. We endeavor to craft the best cup of coffee you've ever had. We hope our space will make you feel comfortable, challenged and inspired all at the same time. We ask you to come as you are and enjoy coffee as it should be. What's in it for me? +Bringing to life a place that you can enjoy for years to come  +Supporting local business +Some killer rewards Pledge $10: Free cup of coffee once we open Pledge $25: Printed mug \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPledge $50: Coffee + chocolate pairing for you and your BAE/BFF.  Pledge $75: Handmade mug \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPledge $80: Two tickets to our opening party.

Our parabolic dish magnifies the sun to perfectly roast each bean. We are located in Santa Barbara California.  Try our solar roasted coffee today!  The Coffee   Our solar roasted coffee stands in a class of it's own due the the unique characteristics of roasting coffee with the sun at high temperatures. Our method of roasting uses all the visible spectrum and as much of the red and ultraviolet light that we can capture to penetrate the coffee bean creating a cleaner flavor. By using concentrated sunlight directly on the coffee bean, the bean is out gassing but the light beam will penetrate the coffee bean creating a flavor profile unlike anything you have ever tasted before!   :-) \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nFirst we put the green coffee beans in the solar roasting barrel then we focus the solar parabolic dish on the sun and wait for our Solar Coffee to roast!  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nOnce the coffee beans are solar roasted to the perfect blond, medium, medium dark or french roast we bring the dish down out of the focal point and take the roasting barrel off to cool down the beans.  To achieve the perfect flavor profile we take into account the color, crack, smoke, cook time, temperature and all the basics related to roasting a perfect coffee bean.  On top of that we factor in the days solar conditions including humidity, wind speed, wind direction, UV rating and we measure the suns watts per square meter.  Our solar roasting barrel is 65% pores allowing large amounts of concentrated sunlight directly onto the coffee bean.  All this allows us to create the perfect cleaner flavor coffee bean. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n  Removing the coffee beans from the dish and cooling them down. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur coffee for sale in our first corporate account at Santa Barbara City Collage, Santa Barbara California USA.

    "textDescription": "Story Welcome to Lisa Lim New CD Kickstarter Campaign!\n Hi I'm Lisa Lim! Welcome to my Kickstarter\ncampaign for my new and upcoming cd I've just finished production on. First, a\nhuge thanks and shout out to all of you that have continued attending my\nperformances over the years, staying in touch with me, keeping up to date on\nall the latest happenings in my life and for your constant belief and support\nin my music and art. It means more than you'll ever know and truly inspires me.\nAlso, I have to mention, sending out a huge debt of gratitude for everyone who\ncontinues to share my performance dates and music with their friends via social\nnetworks and by word of mouth. Your generosity truly touches me! I'm humbled\nand forever appreciative. MY NEW CD: I have some exciting news for you!\nRecently I finished the production end for my upcoming new cd. It's a very\nspecial recording to me and it is not your average run of the mill cd. It has\ntaken me a good portion of my life finally to get the time and chance to make\nthis very special recording. The production is nothing but top shelf and I owe\nmy gratitude to a very special producer from the UK who will always be dear to\nme for his time, efforts and friendship above all. The recording having been a\nsignificant project and effort has exhausted my resources though. Now, at the\nmost vital and important point, I want to share this with you and others, but I\nneed your help. This is where you can help make a difference. WHERE IT STARTED: A little history about this project,\nthe inspiration and where it began. My original project, Lisa Lim Band, has\nbeen performing for several years now. Performing at large and small venues,\nfestivals and special events. All the\nwhile, I've been juggling personal family affairs, while continuing to perform\nand be a working freelance musician. It's been a tightrope, balancing act to\nsay the least. I lost my mom to chronic illness about a year and a half ago and\nthen my paternal grandmother six months after. I was given the task and\nchallenge to be their primary care giver and I also had a very close and dear\nrelationship with each of them. With that though, it was a huge undertaking.\nFacts are, there are only so many hours in a day. Looking back on it, I\nhonestly don't know how I did everything I did, under the circumstances. After\nmy mother passed away, then, six months later, my grandmother passed away.\nEverything changed. A new chapter was beginning for me. I hadn't been able to\nrecord for the past 5 years due to, just not having enough time to commit to\nwriting and recording. Anyone who has done or been thru the recording process,\nknows it takes a lot of your time, energy and focus. I found myself having so\nmuch to write about, so much new music was playing in my mind all the time. I\nwas grieving, adjusting, dealing with enormous change and loss. So, I started\nwriting again and I kept writing. My keyboard player and producer of my new cd\nstarted having me meet at his studio once a week and present to him new\nmaterial. We'd make a demo of each new tune. We spent once a week, every week\nfor a few months doing this. And, sometimes, we'd squeeze in an extra day or\ntwo for this purpose during the week. Sometimes I'd enter the studio and my new\ntunes were embraced, then other times, I'd be told, shelf it and keep writing.\nSo, that's what I did. I wrote what seemed 24/7, between working, traveling and\ngetting up in the middle of the night from a dead sleep with ideas racing thru\nmy mind. There was no rhyme or reason how it came to me, other than from my\nheart and soul. Finally, my producer and I sat down and picked what we felt\nwere the strongest 12 songs I had to record for my next cd. And it started.\nLong days, driving, two to three times a week to the studio, that was an hour\nand a half plus away, one way, battling daily traffic, etc. We started the\nproduction end of the cd, by laying scratch vocal tracks as a guide, then spent\nseveral months recording. Many of D.C.'s finest musicians came in and\ncontributed in laying tracks. Scott Rabino, drums, Andreas Holmstrom, bass\nguitar, Thomas Johansen, keys, B Hammond and percussion, numerous vocalists\ncame in and laid angelic backup vocals, Mary Shaver, Tara Jacobs and Pauline\nAnson Dross. Then I spent weeks laying all the rhythm, lead, slide guitar\ntracks and then lead vocal and some harmony tracks. Some days it be fifty plus\ntakes for one lead vocal track. The one thing I can say about my producer, Thomas\nJohansen, there are no short cuts! He demands nothing but the best, 100% effort, in the studio! Thomas Johansen, is represented worldwide by Worlds End Management and has worked\nwith some of the best in the music industry. For example, this last year he produced The\nPaperboats, “Surviving The Flood”, which had a single, “Curses” which has spent\nmonths in No. 1 position on Portugal’s MTV. Another example, he’s worked with\nmembers of the legendary Mumsford and Son & The Killers on The Flowerpot\nSessions. This is just skimming the surface of his very impressive discography! Thomas managed to get me to tap into the\nemotion, where it was, that each song came from, deep within me. Each take, I'd\nget a little closer to what it was I was trying to convey and capture in the\nsong. I can honestly say it was grueling, but well worth the effort. But, after\nI got thru it and he got the take that he just knew was the one, it all seemed\nso worth it. I'd literally crawl into my house after the drive home from being\nin the studio all day and I knew that my producer would still be sitting at his\nmixing console, listening and critiquing the days work. These twelve songs,\nthis body of work, I am so proud of. I cannot wait to share it with all of you.\nThese songs capture and say so much about life. Not just my life, but so many\nfolks and the wide array of experiences that can and do occur. Economic\nstruggles that we all are feeling, politics, love, loss, relationships and\ntheir ups and downs, life's daily struggles, closure, release, energy and, yes,\nsex appeal, too!  My hope is that each song will take\nyou to a cool place, give you a few minutes of release and in some way, you\nwill find yourself relating to it from your own experiences and interpretation.\nThe music will cause you to respond by tapping your foot to the beat, you will\nwant to open up your sunroof, or put the car top down and cruise down the\nhighway with the stereo blasting! Even possibly dance, make you think about\nthat special someone, laugh, cry and just maybe, touch your soul. To me, that's\nsuccess as an artist. To have your music move someone, emotionally, get lost in\nit, if only for a brief moment. Well, how amazing is that! Writing these songs\nactually has been a healing process for me in some respects in dealing with the\ngrief that has inevitably followed in the loss of my beloved mother and\ngrandmother. A very positive way to heal\nand move forward with everything in my life. HOW YOU CAN HELP: Now, comes the next phase of making\nthis cd a reality. I desperately need additional funds to finish this cd. The\nfunds contributed to this campaign will enable me to get the tracks mastered,\nartwork and graphics done, cd pressed and assist with promo and distributional\nexpenses. Anything, everything you can contribute, will be forever appreciated\nand a part of something really special. And you will see, that pledges made,\nhave some cool perks that come along with it. Checkout the list! I assure you\nthe choices are tantalizing! Every dollar contributed, gets me one step closer\nto sharing this fresh new music with you! Risks and challenges Risks: Simple. If the campaign doesn't reach it's funding goal, you keep your money. There is not a set cd release date scheduled. But, as soon as that is confirmed, your items will ship out to you ASAP! Keep in mind, all of the recording, production end of this project has been completed. So, I’m very close to having completed product in hand to put in your hands! I will be continuing to keep you up to date on the progress and latest happenings with this project as the campaign progresses and upon successful completion, via email. \nThanks for keeping it real!

    "textDescription": "Story The origin of CMUK. \nI'm Shaun, and at core, I’m a traveler. Whether far from home or in my own city of Chicago, I love to explore my surroundings. I’m often on the go, with a wide range of unique experiences from first thing in the morning straight through into the night.\n \nFor years, I’ve been looking for a shoe that would suit this lifestyle. One that could take me wherever my adventures do – from a trail in the rockies to a walk in the park, from a bike ride to a nice dinner, from the beach to a dance club or a bar. A shoe with the same sense of exploration that I have – that I could throw in my bag or suitcase and know I was good to go…\n \nBut this shoe didn’t exist. At least not with the versatility, style, and comfort that I needed.\n \nI met Steve, the original designer of CMUK., on the beaches of Melbourne, Australia. He had an amazing idea and an early design for a sneaker that was lightweight and compact, stylish, comfortable, and even machine-washable. I immediately knew this had potential. \nTogether, Steve and I have worked long and hard to design a shoe that would deliver on four things: style, comfort, quality, and versatility. We set our eyes on a target lifestyle of the active traveler, evolving the shoe to give it a “traveler’s spirit”. We decided to maintain the low-profile outsole for style and versatility, while adapting the insole for comfort. With physician input, we designed the insole to provide metatarsal and arch support to stabilize the foot. Check out the functionality diagram below for more details.  \nWe hope you’ll find CMUKs as incredible as we do! \nIntroducing CMUK. \nCMUK. is Anytime, Anywhere Footwear. It's the lifestyle sneaker that enables you to explore your hometown or the world without having to sacrifice style, ease, or comfort. CMUKs are lightweight, machine washable/quick dry, and available in a range of bold colors. \nIf you’re active, and looking to Take on Life Feet First, this is the sneaker that is your sidekick all day long. \n(By the way, CMUK. is pronounced “smook” … it has an “s” like sneaker, and it rhymes with “look”.) \n\nWhy should you support this project?  \nFor those looking for a great pair of shoes, you’ll get early access to a unique and awesome product, at a terrific value.   \nBut we think many of you are here for more than that – and so are we.  \nWe are deeply committed to the long term success of this brand. We have been working on launching this product for nearly a year, thoroughly testing materials, insoles, and designs, and scrutinizing all aspects of the manufacturing process to ensure quality and safety. We've put samples in the hands of our advocates and skeptics, who have worn them for global travels, and for days, weeks, and even several months straight. Through this, an amazing piece of footwear has evolved.   \nWe have invested significant personal resources to get to this point and now hope you can help us by 'kickstarting' our first manufacturing run. \nWe see our backers as long term partners in the creation of our brand. This is a significant milestone in our progress, and we’re excited to have you be a part of it. \nWe promise to keep you updated on our progress, engage you as part of our community and keep you informed as the earliest backers of our brand. \nStretch Goals Added \nWe have created 3 stretch goals to take us to $30K, $40K, and $50K. \nFor each stretch level we meet, we will launch an additional new color — selected by you, our backers.  \n\nThis means:  \nIf we hit $30K, you get to choose 1 new color for us to bring in with our next shipment. \nIf we hit $40K, you get to choose 2 new colors for us to bring in with our next shipment. \nAnd, if we hit $50K, you get to choose 3 of our next colors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMUK. Features (why we love CMUKs) \n\nFeatures: \n \n\nBreathable, lightweight upper. \nCMUK.-designed padded insole, providing metatarsal and arch support for stability and comfort. \nUltra-durable and low-profile rubber sole – dressy enough to wear into the night. \nBarefoot ready. \nCompact – folds flat for easy travel and storage. \nMachine washable, quick dry. \nComes with 2 colors of braided “hiking” laces and a CMUK. drawstring bag. \nFull size range for men and women. \nStyle range of 9 colorways (see above) – to suit your individualistic style. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSizing and Fit: \nUS Women’s 5.5 - US Men’s 13. \nCMUKs fit true to size. \nCMUKs conform to your foot, so our sizes work well for all foot widths and lengths between US Women’s 5.5 and US Men’s 13.  If we reach our funding goal, backers selecting a shoe reward will be contacted for their preferred color and size. \nOur Design Process \n\nFrom the start, our approach has been about rapid prototyping and iteration — working with our manufacturing partner to create product samples and testing them with users to get to the perfect shoe.  Our manufacturer was also critical in helping us get to our initial design — a lightweight and versatile shoe with bold colors. \n \n\nWhile the general look of CMUK. hasn’t changed much, we’ve done a LOT of work to refine its structure and inner workings to improve the functionality of the shoe. \n\nAmong other improvements, we've refined our material selection to minimize scuffing and improve weight and breathability. We've overhauled the insole, midsole, and outsole for optimal stability and comfort, resulting in a shoe with a substantial and supportive insole despite the lightness and low profile of the shoe. And we've updated our colorways and explored new materials. We’ve come a long way…\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRewards \nThank you for your support! All shoe rewards include a CMUK. traveler's shoe box and drawstring logo bag. Backers selecting shoe or t-shirt rewards will be contacted once our campaign ends to select your desired colors and sizes. Unless otherwise specified in the reward description, all articles will ship for delivery in January. \nIf you'd like to order more than 3 pairs but fewer than 10, please back us at the $120 level and include an additional $40 for each additional pair.  Shipping is still free within the US, but please also add $10 per pair for shipping outside the US.  (For example: 4 pairs = $160 within US, $200 for international orders.) \nIf you elect the weekend in Chicago, we will contact you to plan your ideal Chicago experience sometime in 2014 that is convenient for you! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CMUK. T-Shirt \nAnvil sustainable organic cotton t-shirt in heather charcoal or purple. Available in Women's and Men's XS - XXL. \nCMUK logo on the front. The back reads: \"Take on Life Feet First.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CMUK. shoe box \nWe are developing a \"traveler's\" shoe box with a handle for easy carriage. It is also designed to double for shipping, in order to minimize environmental impact and waste. It also looks cool:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges CMUK. has spent a great deal of time preparing for every foreseeable challenge. This includes working with our manufacturer to develop and thoroughly test the product to ensure its quality and consistency, and with a range of operational partners to work through detailed logistics and order fulfillment.\n\nGiven our progress, we see only a few potential risks:\n\nOrder Delay: We have mitigated our risk of delay by keeping our manufacturer and other partners informed of our timeline, and we have been assured of readiness for our timing. We have also added an extra cushion to ensure timely fulfillment and delivery.\n\nColor availability: If there is especially low demand for a particular colorway, we may not be able to offer it. This is due to the minimum order quantities set by our suppliers. In this case, Backers will be contacted to determine their second choice.\n\nSizing: CMUK. materials are flexible and conform to foot sizes, providing some flexibility for fit. We cannot guarantee that we'll be able to accommodate requests for size exchanges, but we'll do our best with the extra product we have on hand.

    "textDescription": "Story A huge Thank You! to everyone who funded \"The Book Zoo.\" Your support is incredible! \"The Book Zoo\" is my first effort drawing a mini-comic or zine. During a creative slump, I decided to start on this project to prove to myself I'm capable of seeing something artistic to the end. While conversing with a friend, I made a joke about book petting zoos, and then I couldn't stop thinking about them. This project has taken me about a year to finish, as I got bogged down in life and let the books go untouched for long periods of time, but now all artwork is complete and it's itching to manifest in tangible glory. A black & white print of each comic costs $1.40 , as quoted by Gotham Press , a printer in Los Angeles which gives special rates to comic and zine makers. This adds up fast! I'd like to produce 1̶0̶0̶ 200 copies to fulfill the 60 requests from friends, 10 copies to Skylight Books (Los Angeles), 10 copies to the LA Zine Fest library, 5 copies to Quimby's (Chicago), 3 copies to Desert Island Comics (New York), and have some extras to re-stock consignment and give out to new people. Since my friends are scattered around the country and abroad, I am also looking to support the cost of stamps and mailing. Shipping is included in the goal, so you will not be charged extra, even if you are international. STRETCH GOALS: ACHIEVED! AT $245 = 150 Copies: this will allow more opportunities to put the comic on consignment and hand out to new friends along the way. ACHIEVED! AT $355  = Custom prints of the covers: I hand-drew covers to some of my favorite novels, but detail gets lost in the comic's 5x4 format. This funds the original 60 orders to friends and family I was trying to fulfill in my initial kickstarter run. Backers will get to vote on which covers go to print! New Backers : I've added a $15 reward tier where you will get 1 mini-comic and 1 print of your choice. Existing Backers : If you've already donated $25+, please let me know if you would like a print included in your reward. Backers outside the 60 orders who have donated $10 or less, you can adjust your donation and claim the $15 reward if you would like a print. Unfortunately, I cannot update the text on reward tiers to explicitly promise a print. ACHIEVED! AT $450  = 200 Copies: this will allow more opportunities to put the comic on consignment and hand out to new friends along the way. ACHIEVED! AT $525 = Release party: whether I commandeer a DIY space or occupy someone's home, we're having a release party in Los Angeles with plenty of wine and endless rounds of telephone pictionary. All funds will go to drawing materials, wine/beer, and snacks. \nACHIEVED! AT $600  = 600 will continue to offset shipping fees, and will help pay for the art supplies and binding tools used in this project.  NEXT GOAL = ∞ We've hit every goal! Amazing! All remaining funds will go to release party supplies and snacks, and recuperating the costs of art supplies used in this project. For those curious - art was hand-drawn & then heavily revised utilizing photoshop and illustrator. My main tool is a Wacom Intuos tablet. Book Covers were drawn by hand and colored with Copic markers. They were cleaned up and lettered digitally. Once these are printed in shipped, and I can firmly cry out, \"I did it!\" I would like to work on the next project I have in mind. It's about buff dinosaurs. Yes. REWARDS: Backers will vote on which book cover will join \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" as the print reward \n\n\n$15 - A print of 1 of these 3 covers, voted on by backers \n \n\n \n\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the rewards for $50 and $100 donations: \n\n\n$50 / $100 - A drawing of Buff Dinosaurs, Wild Beasts, or Falconer Dogs \n \n\n \n\n\n$100 Reward : A hand-drawn cover of your favorite novel, printed and framed. Plus all other rewards. \n\nAbout Me A writer and illustrator based in Los Angeles, CA, Renée coordinates an MFA at Art Center College of Design by day and dominates in her pinball league by night. She has produced and collaborated on a number of performance art and interactive installations and is looking to broaden her curatorial efforts. Renée likes literature, dogs, dark chocolate, gaudy prints, art + design, space, and afternoon naps. \"The Book Zoo\" is her first comic. Thank you all for your support! Risks and challenges This is my first zine, so I've been experimenting a lot. After test printing a few copies, I finally got the layout worked out, but there can always be more issues along the way.\n\nPutting my comics on consignment is not a sure bet, as there is a competitive review process at some of the local comic shops and bookstores. Copies will definitely be sent to Skylight Books in Los Feliz, Quimby's in Chicago, IL (my hometown!) and Desert Island Comics in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nMaybe the comics will get creased and folded in the mail?!

You might have seen Matt as Tony in the 2009 Broadway revival of \"West Side Story\" or Jenny as Rizzo in the 2007 Broadway revival of \"Grease!\" Or perhaps you saw one of us on stage in \"Grey Gardens,\" \"Little Women,\" \"Happiness,\" or \"Urban Cowboy.\" Then again, you may have caught one of us on screen in \"Nurse Jackie,\" \"Mercy,\" \"One Life to Live,\" or the film, \"I Think I Love My Wife.\" Oh, yeah. That reminds me. We're also married! See, the thing is, both of us have been blessed with a lot of success individually, but we have barely worked together. Well, we'd like to change that. So, we're making an album together! \nThe album will be filled with new and exciting versions of classic songs you already love! And maybe some new ones you don't know you love...yet! Songs recorded originally by artists such as...Etta James...Queen...Joni Mitchell...Frank Sinatra...and many others. We are also planning on recording a duet from the new musical, \"Dangerous Beauty.\" Jenny will soon star in the world premiere production of \"Dangerous Beauty\" at the Pasadena Playhouse starting February 1, 2011. You'll be the first to hear a tune from this incredible new score! \nWe plan on heading into the studio very soon to start recording. With your support we hope to raise at least $10,000. Each and every dollar you pledge will go towards producing and releasing the album in February 2011. \nFrom reading this, you've probably noticed that the album doesn't have a title yet. Join in, and this is just part of the inside scoop you'll get from supporting us. At the right of your screen you'll notice a slew of rewards we have lined up for you. Both of us will also be checking in regularly to keep you updated of our progress. So, please spread the word, and we thank you in advance for all your support! \nFor more information on Matt and Jenny, you can check us out on Facebook and Twitter (matt_cavenaugh & jennypowpow).

Condensing the contents of two separate 10-day courses, the Permaculture Skills film series is an invitation to share in the experience and learn from a combination of academic teaching, practical field work and hands-on workshops. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Certified Permaculture Design Course (PDC) has become a standard in permaculture training across the world for those wishing to create resilient, productive systems for themselves or their clients. PDCs are typically taught over a period of several days and can represent an investment in time and money that many people aren't able to make. While this film series won't be a substitute for attending such a course in person (and won't provide any kind of certification) we believe it will introduce the viewers to many of the lessons taught in a PDC in a format accessible to anyone. \n\n\nCourse instructor Sean Dembrosky demonstrates how to find contour lines the old-school way with an A-frame. \n \n\n \n\n\nThe entire contents from 20 days of training will be edited into a series of video segments offered as a choice of 3-DVD set  or online streaming .

Beyond artistic challenges, I personally am taking a risk by leaving my daytime job to make this little passion project work. It sure is frightening but also very exciting to step into a path of being an animation filmmaker. The minimum goal of this kickstarter is only going to animators, music, production, and kickstarter rewards. Within the reach of 50K, I do not get any profits from designs or storyboards that I’ve already completed. I truly appreciate your help to make this film real.

    "textDescription": "Story Why I Created the Feather Cast Furled Leader? Furled leaders are not new, however in Australia they are almost impossible to get and if you do get one in my experience they are substandard. They are made from inappropriate material with memory and untidy loops for attaching line and tippet.\n  As an experienced fly fisher, a constant tinkerer and a fly casting instructor, I am always looking for that extra bit of gear that can improve fly casting and presentation.  The tapered leaders currently on the market consists of mono leaders that have an inherent memory and will insist on coiling no matter how much you try to straighten them. Apart from the frustration of untangling, the coils take the energy out of your cast and so extra energy is needed for a good presentation. A Feather Cast Furled Leader has no memory, so all the energy of your cast is transferred through the leader to the fly. This lack of memory gives you an amazing turnover and a featherlight presentation.\n\n  I have been experimenting with tapers and material to find the best for any given situation. I wanted to keep it simple but with no compromise and found there was no one material and taper that performs well in all situations.\n  I have developed two fly fishing leaders with multiple configurations and a Tenkara line. The Dry/Nymph leader is a 5-step taper formula designed for the ultimate presentation and still providing great turnover. It is the best choice for dry fly presentation but also perfect for nymphs and wet flies.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thread construction gives the ultimate in presentation for both dry and wet flies. The light weight of thread also massively reduces drag. A small application of floatant (I recommend paste but any floatant will work) will keep your leader floating high in the water all day. Most people find a thread leader will last a season.\n\n  The Streamer/Salt leader is also a 5-step taper formula with a longer butt section designed to turn over larger flies. It is the ultimate leader for both fresh and salt water when throwing large flies in windy conditions\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Streamer/Salt leaders are constructed using nylon mono filament for extra durability. \n\n  All leaders are made with a loop on the butt end for easy loop to loop connection to the fly line. Leaders can be knotted to the fly line but tie your knot prior to cutting the loop off.\n\nThe tip of your leader also comes with a snub loop. The tippet can simply be tied onto the loop using the same knot as you use to tie on your fly or a loop to loop can also be used\n. The leaders are actually a butt section. I recommend adding a minimum of 2.5 or 3 feet of tippet but suggest trying 4 feet for extra stealth. Depending on your casting abilities a tippet of 7 feet or more can be used.    The Tenkara line is a 10.5 feet long, 5-step tapered line with a 3-feet optional loop to loop extension section. Again I created this line after being frustrated by others on the market. I have found this line to be a massive improvement on the non-tapered lines available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I need funding for. I have now been using these furled leaders for some time and in many fly fishing situations. I have also been giving them to experienced fly fishers to get feedback. I am confident that these leaders will improve your presentation and casting. I aim to make the Feather Cast Furled Leader available in fly fishing shops across Australia and the rest of the world via my website. To achieve production levels I will need to make another jig. I will also need funds for packaging and raw materials. I have had the labels designed using Fiverr but will need to make some minor changes before printing. If the funds allow I will place an ad in the Flyfisher . Currently I am making these leaders in the back of the shop I work at because the jig needs a high ceiling. If this project goes very well I will build a suitable shed to work in. \n\n\nPrototypeJig #1 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nA Feather Cast Dry/ Nymph furled Leader \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges The main hurdle to overcome is to educate fly fishers to the benefits of a furled leader. As a casting instructor I can easily demonstrate this and once you have cast with one it is clear how good they are. \nI will personally demonstrate the properties to new stockists so that I know they are fully behind and understand these new leaders.\n\nFurled leaders are time consuming to make and require practice and skill to do well, therefore it is unlikely the large companies will ever make them. I have made considerable changes to a standard jig and with two jigs in use I am confident I will be able to make them fast enough to provide a decent wage.

Even fewer have been invited to perform with that person on stage… How\nmany people do you know that have had the opportunity to work with their\nmusical idol? I might have that very chance! My life-long guitar hero and I,\nwith your help, will be able to collaborate on a no holds barred, star-studded,\ncareer launching type of project. \n\n\nEric Heatherly \n \n\n \n\nI met Eric Heatherly in the summer of 2000 in\nWinthrop, WA at the 2 Days in the Valley country music festival. At the time,\nhe was touring in support of his debut album, Swimming in Champagne, which produced a Number 1 smash hit CMT\nvideo “Flowers On the Wall.” Eric is one of the most complete artists on the\nplanet, with songwriting second to none, unparalleled guitarslinging which includes\nshades of Stevie Ray, Chet, and Brian Setzer and singing/showmanship nothing\nshort of world class. The impression left from that one meeting is\nimmeasurable, and it is safe to say that I would not be the musician I am today\nwithout it. This can be seen clearly by anyone who has ever caught The Chris\nEger Band live as my guitar playing, song writing, and overall style and stage\npresence have been affected greatly by his influence.

    "textDescription": "Story \"I've always been fascinated by the ability of sound to generate emotion and reveal what our hearts are longing to say.  Arrows and Sound starts with a noise.  A chord on the piano, the palm of a hand against the pavement of a garage floor in rhythmic motion, the strike of a mallet against a bell.  And from that sound, a melody is born, and soon a specific emotion emerges.  Like arrows targeted at the heart, the music i love and the music i want to make is centered around the ability of melodies and soundscapes to make us feel, to be inspired, to articulate the subtle groans of our hearts without saying a word.  For the past year, i've been so blessed to chase these concepts in the controlled and specific environment of the studio, and now i want to finish this record with vocals that will articulate what the music already is starting to say.  Arrows and Sound is my attempt to make music that moves me and hopefully others, to connect with hearts in a way that is unique to the power of targeted sound.\" -Philip Zach This kickstarter is dedicated to finishing the album and printing copies.  The money will go directly to necessary equipment to track the vocals, studio time, and the cost of duplicating the CD's.  The band is called Arrows and Sound and the album is the self-titled debut record. There was a time when Philip Zach thought he’d never sing again.   \n\nHe had spent a decade creating music with his brothers in Remedy Drive. He’d toured the world, won tens of thousands of fans, seen his dream come true and, in the process, built up thick lines of dull, white scars along his vocal chords.  \n\nSurgery was imperative. Full recovery was doubtful. His future, uncertain. The doctors told him that his only chance of ever singing again was to spend the 3 months following the surgery in total silence. No singing. No talking. No communication at all. It wasn’t a guarantee but, with absolute silence and a small miracle, he had a shot. For Philip, it was a shot worth taking.  \n\nHe resigned himself to total silence. He shut up entirely. He didn’t talk to his family. He didn’t catch up with his friends. He didn’t answer the phone, order at restaurants, or respond to friendly “hello’s” on the street. When his fiancé told him she loved him, he could only mouth the words in return. \n\nHe became an observer, a tagalong. He followed conversations instead of joining them. He listened to people and watched how they reacted to the things around them. He learned that being quiet was almost like being invisible. It gave him a chance to look at people, relationships, and the world in a new way.  \n\nAnd as he did, he started learning how to speak without saying anything.  \n\nMusic isn’t just what you sing. It’s a quality. It’s an intangible something that gets in your ear and pulls you, prompts you, spins you around and pins you down. It’s a movement and an impulse – a magic spell and a catapult. You have no more power over what it does to your heart than a kite has power over which way it blows. \n\nPhilip found that he didn’t need to sing to make music that moved people. Sounds are arrows enough. And it was out of this that a new album took shape.   \n\nEventually, Philip did speak again, and he can even sing again. But he learned something important in the silence. He sings on Arrows & Sound, but he doesn’t rely on himself. Instead, he trusts your own ears to do the heavy lifting.  \n\nAll he has to do is give you the sounds to point you in the right direction.   \n\nThose sounds, right now, are all dependent on getting enough money to actually record the music. Making Arrows & Sound  a reality won’t take much. There are even some special thank-you’s involved. How special? This special: Check out the rewards page and get familiar with what is being offered.  You could be a part of the record in very tangible ways. You could even have Philip come to your house to record part of it in your space.  You could end up with the bass that tracked most of the record.  You could even have Philip produce a song that YOU wrote and have it for your own use.  Make sure to check those things out. \n\nSo, give what you can. Or get a group of friends together and you can all give what you can. Take part in a special musical experience that, just a year ago, didn’t even seem possible. Philip spent enough time in silence to feel like he has something to say. The only question is, are you ready to listen? -Tyler Huckabee Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

However, as I discuss in the video and on this page, the estimated cost of the film in the end will be between $20,000 and $30,000. Any closer we can get to that goal will be of great help. \nZEN IN AMERICA: A documentary film about Zen Buddhism in North America is the first documentary series of its kind to thoroughly examine the history and practices of Zen in North America. The series will take us to Zen temples throughout North America to show how Zen Buddhism is being expressed in our modern culture – gathering intimate accounts and insights from the teachers, practitioners and scholars of the tradition today.  I began filming for the series in July of 2013. Over the next several years of my life, I will visit the many practice centers here in North America to document this diverse Buddhist tradition on film. It is my hope that you will be inspired to contribute to the documentary, help get the word out, and take some time to learn about the project today.  Connect with us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter   Subscribe to our YouTube channel   Visit the Zen in America website Watch the trailer for the film WHAT THIS FILM SERIES WILL EXPLORE From the mid-19th century on more Americans have been reading about the teachings of Zen, finding wisdom and insight in what it has to teach us and inspiring many to take up its practice. What started out as a tradition we had inherited from early Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese founders is today being carried forward by an ever growing number of Americans. From the more traditional practices to the more radically liberal in approach, Zen Buddhism is being simultaneously maintained and reshaped in the American grain.From the World Parliament of Religions to modern day, this important series will ask and endeavor to answer: How did Zen first arrive here? Who were its original pioneers? What are the various schools and lineages we see in North America today? What are the practices and ceremonies of Zen? How has the Zen landscape changed since those early years? What does a term like American Zen even mean? Does it exist and, if it does, what are some of its defining characteristics? What is the face of Zen Buddhism in North America today? What has been learned so far from this great experiment, from our many successes and failures?Above all else, this documentary series will strive to answer the most pressing question of all – \"What does this ancient, East Asian inheritance have to contribute to our modern American society?\" \nTHE STORY BEHIND THE FILM \"Zen in America\" tells the story of Zen Buddhism in North America through a patchwork of interviews with teachers of all North American Zen lines, recollections and experiences of practitioners, analysis by scholars and academics, archival footage and photographs, and footage shot on location. Over the coming years, director Adam Kō Shin Tebbe will travel throughout North America to talk to the leaders and practitioners of the tradition. Having only begun shooting for the film in July of 2013, the film already includes interviews with the following American Zen teachers:Sojun Mel Weitsman , Hozan Alan Senauke , James Myoun Ford , Myoan Grace Schireson , Myo Denis Lahey , Jay Rinsen Weik , Karen Do'on Weik , as well as many North American practitioners. WHAT IS NEEDED TO SUCCEED Making this documentary series will take me on an amazing journey for the next number of years. I need your help and support today to help me get out on the road to continue filming. Logistically, I have everything I need to make this film: camera gear, lighting, laptops and storage for the film. What I need your help with today is getting (and keeping me) out on the road for the coming years of my life to continue collecting footage and interviews with some of America's leading voices on the Zen tradition. I will use rental cars and grab flights to do most of the legwork, and will stay in the homes of others, sleep in my car, or stay over at Zen temples when at a new location. Except in the case of some kind of an emergency, I do not plan to use hotels or motels for lodging (though I may camp).I have set a minimum goal of $10,000 ,which will get me out there and on the road filming. This story cannot be told without overwhelming support from backers. Realistically, this film will require $20,000 to $30,000 in the end to get to the many practice locations scattered throughout North America.  How to help: By supporting our Kickstarter campaign for ZEN IN AMERICA, you can help us meet our outlined goals! Funds will be used for: \nRental cars \nFlights \nGas \nFood  \nEmergency lodging \nMiscellaneous equipment \n REWARDS MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE FILM AND RECEIVE REWARDS Choose what amount you want to give and what reward you would like to receive. When the funding campaign is over, you'll be contacted about your reward. REMEMBER, IF WE DON'T MEET OUR GOAL, WE DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING Kickstarter is all or nothing.

Deliberately austere, my compositions focus one’s attention to the detailed renderings of natural and man-made items that play out their balancing act on the painted stage. Wabi-sabi is a belief that all things living are imperfect, impermanent and incomplete. Things that are humble and modest are therefore beautiful in a small and quiet way.

    "descriptionMediaNumber": 4,
    "textLength": 3771,
    "textDescription": "Story \nHey everybody, I'm Scott Reynolds, and I wanna make a new record! \n I've spent the last twenty some years making records, and touring around with bands like ALL, Goodbye Harry, The Pavers, The Bonesaw Romance, The Steaming Beast, or just me and my guitar. The last record I put out was called Adventure Boy. It was produced by mega-genius Dave Fridmann (He's also produced bands like OK Go, Mogwai, Modest Mouse, Flaming Lips, Weezer, Thursday..... and he played in the band Mercury Rev. So I was honored to have him on board.) Plus, I enlisted the help of Flaming Lips' freakishly talented multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd, my buddies in The Pavers and Bonesaw Romance, and Colorado country killers Drag The River. I'm extremely proud of what we accomplished, but I still have a long way to go before I'm ready to say that I'm musically satisfied. And the pile of songs I've got right now, might be my favorite I've ever written. Check out this demo of one of my new tunes that will appear on this yet untitled mega-CD. I recorded it with help of my old pal Stephen Egerton from The Descendents/ALL: \nI'm asking for $15,000. I know that sounds like a lot of money (and it is) but it's actually the very minimum that I need to accomplish what I'm envisioning for myself. The recording itself is only a fraction of what I hope this Kickstarter campaign can help me do. I want to publicize this record the way no record label can right now. Label money is spread so thin in this current market, that there isn't a lot of extra cash lying around to help with publicity. So producing, say, a kickass interesting video (possibly the best way to gain a little notoriety these days) is just about impossible for a guy like me. I simply can't afford it. Also, I'd like to be able to get out and tour on a level that hasn't been possible in a lot of years, maybe even get a reasonable tour vehicle and/or some better equipment. Nothing will ever replace touring as the single most effective way to spread the word. But it can be a very expensive undertaking, especially if you haven't done it in a while. I'm dying to come to your town and play for you. So I'd love to be able to put some money toward making that happen. But mostly, I want to have the freedom to actually dig in and create my favorite record ever without fearing that my family will go bankrupt. The industry isn't like it used to be. People don't pay for their music anymore. So it takes some seriously creative thinking for ham and eggers like me to stay afloat, while creating quality records. That's why I'm so crazy about this Kickstarter idea. If you guys get on board with me, not only will you receive whatever rewards were promised to you. But I'll also promise you the best record I've ever recorded, and my undying gratitude forever. You'll have made a friend for life. And you can never have too many friends. Right? Anyway, Thanks for visiting my profile! .............. Scott  Oh yeah! Also, I'm also offering paintings in some of my rewards packages. My paintings are cool! I was originally going to be an artist (went to school and everything). So check 'em out below, because you might want me to paint one for you!  And if you can think of anything else you might want from me (that you don't see here), message me on my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/scott.reynolds.1650  Anything is negotiable! \n\n\n\"Gutted Usher\" A painting I did of the pop singer Usher for my daughter. Apparently he has a stunning colon. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nA painting I did in Le Puy, France \n \n\n \n\n\n\nA painting of a guy who's head was inspired by a guitar pick \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Thank you for all the love and support and for all those who helped spread the word. The Kickstarter campaign is over but there are still copies of the book available. Please contact me by email at adrain@adrainchesser.com for more information or visit my website www.adrainchesser.com there will be more information there in the coming weeks. THANK YOU, again for all the support!!! \n\n\nJP Hartsong / Stoneberger Creek, Nevada \n \n\n \nThe Project Since 2006 I have been working on a project titled “The Return”, it is a portrait of a people, a place and an ideal. The work is about a group of people who are living nomadically. They travel with the seasons on what was referred to by first nations people as the “hoop”. Their ideal is to live wild and free, untethered from society, to thrive by utilizing traditional hunter gatherer skills. Their greatest desire is to have a symbiotic relationship with the earth, “the Mother”. To live a life in balance, to give back more than they take. They are my friends, lovers, my extended family, we traveled throughout Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Northern California. We took refuge in old shacks, we dug roots planted hundreds of years ago by native american grandmothers, we gorged ourselves on the bounty of abandoned orchards.\n\n“The Return” is a collaboration with the Native American Ritualist Timothy White Eagle.\nOur collaborative process involved a considerable amount of prayer, consideration and discussion about the spiritual nature of the way in which these people live, the spiritual nature of the way Art works, and the ways in which archetypal energies work within mythic story telling.   \n\n\ncarrying water/Huddles Hole, Craters of the Moon Idaho \n \n\n \nTimothy White Eagle writes: “The subjects in “The Return” are predominately not Indigenous. Most carry European ancestry. And most come in one form or another from the disenfranchised margins of main stream America. Most are poor, some are queer, some are trans-gendered, some are hermits and some are politically radical. All believe that major shifts are needed in the way modern society interacts with the natural world. And all are willing pioneers, stepping off into uncertain terrain searching for something lost generations ago. Perhaps poetically, those attempting to live these ideals could be viewed as a rainbow tribe.  In their search they struggle to be released from old ways of being. Cars, soda pop, cell phones and cigarettes follow them. Convenience has a magnetic power.  Addictions, cravings, and desires are hard to break. These pioneer's seek a new way in the world, while still learning to let go of the old. These are uncommon Heroes shedding layer by layer the learned domestication of the dominator culture.” \n\n\nBurger King/Mesquite Nevada \n \n\n \n\n\n\nsage field/Lone Pine Ridge Idaho \n \n\n \n\n\n\nin the wikiup/Arco, Idaho \n \n\n \nBook Details Photographs: Adrain Chesser Text: Timothy White Eagle Edited by: Taj Forer and Michael Itkoff Design: Rory Sparks Size: 9\"X10.5\", hard cover, 114 pages, 49 color photographs, Retail Price: $50 Publication Date: March 2014 Special Edition Kickstarter Rewards designed and hand crafted by Rory Sparks at EM Space in Portland Oregon THE \"ARTIST EDITION\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n THE \"COLLECTORS EDITION\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals and BONUS reward WOW!!! We made it!!! Because of your overwhelming and humbling support, we will be able to see The Return as a published book this spring. We are filled with gratitude for all the amazing support and love that we have received for this project. We are looking forward to packing up your special copy of the book, and sending them out to you!\nQuite literally I have been overwhelmed with gratitude so Thank You Thank You Thank You.\n\nWhen we set our Kickstarter goal it was important that we set it at a level that we felt was possible to reach, as well as give us enough capital to help fund the book. Kickstarter campaigns are an all or nothing proposition, if we had not reached our goal we would have received nothing. So it was very important that we set a goal that we could reach and we have. Again Thank You! However the reality of our initial Kickstarter goal is that it is less than half of our actual cost to publish The Return. So since we still have a little over a week left in our campaign we are going to set a stretch goal of $20,000, which would help us cover most all of our remaining costs. To reach our stretch gaol would be a huge financial relief us so we want to show our appreciation.\n\nWe are adding a new BONUS reward, if we can reach our new goal. Everyone who has or will back our project at the $50 book level and up, will receive a signed limited edition 8x10 print of “cherries/Marble Mountain Wilderness, California” in addtion to the reward already offered. But this can only happen if we can reach $20,000 mark or above. You have all been so amazing and if you would please help us by continuing to spread the word, letting people know that they can pre-purchase their copy of The Return, we think we can get there. \n\n\ncherries/Marble Mountain Wilderness, California \n \n\n \n Adrain Chesser Adrain Chesser is a self taught photographer who refined his craft and practice through a personal mentor/protege relationship with the photographer Rosalind Solomon, and later with the photographer Debbie Fleming Caffery. His first critical success came with the body of work “I have something to tell you ” a personal exploration of what it meant to disclose life altering news. In 2004 he was granted a year long residency at the Santa Fe Art Institute. His work is part of the permanent collections of: Museum of Fine Arts Houston, Portland Museum of Art, and The Norton Museum of Art among others. He currently lives and works in the Pacific Northwest. Timothy White Eagle Timothy White Eagle is an Indigenous American of mixed ancestry. His mother was White Mountain Apache and his father was of unknown origin. He was adopted and raised in rural Washington state by working class white Mormon parents. He has a BFA from University of Utah. He spent many years working in amateur theater, cabaret, and improvisational performance art. For the past 20 years Timothy has been exploring and creating rituals. Studying with Indigenous American, Pagan and Haitian elders, he explored traditional forms of ceremony.  He helps lead rituals around the country in a wide variety of communities. In collaboration with visual and performance artists he co-creates works which contain the conveyance of Spirit. He dances at a unique cross roads between ritual and art. \n\n\n\n\n\nDaylight  is a non-profit organization founded by Michael Itkoff and Taj Forer and is dedicated to publishing art and photography books. By exploring the documentary mode along with the more conceptual concerns of fine-art, Daylight’s uniquely collectible publications  work to revitalize the relationship between art, photography, and the world-at-large.  \n\n\n\n\n\n Video shot and produced by: Mark Levine Music in the video by: Cadens Johnson \n\n\nsleep/east of Las Vegas, Nevada \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges The major risks and challenges involved in publishing a photobook include the possibility of delay. The project has been completed and we have the final design for the book, along with Daylight's 10 years of experience in producing finely crafted art books and contingent on the success of this fund raising campaign we will do everything possible to realize the March 2014 publishing date.

    "textDescription": "Story Since opening last April, Hot Chicken Takeover (HCT) has grown faster than we ever anticipated. We've met and served over 8,000 people so far and are excited to grow HCT into additional neighborhoods, businesses, AND days of the week. We believe the most efficient way to do this is with a mobile kitchen – allowing us to take the HCT experience anywhere our customers lead us. Back Story. In November last year, my\nwife and I took an adventure to Nashville, Tennessee. Among many things in that\ntown, we instantly fell in love with the tradition and community around hot chicken. The wheels started spinning\nimmediately. When we returned, we started\ntesting recipes and hosting hot chicken parties at our house. The chicken\nkept getting better and the group kept getting larger. And somehow – alongside\nhaving a new baby – we went from parties \nto concept dinners to pre-sale events at the Columbus Food Hub in April. Mission. Beyond great food, we're passionate about bringing together an eclectic and diverse community of customers. Our guests have come from every pocket of Central Ohio (and beyond) and are met with hospitality, not just from our team, but from one another. We're very excited to extend this HCT community even further. A mobile kitchen will make this happen. Additionally, our business exists to support a unique employment mission. We rely on strong partners like Community Properties of Ohio and The Columbus Urban League  to refer job candidates who are highly motivated to work but have barriers to successful employment - often ranging from less-than-marketable work histories to run-ins with the criminal justice system.  Once\nhired, employees receive significant support, coaching, and investment to support them as they move forward.  The addition of mobile selling should over double our current volume. This means up to a dozen new job opportunities at HCT - a big increase in sustainable impact through employment. These jobs would be in addition to the jobs already provided in our Olde Towne East location. And lastly, we make sure no food goes to waste. All inventory that remains at the end of our day heads to Faith Mission  shelters. \n\n\nHalf of the team! \n \n\n \n\n\nTrailer Design. After many, many conversations with industry leaders and mentors, we've opted for a trailer versus a food truck for our mobile kitchen. A trailer provides more versatility in design but also eliminates the risk of a failed engine or vehicle mechanicals (i.e. if our truck breaks down, we can always borrow or rent another tow vehicle ). We're currently finalizing plans for construction and anticipate a 10-12 week period for completion.The trailer has been designed to accommodate 4-6 kitchen staff stations and has sufficient capacity to serve 600 people in a 4hr time frame. The estimated budget, with equipment, is 50-70k. \n\n\nThe first draft - drawn two months ago! \n \n\n \n\n\nHave Trailer. Will Travel. Once complete, we'll immediately use the trailer for unique selling opportunities this winter (we're very close to talking publicly about these! ). Beyond that point, we intend on taking our restaurant on the road throughout both Franklin and Delaware counties. HCT will seek opportunities to serve new neighborhoods by setting up shop for 2-4 weeks, expanding the same set-up and dining experience customers have had in Olde Towne East. The trailer also provides the opportunity to serve special events and businesses. We've dabbled in this space on several occasions but have an inadequate set-up to do it profitably and reliably. We've begun discussions with several large corporate campuses - though they may change their minds when they learn about #HotChickenNaps (we'll file that under 'Risks and Challenges' ). Funding Goals. This Kickstarter is our first push for the big investment anticipated going forward. On top of the trailer, we hope to invest in an additional restaurant set-up (tables, benches, tents, etc ), reliable tow vehicle, and upgraded kitchen equipment. The funding goal of 40k is the minimum goal needed for us to move forward but the additional goals bring our anticipated investment closer to 80k. Gold-on-Black. We worked hard to imagine worthy rewards for your contributions. One of the coolest is this limited edition HOMAGE t-shirt.  \n\n\nLimited Edition HOMAGE for HCT: Gold on Black! \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges We believe in this plan. But we also have enough experience to know that even the best of plans can change. \n\nDuring this process of going mobile, we'll be managing a whole new slew of variables and challenges - everything from permits to managing our trailer builder to new equipment maintenance and more. These will definitely be growth opportunities for our leadership team and staff. And if our assumptions and plans have gaps, we could definitely incur delays in execution.\n\nAn additional risk is that we've underestimated the costs of this plan. We'll continue to rely on great mentors in the industry to check our assumptions and plans moving forward. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA hitman known only as The Snowman.  A call girl known only as Star.  Not their real names, obviously, but real names are a liability in the shadowy underworld these characters inhabit.   Star and the Snowman is the story of two people searching for \"normal\" in a world of death, betrayal, and revenge.  Snowman is a killer born into a family of violence; he knows no other way of life.  Star is a woman out of control in a whirlwind of drugs and sex, unable to focus a damaged mind long enough to find an exit.  When Snowman's latest job threatens to rip open some very old wounds for them both, they find themselves torn between the opportunity to escape this hellish life, and the need to finally learn the truth about a decades-old secret which began the whole nightmare.  But in their world, learning the truth always comes with a heavy price, and such debts can only be paid in blood...     On the surface, Star and the Snowman is a crime drama, but like the characters themselves, the film is determined to tear beneath that surface.  It's a tale not only of guns and gangsters, but also of the depths to which the human soul can fall, and of the courage and strength needed to climb into the light again.  The filmmakers' intent is to transcend the conventions of genre, creating a universally potent drama whose bedrock will be the authenticity of its lead characters: two people struggling against a cruel world, armed only with the same hopes and dreams all of us share.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe are Ohio-based filmmakers on a mission - a mission to produce world-class independent films in Ohio that can compete in the broader feature film market. Not an easy task. In the spring of 2012, we shot three scenes from the script as a proof-of-concept to illustrate director John Whitney’s vision for Star and the Snowman . \nThese sample scenes were produced with the help of a professional volunteer crew dedicated to the film's success. That's the key. The most critical element of our plan is to surround ourselves with seasoned professionals that love the process of filmmaking and believe in us and our vision of making quality films. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one thing that we\nare sure of is that as filmmakers, we enjoy compelling stories about\npeople who have been placed at a crossroads. In our past work, themes\nof loss and how people navigate life changes are what have driven us\ncreatively. Fictional stories with one foot in reality that immerse\naudiences in familiar worlds while asking questions, giving few\nanswers and having the filmgoer ask themselves, “What\nwould I do?” We\nfeel this is essential to telling original and compelling stories. \n \n\tBecause\nof the type of worlds in which our stories are set, we're able to use\nexisting locations to communicate the visual tone of our films. By\ndoing this, our brand of filmmaking remains cost-effective and\nefficient without compromising quality or production value. Our\napproach follows in the footsteps of successful independent films\nlike Sundance Grand Prize winning Winter’s\nBone   and Jeff\nNichols’ Take\nShelter , which was shot and produced here in Ohio.\nThese films were done with modest budgets. By\nbringing together a talented team and working from a great script,\nthey tell human stories that truly connect with the audience in a way\nthat has resulted in critical and commercial success. This mirrors\nour philosophy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause you want to see good movies made. Because you want to see THIS movie made. Because you're a good person. Because when this movie is completed, you can say, \"Oh, yeah. I helped make that happen.\" And because you're a good person. I know...we said that twice but it's true. Lets make this happen. What if I can’t pledge right now?   No problem! You can still help us by sharing this page with your friends, family, and colleagues and spreading the word about our film and campaign.  Tweet us, share us, like us on Facebook—every bit helps. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery dime of what we raise through Kickstarter will go toward the three parts that make up phase one of producing Star and the Snowman . \n\nPart One - Winter Scenes and 2nd Unit Exteriors \nThe stark, gray Ohio winter itself is like a character in Star and the Snowman , and is essential to the tone and setting of the film. The winter weather is something we can't recreate - we have to capture the film's establishing shots, exteriors and footage for the title sequence in Steubenville and Mingo Junction , Ohio before we move into spring .  At the same time, additional shooting of winter urban landscapes will take place in Columbus and Cleveland as well.  This is an important element in the film. The mood we establish in the opening of the film and the atmosphere we infuse throughout the film is PARAMOUNT...  so we feel that if we snooze, we lose on this.  \n\nPart Two - Casting \nCasting an independent film is a delicate process and critical to the \nfilm’s success. If we don't handle it properly, we will have failed as filmmakers. While the majority of the roles in the film will be cast with regional actors, we think it's important to cast familiar faces in key supporting roles to better position ourselves when we offer the film to distributors.  To do this, we will be working with a Los Angeles-based casting director. \n\nPart Three – Production \nWe need funding for continued preproduction and materials for phase two of production, principal photography and additional fundraising.  We all know that Kickstarter is a powerful crowd-funding tool, but we can't rely on it alone to make the film happen. Kickstarter will also help us reach out to well-heeled individuals to help with our future funding goals. We also need to produce additional materials that will help us with further development, sales and marketing of the film.  If you want to build a house, you must have the proper tools.  Exciting and eye-catching materials that speak to the potential investor and outline our plan are paramount to the film's success. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been working in production for over 20 years and have done everything from PA work to producing feature films.  And the takeaway from all of this experience is that we have the knowledge of what works and what doesn’t work in independent filmmaking.  We're in the process of building a strong creative team and crew made up of talented individuals who are dedicated to creating work of surpassing quality…and this is the start. John Whitney – the director Our director is award-winning filmmaker John Whitney.  John’s films have played in festivals across the country and garnered a number of awards. His films A Passion for Filmmaking and The Fixer have screened on the Independent Film Channel (IFC). Check out his latest film Eroded which has garnered many awards. Bill Farmer – the writer The script was written by two-time Nicholl Fellowship finalist William Farmer.  Bill is a seasoned Hollywood screenwriter who has optioned multiple scripts and most recently received story credit on the big budget film, Jonah Hex starring Josh Brolin.  We are extremely lucky to have Bill on board and feel that the script is fantastic. Kevin McClatchy – the lead Kevin has been cast in the lead role in the film.  He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and has appeared in feature films and television programs including Unstoppable , Love and Other Drugs , NCIS , The X-Files , and General Hospital .  Kevin is also an accomplished stage actor and recently appeared in the CATCO production of Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo . Phil Garrett – producer Phil has 20 feature films under his belt in positions ranging from his early\ndays as a production assistant to writing and producing. Phil's\nexperience includes studio features and independent films in live\naction, animation, and visual effects, and his body of work includes\nprojects at DreamWorks\nAnimation SKG,\nPDI, and Disney. Dino Tripodis – producer & playing the role of “Frank” in the film Dino started Never the Luck Productions five years ago and produced the festival award-winning feature film Minus One , the short films The Funnyman and Happy Endings . Dino also served as co-producer on John Whitney's and Phil Garrett's award-winning short film Eroded .  He currently serves as Executive Producer of Nite Owl Theatre, an online series now in its second season. Gil Whitney – the cinematographer Gil brings his talents and unique visual style to this film. He has worked on many independent short films and features and recently the documentary feature Meet the Phantods . Gil is also known for his award-winning cinematography on the short films Measured Sacrifice and The Fixer,  which was broadcast on the Independent Film Channel. Michelle Messenger Garrett – publicist/PR coordinator Michelle is a public relations consultant and award-winning writer with more than 20 years of experience executing successful PR strategies for companies ranging in size from small and startup businesses to enterprises such as Adobe and HP. Her background includes working with clients in the entertainment industry and with Cinequest, the San Jose Film Festival. \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges There are always risks in filmmaking, especially at the independent level. With as much planning that goes into any feature film, unforeseen circumstances can cause a number of challenges: the schedule may need to be revised, location issues can arise, and weather can be your friend or most despised enemy. Unlike a studio film where money can be thrown at any problem as a solution, as independent filmmakers we have learned to be resourceful and flexible, allowing us to overcome any obstacles. We have exceptional talents at the helm of every department of the production, and they're ready to take on this challenge and be a part of something special.\n\t\nA risk relative to the ultimate success of the Star and the Snowman is completing post-production by summer of 2013 in order to take the film to the American Film Market and other outlets in the fall. Producer reps (sales agents) want to have a finished film in hand. Gone are the days of showing a trailer, movie poster, or a work-in-progress to sell an independent film domestically and internationally. The main hurdle to completing the film production and post-production is quite simply, funding. With the proper funding, we can ensure deadlines will be met and deliverables will be completed on time.\n\t\nWe have a fantastic script. We have the drive and the desire to make this our best film yet. (Until of course we make the next one after this.) And most of all, we have a project that we know people will want to see and in turn tell others to see it. We believe in this film. We want you to believe in this film and especially us. The challenge? Making it happen. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

After the death of her dog rattles her routine, she decides to start dating again, and falls into relationships with two very different men -- the senior, exuberant Bill, who embraces life in the moment, and her younger pool cleaner, Lloyd (Martin Starr ), who is struggling to find his purpose, much like Carol. Through these new relationships, Carol confronts her fears about love, family, aging, and death and is forced to adopt a new outlook as she comes to terms with this new phase of her life. I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS is a deceptively small story, but it asks big questions. The setting, characters, and honest, human approach make this a surprising and unique film.

The funds raised on Kickstarter will complete our production financing, allowing us to begin shooting in March 2014. The team behind I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS has made feature films with budgets ranging as low as $6,000 and as high as $2,000,000. We're confident that this will be a film with creative integrity and high production value, and have taken the steps necessary to ensure that happens.  The film will be shot entirely in Los Angeles over 18 days to take advantage of top tier cast and crew without incurring the expense of travel. Many of the crew participating in the project will be alumni and fellow classmates of Brett Haley and Rebecca Green, who attended the University of the North Carolina School of the Arts, one of the premiere film schools in the country. These friends are highly skilled and willing to share their talents because of their dedication to the filmmakers and belief in the project. BRETT HALEY (Co-Writer/Director) Brett Haley grew up in Key West and Pensacola, Florida and graduated with a B.F.A. in Film Directing from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in 2005. Brett co-wrote, edited and directed the indie feature film THE NEW YEAR , which screened in over 20 film festivals, including the Los Angeles Film Festival. It won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival and was a Critic’s Pick in The Village Voice and LA Weekly . The film is 100% 'fresh' on www.RottenTomatoes.com . The New York Times said of the film, \"Out of raw materials, convincing 20-something dialogue, deft montages of night life, bowling, parties, the beachside setting - the director-screenwriter Brett Haley has built an encouraging feature film debut.\" It was theatrically released in NY, LA and Florida before finding digital distribution. REBECCA GREEN (Producer) Rebecca Green is currently in post-production on the feature film IT FOLLOWS, written and directed by David Robert Mitchell, whose debut feature, THE MYTH OF THE AMERICAN SLEEPOVER, premiered at SXSW and went on to screen at the Cannes Film Festival.

    "textDescription": "Story This\nsummer, I will travel with Xin Maya Wang, a middle school teacher of\nMandarin language in New York City, to document her return to China,\nwhere she was born and grew up.  Maya has received a grant to\ntravel for three weeks in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous\nPrefecture in the southeast part of Guizhou.  During this time\nshe and I plan to visit one to two villages per day to interview and\nvideo-document various artisans of the Miao tribe. The material we\ngenerate on this trip will then be used as a tool to teach middle\nschool students to speak and grasp more deeply the Mandarin language\nand culture. Specifics: \n\nXin\nMaya Wang, a native of Yingkou in northeastern China, is currently a\nmiddle school Mandarin Teacher at the Calhoun School in New York\nCity. \n\nMaya's\nobjective: \n\n -\n To support the students’ exploration of Chinese history and\nculture in the modern context by demonstrating through media the\nartists’ (writers, poets, calligraphers, “street-level”\ncraftsmen, modern artists, etc.) experience as they embrace the\ntraditions of the past in the face of a globalizing world. \n -\n To provide teaching materials and media assets that will support\nCalhoun teachers across disciplines (language, history, art, culture)\nin gaining a more in-depth understanding of the interconnection\nbetween traditional and modern Chinese art forms, peoples, historical\nperiods and cultures. This will also facilitate continuous\ndevelopment of a library of media assets that can be used by multiple\ndisciplines at Calhoun well into the future. \n -\n To offer students the opportunity to cultivate a unique, more\nnuanced experience and understanding of China from a US-based\nclassroom. \n\nMy\nobjective: \n -\n To capture the visual beauty and reality of the Miao people and\ntheir strong tradition of silver jewelery-making and embroidery. \n -\n To document the ways in which Maya uses her knowledge of two\ndifferent cultures to educate and inspire. \n -\n To create a visual portrait of Maya who grew up in a small village\nin northern China and now teaches in New York City; the physical,\nsocial, and economic juxtapositions between the two, contrasting\nworlds she has inhabited have contributed to a distinct way of being\nthat is at once compassionate, aware, and motivated. \n\nWith\nthe images from this trip, I will create a photography book, which\nwill record a young woman educating others by honoring her culture. \n\nHere\nare two of my past projects: \n\nFirst\nmeeting of International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers\n(Menla, NY): \n\nhttp://aquirkimagery.com/grandmotherscouncil/ \n\nBassline\nCircus (London, UK): \n\nhttp://aquirkimagery.com/bassline/ \n\n“Students\nin middle school age, in general are not much motivated to learn a\nlanguage like Mandarin Chinese until the context and experience is\nmeaningful to them. Many of them are not inherently interested in the\nlanguage itself, but their eagerness to explore and understand more\ncan be fueled by having experiences that connect them to the people\nwho speak the language, and how they live, think, communicate and\nexpress.” - Xin Maya Wang \n   Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch your fleet, capture ports, and wage war in the absolutely epic board game for 2-4 players. In Empires at Sea, you play as one of four nations, and work to amass the largest empire at the end of 15 rounds of play. During each round, History confers benefits and setbacks to each nation, while the Weather limits (and occasionally improves) movement around a to-scale map of the Atlantic.  Breaking News We've been funded!!! Thanks everyone for all the support. That means these stretch goals can become a reality! Help us out!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to understand Empires at Sea is to follow along with our walkthrough. We're doing one round of play each day until the end of the campaign, check it out:  \nRound 1: Hoist the Sails \n \nRound 2: Famine & Gales \n \nRound 3: Thick Fog & Dead Pirates \n \nRound 4: The War of Jenkin's Ear \n \nRound 5: Wars & Winds \n \nRounds 6 & 7: The Second Era \n \nRound 8: West Wind & Crisis \n \nRound 9: Umm... our notes to Round 9 were lost at sea... \nRounds 10-13: The Third Era Begins \n \nRounds 14 & 15: The End \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Here is a quick overview of the core elements of the game: \nPlayers each command a nation: America, France, Britain or Spain \nPlayers take command of ports, which each produce resources \nResources are used to buy bigger and stronger ships \nShips are used to attack your enemies and to settle new ports \nEach Round opens with a History Card, which hurts or helps one nation or another based on the actual impact of the actual historical event. \nA Weather Card is played, limiting or improving movement for all players for the Round (e.g., ships can only move North and East) \nEach player then takes a turn, first by by playing a Captain's Card (used to launch a ship, advance your military, strengthen a port, etc) and then by sailing their fleet to take command of new ports, trade, or attack their enemies. \nThe combat system is based on a roll of the dice, plus modifiers for ship size, the weather gauge, military advancements, and Captain's Orders. \nAt the end of the round, all players may bribe the Pirate. The highest bidder gets to use this ship to attack their enemies.  \n The rules are pretty straightforward (there are no tracks to manage for example), but the deck composition, weather, powerful history events, random starting ports, and the combat system create a ton of variety and lead to exceptional, balanced gameplay regardless of the number of players.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis guy has no face yet, it's our highest level reward. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n41 Miniature Model Ships \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOver 150 cards with beautiful 18th Century Artwork \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMap is perfectly to scale and huge at 20\" x 30\" \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Beautiful Art.  Our art comes from the greatest artists of the 18th and 17th centuries, from Turner and Manet to Stanfield and a host of contemporaries who painted these beautiful ships.  \n\nHistory Cards.  History dramatically drives strategy for the Round. If the US throw a Tea Party, they dump 5 gold into the ocean. After the Congress of Vienna, the European nations can't initiate military action. History can be brutal and unpredictable, and a wise leader anticipates the future and plans accordingly. \n\nMovement System. The Weather Cards and movement actually make it feel like sailing. You get stuck. You can't quite make it. Ships run away to avoid war, or hide behind islands and in little coves. The map is almost perfectly to scale (I moved only Reykjavik), and really mirrors the 18th century naval experience. \n\nCombat Consequences. In naval warfare of the 1800s, both ships were able to fire cannons and so even an attacking ship risked being sunk by the defender. The same is true in Empires at Sea, both Attacker and Defender fire their cannons (i.e., roll the dice) and if the total attack is great enough, sink the opponent's ship. \n\nBribing the Pirate. Every Round ends with all players effectively playing poker for strongest battle unit on the game board. You secretly select an amount of gold to bribe the Pirate, and if you win, you get to use this Ship of the Line against your opponents this turn. But Bribes cost gold, which translates to Empire Points at the end of the game. \"What do you do Jack? What do you do?\" \n\nDynamic Gameplay. Empires feels like 2 or 3 different games in one. The First Era is all about expansion, bribery of the pirate, and resource accumulation. The Second Era is where you begin to launch the more powerful elements of your fleet and advance your military. The Third Era is mostly warfare and fortification of your holdings.  \n\nGreat Replay Value. The game begins with each player assigned to a random port. Sometimes you can expand unhindered, sometimes war is brutal even from the first turn. Sometimes your Frigate is trapped in New Orleans because of the weather, and sometimes every single setback that could befall a nation over the course of History comes to pass in a single game.  \n\nThe Proper Length. The two player variant takes about 60 minutes after you learn to play, and the four player game is just under two hours. If you prefer to extend gameplay, you can do so by playing Empires to 18 or 21 rounds.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a very trusty Captain's Log Book with all the detail about how to play Empires at Sea. Please note that this is still a work in progress, we will be updating this as we move to printing (and incorporating changes from other play testers). \n\n\nClick to download a copy of the manual. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A big thanks to all the folks who have chipped in to make Empires at Sea possible. For more about the history of making the game, check out the earlier Instagram posts or this great post on the making of the map .  \n\n\nAmy hard at work. She is the best. \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges While this is my first board game, I have successfully developed many products (albeit always software) over the years. \n\nThere are some unique challenges in manufacturing and distribution, and in an effort to keep this risks mitigated I am using only top-tier manufacturing facilities. This does raise our costs, but we want a job very well done with the maximum amount of support in the process. It's a big game too, lots of pieces, so costs are going to run a bit higher than I had hoped.\n\nSimilarly, I will be leveraging Amazon for all the fulfillment. Perhaps not the cheapest option, but by far the most effective. \n\nThere is still a lot of work to do. Every element requires time and attention, but I am hopeful that folks will see the awesomeness of this game, back the project, and lend a hand with ideas and support as we move through the process.

    "textDescription": "Story \"Cinderella Skeleton, the Musical\" Based on Robert D. San Souci's award winning book, \"Cinderella Skeleton, the Musical\" promises to bring fresh, original, professional theatre for family audiences to New Haven, Connecticut! Pantochino Productions hopes this project will be the first of many to entertain the young and the young at heart in this urban, culturally diverse city. \"Cinderella Skeleton, the Musical\" is a super cool, edgy version of the classic tale of the girl who wants to go to the ball. But this time, the setting is a graveyard and everyone is...well...dead!  Here's how the book describes her: Cinderella Skeleton \n \n Was everything a ghoul should be:\n Her build was long and lean and lank;\n Her dankish hair hung down in hanks;\n Her nails were yellow; her teeth were green-\n The ghastliest haunt you've ever seen. The story remains intact and familiar...there is a handsome (albeit dead) Prince, Ugly Stepsisters and of course a ball. Boneyard Acres is the macabre and magical setting where this innocently creepy, very funny tale takes place. With a proposed opening in mid-October, \"Cinderella Skeleton, the Musical\" will be a great Halloween treat! Pantochino Productions Pantochino is Connecticut's brand new, ridiculously entertaining theatre company. Created by the award-winning team of Bert Bernardi and Jimmy Johansmeyer, Pantochino is hoping to entertain audiences of all ages. We've successfully created After School Drama Clubs and are currently tour Connecticut schools, venues and festivals with our one-of-a-kind, inimitable brand of comedy and drama. Also in the works are two new musicals, an interactive theatre experience, and the further development of the wicked comedy \"Lifeboat, Dahling!\" We're asked all the time, \"Where is your theatre?\" We don't have one. Instead, we are bringing our shows to other stages in Connecticut. We're are creating partnerships with other companies and one day, when we grow up, have a theatre all our own! About this project... We've got a hot show on our hands! And we have a loyal fan base who has followed us over the years. We have the great city of New Haven which has everything going for it...except a professional theatre for young audiences and their families. We want to see this worthy musical realized on stage, give our fans and followers a memorable theatre experience and provide the greater New Haven area with a family-friendly, affordable and fun-filled night on the town. Pantochino has located the perfect venue to host the show. Very exciting! Bringing the show to life means creating costumes, sets, puppets, and props. It will take a team of designers and technicians. We'll need lighting and sound and stage managers and house managers. Certainly we'll need a box office and tickets and advertising. We'll need the best actors, singers, dancers to play all the parts! The list goes on an on. Supporting this project will help cover the myriad of costs to bring \"Cinderella Skeleton, the Musical\" to life. Should we succeed in raising the funds, and producing the show, Pantochino Productions can continue to bring similar programming to the area--enriching, enlightening and engaging audiences of all ages with our ridiculously entertaining brand of theatre!

    "textDescription": "Story Update - We did it! With two days to spare we reached past our goal. We still have time for a final stretch goal: \n\n\n\n\n\nIf we reach $10,000, I'll be able to complete the most important of the online resources (a series of essays and video blogs about how to run your own Solstice), and skype extensively with organizers for the currently-in-production local Solstices (Seattle, Bay Area, Ottawa, Leipzig, and the potential ones in Boston and Los Angeles). In particular, I'd also be able to travel to the SF Bay Area to personally help with their December 13th event. Last year the Bay put together their first Solstice on short notice with barely any collaboration with me. They got 80 attendees and a lot of great feedback. But it also became clear that there's a particular aesthetic and energy that I've honed over the years, that's hard to explain or teach over the internet, that could have pushed it even farther. So each year, I'd like to run two Solstices if I can, one of them working with local organizers to showcase how the event can work at it's best. Then, in following years those organizers can take that aesthetic and energy and either run with it or use it as inspiration for something uniquely theirs. This is also an opportunity to experiment. You can only learn so much running one event a year. By running two events firsthand, I'll be able to try different things at each one and give them somewhat different focuses. Since the Bay has the second largest community of existing Secular Solstice Celebrators, it makes sense to give them that focus this year. Here's hoping I can work directly with you guys! The Story So Far: Last year, we kickstarted a new winter holiday. We had a huge festival in NYC that was featured in the New York Times and Huffington Post . Across the world, people gathered for intimate Solstice celebrations. They sang and told stories of how humanity has overcome darkness, through science and civilization. This year, we're doing more. I want to coordinate at least 3 major events, and create more resources for people who want to run their own celebrations.I want us to come together and create something beautiful. I want us to establish traditions that endure through the ages. I need your help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Goal: $7500 for the NYC event The minimum financial goal this year is the same as last year: $7500 to run a Solstice event in New York City. I'll be personally overseeing this, working with other local secular organizations to make it happen. The event will be on December 20th, Solstice Eve. We'll be trying some new things - tables to sit around and food to nibble throughout the event. Cushions to sit on. I want people to feel like they've been welcomed into an intimate living room. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople will be invited to bring a memento of a hardship they faced - a loved one they lost or a trial they overcame, as well as a memento of hope for tomorrow. Together, we'll create a memorial and tribute to our past and future.Plus, the songs that have grown to be traditional - both the music unique to the humanist perspective (Brighter Than Today , Uplift ), and popular hits that ties in with our themes of darkness, knowledge and rebirth (Do You Realize , Here Comes the Sun ). Plus some new surprises. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll have a moment outside, looking up at the winter sky - a guided meditation through a cosmic perspective, from our small blue marble to the outermost reaches of the universe. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goal: $15000 to build a movement In years past, I've focused on running one large, polished Solstice event. Many of the people who've come have then been inspired to run their own local events - bringing fresh perspectives while sticking to the core themes of science, civilization and the journey through the darkness. But running a Solstice is a complicated feat - not only are there are lot of logistical tasks, but finding a vision for the event that feels right can be a difficult skill. I've learned a lot in the past four years about how to do this. Organizations in Boston, San Francisco and LA have also expressed interest in putting together a big event. Each large Solstice will require local people working to pull it off. But there's no way around it - coordinating all of this will be a full time job. I want to work personally with each group running an event, both to help things go smoothly, and to ensure that each one gives people a sense of transcendent connection.  If we raise $15,000, I'll be able to: \nPersonally oversee two Solstice events - one in the Bay Area on December 6th, and one in NYC on December 20th. \nSkype with people running their own event who'd like advice \nPut together singalong videos, for groups that don't have a lot of musical talent but want to enjoy singing. \n Regardless, we'll have the existing resources: Music and lyrics and humanistculture.bandcamp.com , additional resources at humanistculture.com , and the Solstice Eve Book of Traditions (The PDF and hardcopy available as kickstarter rewards). Rewards UPDATE: We've decided to upgrade the Book of Traditions package. If you get the $100 book reward, you'll also receive the music download. And, of course, a ticket to the NYC event (or any other large events that charge an entry fee to cover their venue costs) Purchasing the book also will guarantee at least one skype call with me, if you'd like help setting up your own Solstice event (even if we don't hit the $15,000 stretch goal. If we do hit the goal I'll have enough time to work with more people in more detail, whether they've purchased the book) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrighter Than Today has already taken root as a genuine holiday, becoming a cornerstone to the communities it's been introduced to. But it has the potential to become a global phenomenon, changing culture, making rationalists, humanists and atheists feel connected to each other, to the world, and to the future of humanity.\n To do all this, it needs your help. It needs the funding to run inspiring events that act as a lightning rod for the public imagination. And it needs individuals take on the challenge of introducing a new tradition to their community, and putting in the logistical effort to make that happen.  This is only just the beginning. Atheists need more than one holiday. We need a thriving musical, artistic movement that makes us feel proud of our culture, that can keep exploring new music and ritual for the modern era. Brighter Than Today is the proof of concept that this is possible. If it succeeds, I hope the people who bring it to their communities can later work together on other, more ambitious projects. \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The two most obvious challenges are the same as last year - venues can fall through and then it's a scramble to find a new one. This happened last year, and I resolved it. I'm confident in my ability to do so again if need be. I'm also taking more precautions to make sure every t is crossed and i dotted with the venues I settle on.\n\nIf I get sick the week of the event, I wouldn't be able to run it. Like last year, I'll be making sure to be safe and constantly wash my hands in the days leading up to it.\n\nLast year, I didn't account for how long it'd take to put together some of my rewards. This year, I have those rewards already created and can ship them as soon as the kickstarter is over.\n\nThe most risky thing this year is the plan to coordinate several large events that I don't have direct control over. I can help each local Solstice to run smoothly and work one-on-one with people, offering advice on how to make them beautiful. But when all is said and done I can't guarantee that any given event will go as planned.\n\nAmong the most important advice I'll be giving people is how to make sure that, at the very least, there's a minimal viable product. Even if professional musicians or large venues fall through, it's possible to come together in a Charlie Brown Christmas fashion, and create something simple and elegant. \n\nI can promise to do my best, to ensure that anyone who wants it has access to Solstice cheer.

Our goal is to get these 3 humble and compelling college students onto Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' film set as extras.

We are all very excited to work with Skylab Studios and feel everyone involved with our music will benefit from this project. We didn't think it was fair to the people close to us to fund raise for the full studio time, so we're aiming to receiving funds as a mean of support. There are a lot of costs to factor when outside of the studio such as travel, lodging, and food. Just remember your contribution helps feed the process whether it goes to directly to recording, keeping us sustained, or our mode of transportation sustained, or shelter while we are away from our homes but most of all the contributions feed the music and that makes our contributors true patrons.Thanks everyone! Rock on and help us keep rockin' too! Risks and challenges Our biggest challenge after the recording will be getting all the mixing and mastering done just right that our listeners will not be able to stop themselves from putting the EP on repeat.

Tell me about this graphic! About two years ago I made a satirical illustration based on a photo  I took of my local skate park. To me, it's a silly image, but one that is also tinged with love. No one comes to my crappy skatepark, so repping it as a \"Locals Only\" park is as absurd as it is redundant, but this image expresses my love for home. Even though the transitions are impossible, the anti graffiti paint is garish and and no one famous has ever set foot on these grounds, I still have love for my stomping grounds, imperfect as they may be. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what's this Kickstarter about? Some friends saw this illustration and wanted me to make it into a shirt. I want that to happen too, but the upfront costs of getting a shirt printed, plus having to guess what the size distribution will be is prohibitively expensive and complicated.I've decided to use Kickstarter as a pre-order system. In return for your  support we're offering the chance to get this limited edition shirt, public love and even a hand screened poster of the illustration. I know, right? Legit. Tell me about the shirt. We're going to use the highest quality shirt possible, they'll fit like American Apparel, without the blatant sexism. They're going to be printed locally by my friend, Mike Braman, of Print Pro USA .To insure that you get exactly the shirt you want, we're going to print a few extra shirts for each size. Once all our backers get their rewards, we'll sell any extras (for $35 ) here . Who are you? My name is Trevor Christensen . I'm a photographer from Provo, Utah. I like zines, graffiti and spreading art. Making things makes me happy.I have a question for you! Sweet. I have an answer for you.

For now, we're just thrilled this launch date is here! We've been selected as a Staff Pick! Hooray! Additionally, two more rewards are available: a local pick-up reward for Toronto and GTA participants to avoid shipping costs, and a limited early bird reward for reduced book price! NEW STRETCH GOAL: FOR EVERYONE $1000 RAISED, WE WILL DONATE COPIES OF OUR ANTHOLOGY TO LOCAL LIBRARIES! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Where is Home?\" is a comic anthology project that aimed to bring together artist friends who graduated from Sheridan's BAA Animation program. It then expanded to include many artists with varying backgrounds and talents, from outside of Toronto as well. Coming together to create a work of not only comic storytelling, some of us instead chose static visual illustrative storytelling as well. The theme was chosen by consensus, and the artists set to work on their own unique interpretations.Over a year later, fifteen artists have prepared this 60 page, full colour anthology to share with you. For most of us, it's our first production in print, but we're no less excited for this than we were, say, when we first saw our animated films on screen! It's a new and exciting venture for us, and now that all of the artwork is completed, we hope you'll help us make that leap from screen to printed page. \n\n\n\n\nFront cover artwork by Mallory Carlson, back cover by Alex Stepanov and Paul Halasa \n \n\n \n\n\n The anthology will be printed and perfect bound, sized at 6x9 at 60 pages, and including an ISBN for proper inclusion amongst other books in your personal library. It's lightweight, colourful, and full of stories we're sure you'll love drawn by talented people you might not yet have heard of, but won't soon forget! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur challenge lies in printing costs, and in sharing our work with many people. We are equally appreciative of your financial support as we are with you sharing this project with others who might enjoy our stories about HOME .  Our $4000 goal is calculated to offset the following costs: printing fees, shipping costs, reward costs, as well as fees and taxes. Meeting our goal will mean that we can afford to print 250 copies of WHERE IS HOME? as well as send the rewards thanking our supporters. Should we exceed the goal, in addition to expanding our print run size, our artists will receive compensation for their efforts on this project, as rightly they deserve for all their hard work! Since this is our first project of this nature, we do not presume to set our goal higher just to ensure ourselves compensation; this project's first and foremost goal is sharing our HOME with you. CURRENT STRETCH GOAL:  For every $1000 raised, we will donate 2 COPIES of our anthology to a local library! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Here is just a sampling of artwork from the \"WHERE IS HOME?\" anthology! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Please note that these are just random pages from our various artists, and they do not appear in this order within the anthology itself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Now for the goodies you can choose from!

    "textDescription": "Story  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollowind is a vast megalopolis that fifty years ago, thanks to Merlin’s Edict, managed to overthrow the tyranny of arcane families; since that very moment it has been fighting the remaining survivors of the Purge. The Bureaus represent the first line of defense in their daily battle against enemies within and without, observing the motto: order, reveal, and persecute. Anyone attempting to break this new balance, conquered with the blood of thousands, will have to face the Bureaus. The arcanists are always plotting, and people must remain vigilant.  The Silence of Hollowind is a Urban Fantasy role playing game, adaptable to many rules systems with the addition of setting-specific mechanics to enhance gameplay (Savage Worlds  is the first system we will design for; the 10,000€ stretch goal unlocks D&D5E and FATE conversions). It is a complex and detailed setting, aesthetically reminiscent of 1930s United States but populated by Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and countless fantasy creatures living within the oppressive Hollowind, a metropolis rich with mysteries and contradictions where magic is outlawed and whoever makes use of it is hunted down as a criminal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core book for “The Silence of Hollowind ” will amount to about 130 pages, which might increase based on the stretch goals.  \nWithin the book you will find:   \n\nA deeply structured setting, filled with mysteries.  \nSeveral play styles, from purely investigative games to action-pulp adventures.  \nPlaying the role of lowly Order agents, skilled Revealers or brave Persecutors. If stretch goals allow for it, you will be able to play as Arcanists and see things from a different perspective.  \nDozens of NPCs and ideas for investigative sessions.  \nA variety of conversions for different rule systems. The initial project included compatibility with Savage Worlds only, but stretch goals have already unlocked conversions for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition and for Evil Hat's FATE rpg. Each system conversion will be released through its own free PDF.  \nLayout and art direction aiming to evoke the setting and resemble dossiers from the very Bureaus.  \nA map of the City of Hollowind! \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might be wondering why we didn’t simply choose a single existing system, or why we didn’t custom-make one for Hollowind. I can tell you we spent a lot of time on this decision, but in the end we realized we wanted this game to be approachable by as many people as possible, with as little effort as possible. This means relying on widespread systems, allowing every group to choose the one they are most comfortable with. Each rules conversion will provide everything you need to adapt your system to our setting in a few easy steps, keeping your focus on the game, not the conversion.   \nAt the same time, we will develop special rules for the Savage Worlds conversion (this is the first system we will design for) such as “Interrogation Scenes”, “Arcane Plague”, “Arcane Fogs” and several Edges dedicated to playing Hollowind. All these rules will be released within a free PDF. \n*UPDATE:  We have reached the €10,000 stretch goal, thus unlocking conversion documents for D&D 5th Edition, and FATE! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE: Seeker is a roleplaying game currently on Kickstarter, (http://kck.st/2hr1nHu) with a generic system that could very well fit The Silence of Hollowind. This means we could add Seeker to the list of conversion modules for Hollowind if we reach that goal!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven their power, wizards have always been considered akin to Gods. And like Gods they built Zapiri, forcing the ground itself to rise above all of Hollowind, the vast city founded by the sorcerers’ servants and submerged in the arcane mists that slowly fell from the dwelling of the Gods.   \nDespite their power, they were unable to save themselves from the spreading Arcane Plague. The magical illness struck regardless of lineage or position, and the panicking populace begged their masters for salvation but received no answer. The outcry was first moved by fear, then grew ever more violent, culminating into bloodshed and repression. Only the direct intervention of the Primage Merlin was able to bring temporary peace: he promulgated the Edict, which limited the use of magic. Then, he disappeared from the pages of history.   \nSadly, Merlin’s Edict was not sufficient to protect the Arcane Families: it simply proved to all unarcanes (those without magical powers) that the use of magic was indeed the cause of Arcane Plague. Urged by the public outcries, the Families granted increasing rights to the people; part of the reason was that many wizards had already been killed by the epidemic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, such a secret could not be kept for long; when the people learned the truth, a ferocious rebellion broke out. The insurgents assaulted Zapiri with the help of Giants, cornering the already weakened Arcane Families.   \nIn the darkest moments of the Purge, the arcane clouds over Zapiri ignited with a fire that killed thousands among insurgents, mages and monsters. That event marked the end of Magocracy and the beginning of the Government of Hollowind. Zapiri was quarantined and the Bureaus were created to prevent the mages from regaining their position. The Bureaus’ names form the motto known by every free citizen of Hollowind from their very birth: Order, Reveal, Persecute.  \nForty years from that day, Hollowind is fragmented by arcane mists that split its territory into dozens of Urban Islands, safe districts swimming in a sea of magical fog. Due to the Giants’ help and the vertiginous technological evolution freed from the Mages’ yoke, the Islands can now boast towering buildings, cars, trains and firearms. The many races populating Hollowind are a true powder keg of ethnic tension, threatening to explode at any moment; fear of losing what has been so hard to earn led the Government to fight fire with fire, employing the use of manite: a mineral composed of crystallized mana acting as fuel for Hollowind’s latest technologies, making it the most advanced country in the entire world.  \nBut at what price? \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to give The Silence of Hollowind a try and discover what it has to offer, you can download the free scenario “Just a Taste”, developed in collaboration with GGstudio (Italian publisher for Savage Worlds )!    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core book for “The Silence of Hollowind ” will allow you to play the role of agents from the three Bureaus fighting against dangers criminal and arcane. Each bureau has different goals and embodies a different approach to the game.  \n\n\nBureau of Order : Officers handling everyday cases that do not involve magic and aren’t relevant to the entire megalopolis. They investigate murders, robberies, burglaries and such (apparently) non-arcane crimes. You might think of them as policemen with firefighting duties. Suggested option for those who are new to the setting or prefer low-magic investigations. Still as deadly as other choices.  \n\nBureau of Revelation : The best detectives among all Bureaus, tasked with solving arcane or high-profile mysteries. They may deal with common crimes if these prove especially complex or unusual, such as with a serial killer or a smuggling network. You might think of them as federal agents. Suggested option for those who like magic to be involved in their investigation, and possibly to face monsters and deadly arcanists.  \n\nBureau of Persecution : Special squads trained to fight wizards and arcane monsters. They are the hammer of the Bureaus: their duty is to forcefully annihilate threats without hesitation, since their intervention is synonymous with a desperate situation. They might also lend their support to other Bureaus if a specialist is needed to capture or locate an enemy. You might think of them as S.W.A.T. squads. Suggested option for those groups who’d rather have deadly confrontations and little investigation in their games.  \n \nNeedless to say, if the crowdfunding proves successful we plan to expand the possibilities by including new races, archetypes and even the opportunity to play as Mages! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n *UPDATE: Here’s a government poster by Christian Culicelli, portraying a Gnomish pin-up! This and many other illustrations will form the collection “Hollowind’s Pin-ups” which you will be able to unlock through the appropriate stretch goal! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sound of Hollowind: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere come the Reward Tiers! Every Item will be available in ENGLISH or ITALIAN language (you'll decide in the BackerKit survey).Reward Tiers are totally customizable using Add-ons.    \nNote that all the images of product here are just previews.

Add-ons can also be managed after the Campaign ends, through BackerKit survey. \nWARNING: Little by little we will unlock further add-ons through stretch goals; some of these will be added for free to specific pledge levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to our community achievements!

Additionally, we are supported by: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDicegames Italia : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKnCyEIqkCfQ3bGXdGJgxA Sesso Droga e D&D : https://www.facebook.com/Sesso.Droga.DnD/ Michele Paroli (Consultant and Author of Journey to Ragnarok):https://www.facebook.com/Michele.Paroli.Clown \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspirations for this setting and its themes have been many: the concept of fear and mystery was inspired by 1984; H.P. Lovecraft, Dark Souls, The Order: 1886, Sine Requie (Italian RPG), Vampire: the Masquerade and many other detective stories across all media. The game has developed and grown in the span of several years, becoming a reality thanks to the many people who worked on it and poured themselves into their work, giving life to Hollowind.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Silence of Hollowind is an italian project that we present in two languages: English and Italian. If funded, you're going to choose your version with a BackerKit survey. We'll ship anywhere in the World and, if we succeed, shipping costs will be collected after the Kickstarter Campaign. Estimated shipping costs:  \nPersecutor Officer pledges:  \n\nItaly: up to 7 €  \nEurope: up to 15 € \nUSA/Canada/Other countries: up to 18 € (around 19,2 USD) \n \nRevelator Officer,  Revelator Inspector and Esecutor Officer pledges:   \n\nItaly: up to 10 €   \nEurope: up to 15 €   \nUSA/Canada/Other countries: up to 24 € (around 28,3 USD) \n \nInvestigative Team pledges:   \n\nItaly: up to 15 €   \nEurope: up to 20 €   \nUSA/Canada/Other countries: up to 30 € (around 30,6 USD) \n \nAs soon as possible we'll set a more accurate shipping costs list (may change based on stretch goals). Fees will be collected with BackerKit survey. Once we'll have a precise number of copies to ship, we'll make a deal with a shipping company and we'll be able to set the final Shipping costs list. \n \n Risks and challenges We chose Kickstarter because we need your help to bring this project to the next level. We are all role players or game masters, but we are also creators and artists, well aware of the costs involved by completing such a project.\n\nThe funds will go towards completing Hollowind, making it better, translating it and finally printing it with the quality it deserves; otherwise, our effort would have been for nothing. The project will be finished within a year from the end of this crowdfunding (unless we reach stretch goals that greatly increase the amount of contents)!

It's been done before, but now it's our turn. This album will have a collection of stirring melodies and harmonies that will echo in your mind forever. Little things will remind you of the lyrics or the feeling you got the first time you heard the haunting vocals in songs like, \"Siren.\" Or the tears that came to your eyes when you were reminded of where you were when God found you in, \"Run to You.\"...      These songs are our story. Some of them are your stories. This album has been written thru the life-long, daily and often-times, fleeting moment struggles, triumphs and in the impact of God and his people in our lives. We can't help but share what He has given us and we can't do that without the help of our friends, families and fans.           *****THIS IS HOW IT WORKS VERY IMPORTANT*****1 - On the Right side of your screen you will see a green button that reads \"Back This Project - 1$ Minimum Pledge\"...2 - If you click that button it will take you to a screen that asks you how much you would like to donate and then there are options below that you can select to receive as an \"award\" of sorts. For example, if you donate 25$ to our project we will send you a physical copy of our CD + a few cool completely exclusive band merchandise pieces. 3 - You will then be asked for your credit card information through an Amazon Account (don't worry, this part is simple). If you don't have an Amazon Account you can easily connect it to your credit/debit card thru your bank account which can usually be done instantly, but sometimes it may take a few days to confirm your bank account so take that into consideration if you are planning on donating at the last second! 4 - After you've done the account info, you will confirm and then you're done! Your donation will go into effect immediately, BUT it will not be drawn from your account unless we reach our minimum goal!!! We are currently trying to raise 10,000 dollars to fully and professionally record and produce a 6 song album. HOWEVER, for every 2000 dollars that we get over the 10,000 we will be able to add 1 more song to the album (with a max of 10 songs). That's where you come in. YOU can GREATLY help us reach our goal by sharing this project and our music with your friends and family members! I mean it when I say that every cent counts. It sounds like a lot of money, and it is... but not if it's spread across hundreds or thousands of people. 10,000 = 6 songs (Minimum Goal for project completion) 12,000 = 7 songs14,000 = 8 songs16,000 = 9 songs18,000 = 10 song FULL LENGTH ALBUM + The more you decide to invest in our music the cooler stuff you will get. We have some awesome band merchandise that you will be able to see very soon! Thank you for reading and helping us reach our project goal! You cannot imagine how much we appreciate it!!! This is one of our music videos ~ \"Heart So Heavy\" - written by Adam Hamby, performed by Adam Hamby and Cherish Hamby of Dark Waters \nThis is the \"tentative\" list of songs that we will be putting on the album!!! 1 - Heart So Heavy (above)2 - Cage (the song in the intro video)3 - Taking Water (epic song about a shipwreck)4 - Run to You (song about the only place you need to go when you're hurting is, Jesus. spiritual/gospel tune)5 - Amsterdam (this is what happens when you lose a loved one to something other than death) 6 - Drunk Again (concerning alcoholism) 7 - Siren (when addiction calls and drains the life from its victim)8 - Collide (it's what happens when 2 suns crash into each other) 9 - The Rains (stirring song about a mothers battle with cancer...)10 - Greatest of Fools (when heart breaks leave us shakin' our heads)11 - SURPRISE COVER???? ;) Risks and challenges We have been looking for a way to fund a new album for years and can't seem to find the right amount of money at the right time. We *know* that if we can get the money the first time, we'll never have to ask again. There's a great saying in Nashville that goes, \"Every over-night success, is 10 years in the making.\" It's true. We're not trying to win a contest, impress some ridiculous celebrity judge or trick you into buying a garage band mix CD. This album will be Grammy worthy and that is one of our goals. \n\nOur civilization wasn't built by one man, but many. That will be said about our album.

    "textDescription": "Story What is LA Int'l Student Film Fest? The Los Angeles International Student Film Festival will take place June 7th, 2014. Located in Downtown, Los Angeles at Regal Cinemas LA Live the festival will help deepen the already burgeoning artistic community in downtown by exhibiting student films from not only the Los Angeles area, but from international cities spanning the globe. While there are many film festivals in the LA area there are few dedicated solely to supporting student filmmakers and even less that include high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the same festival. Our programming is aimed towards creating a rich pallet of unique perspectives from around the world thereby exposing our audience to new concepts, stories, and people.  LA International Student Film Fest is a project of the Pasadena Arts Council’s EMERGE Fiscal Sponsorship Program. Donations to the festival are tax deductible under Federal ID 95-2540759. The Pasadena Arts Council is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that has been facilitating, empowering and advocating for the arts since 1964. What your donation will go towards? Our goal here on Kickstarter is to get to $1,500 and we can only do that with your help! The $1,500 will go towards helping us pay for the theater space at Regal Cinemas LA Live where the screenings will take place and for the Closing Ceremony where Student Awards will be announced and filmmakers can network and discuss their work! Any extra donations that take us above our goal will go towards program and operating expenses that make the festival possible and help us create an even better experience for all the audience members and filmmakers involved.  Why Support Young Filmmakers? With nationwide budget cuts to education, support for art programs and specifically film programs that require expensive equipment, has become less of a priority to schools who are more focused on students standardized test scores. This in turn leaves students with only half the means they need to achieve a well rounded education and discourages them from self expression that is vital to our societal health and capacity for growth. Throughout history art has been one of our strongest forms of communication and an indicator of what is happening in our society. Now in the twenty first century the art of filmmaking is one of our most capable tools for students to tell their stories through and it is one of the least supported in our school systems. You Can Help Us Provide a Solution. The Los Angeles International Student Film Festival will fill this void by creating support for students where schools may be lacking. We will host an annual film festival dedicated solely to screening work created by students enrolled in high school, undergraduate and graduate programs. By focusing on student films on an international level we are bringing together a global community of filmmakers who share the common goal of education and artistic expression. Through celebrating filmmakers at varying stages in their schooling we strive to create a dynamic environment that offers inspiration and valuable networking opportunities.  Most importantly the festival will give talented students a sound board from which to be heard and motivate them to further explore their craft and grow as artists. Risks and challenges With any project comes a multitude of risks! Our biggest risk at this point is not being able to fulfill our goal of $1,500 and in turn not receiving any of the donations to help fund the Festival. Just launching this Kickstarter and reaching out for a helping hand is a challenge, but one we are excited and ready to take on.\n\nWhen we meet our goal the next challenge will be to get all of our backer incentives sent out and fulfilled. Our whole team will be working as hard as possible to get you your incentives on time as we all know our project could not have been a success without you!

    "textDescription": "Story The Idea is Pure Genius; But Why? Just Another Reality Show , came to the mind of Kyle Lazorko in August of 2011, originally going to be an in-school mini \"documentary/comedy\" series depicting what really goes on in students brains. However, after a few petty student arguments and stumbling across Survivor that same day Kyle decided to change the theme to a reality show, renaming the old \"Us Teenagers\" to the title you all know, \"Just Another Reality Show\" or JARS for short. Shortly after producers, Rishi Dutt and Jordan Tullis came on board with Taara Advani and Hoshea Hart joining shortly after. \n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Lazorko Kyle is a freshman at Philadelphia University and the original head creator of Just Another Reality Show. Hoshea Hart Hoshea is a junior at Germantown Friends School and is another producer of JARS, her main focus in the series was directed towards seasons 2 and 3. Jordan Tullis Jordan is a freshman at New York University and is another producer of JARS, his main focus was directed towards seasons 1 and 2. Rishi Dutt Rishi is a freshman at Drexel University and is a producer of JARS, he has directed attention in all fields across seasons 1, 2 and 3. - What We Need The $$$ For! We are just a group of teenagers ourselves, and we are running on a low-to-zero budget, again. If and once we raise the money needed that money will go to transportation (to make easy access to heavy objects that need to be brought to the competition area), food (people gotta eat you know, this isn't Survivor, no rice and beans here), equipment (which one of the more vital aspects of Season 3, cameras, SD cards, mics etc, the better the quality the more enjoyable the product). But most importantly, we need money for the PRIZE! 100$ in Season 1, 500$ in Season 2, the anticipated prize for Season 3 is 500$ again, but that all depends on how much is pledged. :) - Did you ever hit any bumps in the road? Season 1 (2012) and Season 2 \n (2013) were each filmed in June and released to the public by \nAugust/September of their respective years. Despite not having the \naudience Kyle anticipated he did not give up and swore to do better in \nseasons to come, and after running on a low to zero budget Kyle, and the\n rest of the JARS Committee anticipate that Season 3 (2014) will be the beginning of a legend. - What Can You Get On You're Shirt? \n\"Hit 'em like they stole something!\" \n\"It's O'Clay\" \n#SeductiveSloths \n#DeviousDonkeys \nPoppin' it At CVS Since 2013 \n\n (Black letters on white shirt) But What About The Cartoons?! \n\n\nThe Outline Reward \n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Colorful Reward \n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe HQ Reward \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges Challenges is a word that describes JARS better than any other, in more ways than 1. Since Season 1 began, JARS has endured multiple obstacles either, pre, post or during production, all of which have been some what devastating. There are always contestant drop-outs, at the last second, due to conflicting activities or just a sudden disinterest, whatever the case may be this hurts JARS tremendously and probably has the most significant impact.\n\nAlso there are several health and injury risks that could occur during the competition, which at least 1 has happened on each season. And then there is the weather, which was a huge hindering factor during the second day of Season 2, so much so that the competition actually had to move to an inside location.\n\nFinally, there is the major drawback and overall hoop that we have to jump through. \n\nTime. \n\nEditing is a tedious and often long process. After JARS is completed there is a time period of 2 1/2 months to get everything finished, episode wise. Between the end of June to the middle of August there are countless hours that are spent editing and making sure that an episode is of the highest quality. Time is precious, and we all know one thing; time is seldom on your side. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

The Backroads EP is a 4-track EP of tracks that didn't quite fit onto my first full length, Storms Over Sunset.  This 4 track album tells a similar story from start to finish.  Each track is a deep progressive house track that almost flows seamlessly into the following track. \n .soundcloud .card {\n max-height: 250px;\n }\n .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {\n height: 220px;\n }\n .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {\n height: unset;\n }\n \nBut enough about the album, the reason I've decided to ask YOU for some help with funding this album is because this album is going to be out on digital retailers through my own imprint.  I'm mainly just focusing on iTunes, Google Music, etc.  However, because there's not much money coming through to me via my album sales (since it's mostly free), I've decided to release this one, and ask for some funding assistance. There's a number of rewards / packages and I hope that my fans / supporters can find it in their hearts to support this project.  We really don't need that much to meet the goal, and it would cover mix / master / distribution / and a little extra so I can pay my friend for the album art, even though he said I didn't have to. Thanks everybody!! -- Forekast Risks and challenges Mixdown issues: problems during the mixing phase of the album in normal scenarios could present a delay in the release.

    "textDescription": "Story Hello, listeners! I'm setting up this Kickstarter with the intention of improving the podcast and trying to make it easier to get out episodes of the podcast a bit quicker. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to replace my current laptop (specifically with a Lenovo Yoga Book, which has a stylus feature which will allow me to save written notes to it and therefore make it easier to organize and outline episodes) and get a better recording set-up to clean up the sound on the episodes. I'm currently using a five-dollar clip-on microphone and my iPhone to record episodes, and while it's working out I'd love to improve everything to sound more professional. I'd also like to put any remaining money towards things such as the Soundcloud subscription for the podcast, finally setting up a website for the podcast, and buying resources such as books I need for future episodes. I'd really like to make this podcast the best it possibly can be. Risks and challenges The biggest challenge I have with making the podcast is a combination of money and time. I work a full-time day job and also write with the intent of hopefully being traditionally published (right now, I'm self-publishing), and money is always tight. Due to an issue with my previous employer, I needed to quit my job at the beginning of October and only got a new job a few weeks ago. Therefore, money has been tighter than usual. \n\nI've been intending to replace my laptop to something lighter and more portable to make it easier for me to take notes for the podcast on the go. My current laptop is a cheap bulky replacement I picked up on the fly and it's not realistic for me to bring it with me every night to my factory job. This presents a challenge in that I end up handwriting notes, which I then have to transfer to my computer, all of which adds more time to the research and preparation process. \n\nI also would prefer to record under better conditions. As of right now, I do so in my living room with a cheap microphone using an app on my iPhone. The challenge here is that I live on a main street, and there's plenty of street noise to try and work around. As it is, I try to record in the middle of the night on my days off to try to cut down on the noise. \n\nYour donation will go directly into improving the podcast. Since it's just me doing all the work, I'll be able to immediately put the money toward putting out a better production. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Whose imagination wouldn’t be captured by the mention of a s’mores wedding cake or pumpkin pancakes served with apple butter , or peach sauce made with maple syrup or a sausage wrapped in a pancake, tied with a piece of bacon ?  I’ve already spent a few months experimenting with these foods – to test the feasibility of this endeavor. And, let me tell you, the results have all been utterly delicious. \n\n So I’m forging ahead – prepared to create all of the favorites. The minimum number of recipes will be 60. If lots of folks get behind this, and we raise more money than the goal amount, I'll add more and more recipes. Regardless of the number, they’ll all be packaged in a pretty-yet-usable 8” x 10” hardcover, colorful book. \n\n I am so excited to be sharing this project with you all! Yes, the reward for your $30 donation is a first-edition copy of the Eat Like A Gilmore Cookbook . But the fun doesn’t stop there! By supporting this Kickstarter, you also have the opportunity to suggest recipes, test recipes, submit your own recipe, and even showcase your business or specialized expertise! \n\n Your donations give this project wings – funding everything from food to photos, proofing, printing, and postage! Also, I’ve set up the timeline so I can get these rewards to you all in December, in time for the holidays.  With a goal of $20,000, this is a \"break even\" scenario, paying for ingredients, photography, editing, printing, shipping, postage, Kickstarter fees, and a myriad of other expenses. If we raise more - you'll get more: a bigger book with more tasty recipes! \n\n  \n\n \n\n\nHere's a peek at the cover art for the book! \n \n\n \n PROFESSIONALLY PHOTOGRAPHED & DESIGNED \n\n The book will contain full-color, beautiful photographs taken by a professional photographer with special talent for photographing food. I've yet to choose the final photog - but all of the contenders are top-notch!\n\n From cover to cover, every page will be designed by Brian Anderson , a professional artist with uncanny abilities, who truly “gets” the aesthetic of this project. \n\n . . FOODS FOR EVERY OCCASION This book will be made up of 3 collections – \n\n \n1 – Foods from a small-town diner\n \n2 – Foods served at fancy Friday Night Dinners\n \n3 – Foods served at charming, eclectic, independent inns \n \n Focusing on these three categories provides a broad range of dishes – everything from cheeseburgers to salmon puffs, pancakes to risotto. It encompasses recipes for dishes suitable for: \ndinner parties \nbrunches \nromantic dinners for two  \ngirls’ nights \nlate night binges \npotlucks  \nholiday meals  \n If there’s someone you’d like to impress the heck out of with your mad cooking skills – it’ll have recipes for that, too!\n\n . . \n\n\nBehind-the-scenes shots from Kristi's recent appearance on the television show \"Recipe Hunters\" \n \n\n \n\nKRISTI CARLSON - RECIPE WRITER?\n\n Spending the bulk of my time creating recipes has been a goal of mine for a while now. My grandmother gave me my first cooking lessons when I was a little kid, and I still love experimenting in the kitchen. Though she’s been gone for more than a decade, when I’m cooking or baking, I still feel a strong connection to her. In my career I’ve worked as a cook, a baker, and a caterer – but creating a recipe is different. \n\n It takes artistry wrapped in a detailed, serious – sometimes tenacious - approach. To me, it’s where art and science meet. I like that. I also like having these foods as my inspiration – knowing there is an expectation out there – a list of foods folks expect to have included; high-quality foods with mind-blowing flavor.\n\n  . . Risks and challenges A cookbook project comes with very few real risks.\nHowever, here are a few potential concerns and my plan for overcoming them:\n\nWhat if the recipes are hard to understand or the food doesn't taste good?\n\nI will work with a recipe tester - not a chef, but a regular person who likes to cook at home - and get their feedback to ensure the instructions are clear and food turns out the way it should!\n\nWhat if there are delays?\n\nI've built the schedule for the project allowing for a very realistic amount of time for each step. I will also be updating supporters on a regular basis. If any unforeseeable delay crops up, supporters will know about it, and my solution for it, asap!

Through our products, blog, social media, and events we encourage people to make an active decision to celebrate what’s great in life. We are looking to take this message national through this Kickstarter campaign; but first, a bit more on us. Stacy Menzies, entrepreneur and educator, launched Happy Fix in February 2014 to build a community of Happbassadors who realize that happy feels good™ and understand that, with regular use, positive thinking becomes a habit that improves an individual’s life. For example, experts at the National Institutes of Health, Harvard University, and the Mayo Clinic correlate happiness with better health, with data showing that positive mood and optimism are linked to better health and well-being, with a growing body of evidence showing that happier people can live longer, healthier lives. Happy Fix is the ultimate in personal responsibility; while we acknowledge that there are situations beyond our control, it is our reaction to those events and situations that dictates the outcomes. Happy Fix is a reminder that when something goes wrong, it is within an individual’s power to greet negative situations with a positive reaction. At worst, an individual can neutralize it, and in most cases change the course or his or her entire day, paving the way toward achieving personal and professional goals. It truly is okay to be happy, even in challenging situations.  We developed our HPY logo design to serve as a constant reminder for people that happiness is a choice that’s always within reach, in good times and bad. Our initial sales and customer interaction at events in North Carolina (where we live) were very encouraging, but it's our online sales to people from all over -- places like New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, Baltimore -- and their continuing interactions with us through things like our social media channels that have us really excited. In addition to people buying our comfortable apparel and fun accessories, they're totally living the Happy Fix mantra, in effect becoming happiness ambassadors or, as we like to call them, Happbassadors, helping to spread the message that an individual is not limited by negative situations. So what's this Kickstarter project all about? We want to jump-start the Happy Fix concept and reach more people, both through our products and events. We're bootstrapping, so our ability to produce more apparel and create new designs is limited by how many we sell. We'd like to be able to introduce new accessories as well, like Happy Fix coffee mugs (and maybe Happy Fix coffee) but we're going to have to wait until our sales get pumped up (noticing the Catch-22 yet?). In addition to more products and new designs, we've identified several events coming up this Fall where we could potentially reach tens of thousands of people, but we just don't have the money necessary to exhibit at these events. Speaking of events, we'd also like to create some of our own, including Happy Fix Road Shows and Meetup groups throughout the country where we bring together like-minded individuals and professionals with products and services geared toward positive living and start to build a groundswell of positivity led by newly minted Happbassadors. In sum, this Kickstarter campaign will help fund: - More products - New designs - Event participation (exhibiting) - Happy Fix Road Shows - Happy Fix Meetup Groups - Advertising to build awareness of celebrating what's great in life Risks and challenges Happy Fix has production and distribution nailed down tight for existing products and we've identified vendors to assist with us moving forward with new products and designs.\n\nWe have professional in-house PR, marketing, advertising, and social media support and other resources to promote Happy Fix.\n\nAs far as events, we've exhibited before and have our booth materials together. Stacy Menzies, Happbassador-in-Chief, has a plethora of public speaking experience and is a professional educator, so building successful Road Shows and Meetup groups and engaging enthusiastic new Happbassadors will not be a problem.

This is your chance to become a fast thinking, investment-savvy day trader; but first... get a job!  First, work at the companies on the board to scrape together some cash so you can make trades in the companies you work for. The more employees a company has, the higher the company's stock price.  Buy a company's stock when it's priced low and sell it when it's high to maximize your gains and create greater wealth. When you have enough cash to retire be the first to get to the bank before the volatile market sets you back. If you can do that, you win! Bring the trading floor to your dining room table with Daytrader! Daytrader is for Ages 13 & up, has a playing time of 30+ mins and is for 2 - 6 players. For the complete rules, click here . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost you will receive a big THANK YOU from us in the backers section of the website! We will also send you an exclusive thank you card in the mail or by email (your choice). \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe designers at ITAL/C not only created the amazing artwork for the game but also threw in these original collectors poster pieces just for the kickstarter backers. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 great T-Shirts to choose from. But, don't lose your shirt, invest wisely! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we aren't going to let you leave Wall Street empty-handed! Pledge as THE VICE PRESIDENT or higher and receive a copy of Daytrader. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI enlisted the help of design studio, ITAL/C to give Daytrader a unique and playful look & feel. The design draws inspiration from classic American business signage and simple currency-like illustrations as a tribute to the golden age of finance and Wall Street. The Americana feel they've assigned to the game adds a warm, approachable simplicity to the chaotic world of finance. For more about ITAL/C, please visit their website www.italic-studio.com . \n\n\nThe Daytrader Board \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nRetirement Card. You need one of these to win! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDaytrader comes with 4 stock cards of each company around the board. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Volatile Market Cards. There are 32 cards in the game which can send the game into all kinds of directions. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDaytrader Money. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack of the Daytrader box.

We love the idea of making custom briefcase pawns for ALL the games! These little guys will really take the stock of the game way up! Please help spread the word about Daytrader so we can hit our stretch goal and make briefcase pawns happen! \n\n\nConcept for the Briefcase Pawns \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - Become a backer. For only $32 you can grab your own copy and help us get one step closer to the goal!   2 - Share. Click on the facebook button under the video above or follow (and share) the link below to help us create greater awareness.\n\nhttp://playdaytrader.com/share    3 - Play it. We realize you can do this one quite yet, but we're working really hard to get this game out to you as soon as possible which is why we'd love for you to be part of the process! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of Daytrader hit me one day two years ago when I was looking at a few stocks online. The stocks in question had just gone through a very volatile week. They started off at a relatively low price only to soar up to around 30-50% in 2 days. The very next day, they plummeted right back to where they started. I thought what an interesting game this is, if it were only that. The light bulb went on, someone should make this into a simple game which could be educational and fun, but without real risk. So I began the quest of making Daytrader. I feel there is a lack of  practical economic education in our school systems. I believe a game like this will benefit many high school students preparing for college and life, as well as, adults much like myself that seek more knowledge of the basics of investing.  It also serves to fill the void many expert investors may have with the lack of choices modern board games offer. I've spent a lot of time making sure that Daytrader has a simple enough mechanic to allow anyone from 13 to 99, musician to businessman, 99% to the 1% to participate, laugh and maybe even learn something. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we meet our funding goal we'll start working on a website designed specifically to order your rewards. Once the reward code we give you has been entered on the site to receive your rewards, you can choose any shipping option that works best for you and you will pay the shipping cost at that time, instead of what could be an over priced flat fee now. Domestic costs for ground shipping (within the US) may range from $5 - $15. You will have one year from the day the reward site goes live to place your rewards order. We will notify you before the site goes live and a few updates during to remind you. We're working hard to not only have a shipping station in the US but also in the UK to make any games ordered from within the EU to be at a domestic cost as well. We'll keep you posted! Risks and challenges When it comes to fulfillment, every project has potential obstacles, from production delays to permits to collaborator mishaps. We've spent a good amount of time trying to minimize these events. We hope for the best but always plan for the worse. We will keep everyone completely up to date with all the set backs and successes along the way to make sure no one is kept in the dark about anything. Communication is key.\n\nWe have almost every part of the end process (IE. getting the games and rewards to your door) organized and waiting for funding so we can start manufacturing everything. One aspect of this project that is in debate is which great company to print the boards and boxes with. We have received amazing work from a few great companies and will continue to seek out which company will be the best for us so that we can deliver the best possible final project to you guys no later than November.

As a pediatrician, now retired, I have only rarely made a professional endorsement, but you inspired me and \"Wordwright\" is clearly deserving. I hope you achieve the recognition you deserve. There are many who can benefit from this game.\" - Bennet Rosenthal -- Puzzle player on Facebook   \"I've been playing this game after being picked as a 'beta' teacher! My class loves it (7th grade), my family loves it, my friends love it. Thank you Defined Mind!\" - Middle school teacher in Canada -- Blind playtester \"It's a really pretty game. Vibrant art. Neat, little product. You spend a lot of time thinking about the words you're making -- easy words now versus saving some parts for later.\" - Albert Hernandez and Julius Besser -- Game reviewers (1 player podcast) \"I really like that Rachel and Jay shaped Wordwright in such a way that there is unlimited games that you can play.

And the artwork is really crisp.\" - Brittany and Brady Williams -- Game reviewers (Smarter Backer) \"I enjoyed trying the game out at the Chicago Toy and Game Fair, and I can't express how disappointed I was when I found out I couldn't purchase one of the sets at your table.\" - Elementary school teacher in Illinois -- Playtester \"If you like words and word games this is definitely a good one to have ... it's different from pretty much anything else out there, because you're working with word parts rather than individual letters. Plus, the variety of game options, very small size, and simple theme make this easy to take with just about anywhere and pull out with anyone. It's very convenient, accessible, and provides several game options in one small, great looking package. Wordwright is definitely worth $15 (on Kickstarter, $20 MSRP) for a fun, flexible word game system.\" - George Jaros -- Game reviewer (GJJ Games) Read the comments for more praise for Wordwright from backers like you. Check out a short photo album showing how we made and launched Wordwright. Check out our puzzles on Facebook that relate to individual games. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWordwright is a new way of playing word games, using an old way of building words.  We've carefully curated a collection of word parts (prefixes, roots, and suffixes) that have the main word part, spelling variations and definitions printed on them. Players combine these cards together in different ways to form and reform hundreds of common words. This mimics how the English language evolved and continues to grow.  Bundled together, the cards become the Wordwright Base Kit, which is an elegantly designed pack of cards that you can take anywhere to play a variety of word games -- our game variations and ones you invent. Perfect for solitaire players, couples, families, teachers, casual gamers, Wordwright should have a place in every home. \n\n\nWordwright was pos·it·ive·ly fun for all at the Chicago Toy & Game Fair \n \n\n \n\n\nHow do the cards work? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery card is a word part that has meaning. We print the definitions on one side, which often come from Latin or Greek. The main word part is interchangeable with any of its spelling variations (printed below the main word part). This allows you to use the same card multiple ways to make different words. What games can you play? Update: We've been adding puzzles that relate to individual games on Facebook, and you can check them out here .  We have a ton of game and puzzle variations to compete, collaborate or ponder over, including ones where you quickly spot words in a large group of cards, make words from your hand, or reform communal words. The games are very quick to learn, and sometimes reminiscent of classic games, like our reworking of rummy in Rewrite Rummy. But our unique mechanic brings a depth to word play that we've never seen before in games. We've shown Wordwright to a wide range of people: From kids to seniors, and all ages in between, whether they identify as gamers, puzzlers, teachers, parents, or anything else, there's a game variation for everyone, even those that don't typically like word games. And in the process of having fun, you learn a bit about the English language and etymology. Below is a playlist of a few game variations, but this is by no means exhaustive. We have several variations in the works -- most with complete rules written -- and keep coming up with new ways of playing. However, we often are lacking time to record and edit new game videos. We are aiming to add more videos during the campaign. \n\n\nInstruction manual (early version): Link to PDF (adjust browser width to zoom) Wordwright across the web: Below are various mentions about Wordwright. Preview video from Board Game Brawl: \n\n\n\nPreview video from Cloak & Meeple (with a somber opening):  \n \n\n\n\nArticle about the educational benefits of using Wordwright to teach morphology from Atlanta Reads. \nLonger preview article for gamers from GJJ Games. \n10 minute podcast segment as it applies to single players from 1 Player Podcast (starts at 50 minutes). \nInterview about the game pre-Kickstarter on Smarter Backer (choppy internet). \nSmall snippet for casual gamers. \nShort mention on Dice Tower's Board Game Breakfast . \nMention on GeekDad \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us: Twitter , Facebook \n Notes on general backer involvement and Stretch Goals Beyond backers pledging money in exchange for games and to support Wordwright, we want to involve backers through the whole of the process to help improve the final product. We will have standard stretch goals of improved components for reaching higher goals, but the following are a few noteworthy elements we are aiming to accomplish in our campaign. \n\nWild card design: Mirroring a standard deck of playing cards, each Wordwright deck has 52 word part cards, and two Wild (joker) cards. None of the games require use of the wild cards, but we have a handful of suggestions of how you can use them in existing games to change them up, and it can aid the creation of new games. We will be generating Wild card design options internally, and from backers through a pledge level. The final Wild card design options will be decided in part by voting all backers can participate in. \n\nLonger instruction booklet stretch goals: As Wordwright is a game platform with near limitless game variations, there is a need to cut off the printed instructions at some point, as the instruction booklet is one of the most expensive elements to produce for us. Rules and videos for game variations will be available online, but we will only be able to include a few games in the instruction booklet at the base goal in order to keep prices down. As the campaign gains success, the power of bulk buying will allow for a cheaper cost for additional booklet pages, meaning we can include more game variations in the printed booklet, adding replay value in a self-contained, offline single Wordwright pack. As we approach project goals to increase pages, we will ask backers to vote on which games should make it in. \nWhen certain goals are reached in the campaign, we would like to donate games to educational organizations. We will be asking backers to nominate which organizations they would like to see receive copies of the game, and then possibly vote on those organizations. \n Educator sponsorship You may notice most pledge levels have an option to sponsor/gift a copy of Wordwright for an educator. We designed Wordwright to be first and foremost a collection of fun games and puzzles for anyone. Yes, there is an educational aspect to the game, but there was never an intention for Wordwright to be used solely for an educational purpose. We, as the creators of Wordwright, can't learn much more about words from this game, but we still enjoy playing. They're solid games with a lot of depth, and they continue to challenge our brains to work in a different way than any other game we've played. That said, we have received a significant response from educators (elementary, middle and high school teachers, ESL teachers, and more) that have been in need of a product like ours to engage students in English language learning. Many of these educators have expressed that they do not have much of a budget, and they are teaching disadvantaged populations. We grew up without much money, but are better off today because we received a good education, so we have an interest in helping other disadvantaged people get a better education, too. If our game can help people who don't have the resources to purchase it themselves, we want to figure out a solution to that problem. We're taking a small gamble that the Kickstarter community will want to support these educators, too, by providing an opportunity to sponsor an educator. Additionally, if we hit certain goals in growing this campaign, we pledge to donate several games to organizations backers nominate and vote on. However, there is no obligation that a backer must sponsor a game in order to receive one. If you are an educator that wants to sign up for an opportunity to receive a copy, please fill out this form to register: http://bit.ly/WordwrightForTeachers In the unlikely scenario that there are more copies sponsored than teachers requesting copies, we will donate the sponsored copies to educational organizations voted on by backers. If you are part of an educational organization that would like to be considered, email us at info@definedmind.com. Our story A short gallery of how we made and launched Wordwright Hi, we're a sister and brother from Chicago, raised by educator parents. We are passionate about the engaging qualities of gaming and the equalizing benefits of education, and have an idea for a gaming company that helps people empower themselves. Wordwright is hopefully the first of several games that will help people unlock different doors of knowledge. We chose the linguistics genre first, as language is the secret key to communicating pretty much all other knowledge. The idea for Wordwright is decades in the making. Rachel learned to read at the age of three, and advanced her literacy rapidly thereafter by using word part meaning as a short-cut to literacy. Once you can read and figure out the tricks to understanding words quickly, all other knowledge comes easier. She wanted to make a game out of this concept, but needed help to develop it, so she asked her brother. Since both of us have a background in software, the obvious answer was to make a mobile app using the general word part concept. Over the course of a couple months of late nights turning wireframes into functioning code, we made a fully playable prototype. One major problem: It wasn't much fun. Still, the concept was a good one. Jay, a lifelong card player, suggested a better way of making the game might be to treat it as a card game platform, where inside an elegant pack you could take anywhere, you had a variety of games you could play. And keeping the deck minimal had the additional benefit of keeping the cost affordable for pretty much anyone. The idea for the final product was born, but it still took several more months to refine the game to a polished point ready for the Kickstarter audience.  We are very proud of Wordwright. It's a great product that is fun and educational for those still learning the language, and is rich and thought provoking to those familiar with it. The ability to make hundreds of common words across unique mechanics allows a level playing field between word game aficionados and those that usually don't enjoy the genre. With a lot of game variations, Wordwright becomes infinitely replayable. We've played the games more times than any sane person might want to in the past few months, and they continue to be engaging, enjoyable and challenging. We still spot new moves in games we've played a hundred times, and continue to think up new games to play with these cards. When you get your copy, you'll see how versatile these cards are. In our most idealistic dreams, we hope Wordwright can be the Legos or Minecraft of word building. Our big goal with this Kickstarter is: Get Wordwright into the hands of as many people as possible. Our ways of tackling that are:  \nMake the best product we can \nMake it at an affordable cost \nCreate a conservative goal \nProvide opportunities to the Kickstarter community to sponsor games for educators and organizations to benefit disadvantaged people \n We've done our part -- we've invested a lot of our own money, and countless hours of our time to get Wordwright where it is. If you like what you've seen, please back our Kickstarter. And please let others know, too. Risks and challenges This is our first Kickstarter – that’s a challenge in and of itself, but we have confidence that we are prepared. We have a simple-to-manufacture product with calculated costs. Our design is complete, minus swapping in some art based on how the campaign develops. We have had a promotional version run from our manufacturer (who has been in the card printing business for decades), and we were very happy with both the quality of the cards, and the speed of production and delivery.\n\nThat being said, there are still a few potential risks:\n\n1) Manufacturing issues. If somehow our manufacturer fails us, we will address it straight-away to ensure that we get a quality product to our backers as soon as possible.\n\n2) Shipping delays. The level of success for this campaign is an unknown. If Wordwright becomes wildly successful with a large number of backers, fulfilling all order at the same time could become an issue. We will communicate that to our backers as soon as we realize it's a possibility. However, we are confident we can work with partners to ensure that all backers receive their rewards in a timely fashion.\n\n3) The unknown. Again, this is our first Kickstarter, but our goal is for this to be the first of many. We want to make sure to leave a good first impression. We will do everything in our power to ensure that, addressing any issues as they arise. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Things removed for reasons! \nEDIT: FULLY FUNDED as of 9/25/2012 \n Now that I am fully funded, I wanted to throw up some brainstorm excitements so that you can start anticipating this game a few months out from its actual release. I need to see those gossip columns rumbling, people. Will there be a Girlfriend Mode? Nope! Will I take a radical stance on the War in Afghanistan? Nope to that too!  The Final Game, or Thanks For The Money\n There is very little of Funeral that actually exists at this point. I have figured out how to make four-directional movement work with minimal stress. Here are some of the things that will be added between now and release.\nAbsolute Lack of Customization: You don't get to choose your main character. It is a lot of time out of my life to create multiple main character sprites, and to be honest, I have no idea how I would create a character selection screen. It just isn't going to happen.\nSome NPCs: It is a lot of work to create unique NPCs. There might be, like, two in the final game. Old Baldy McWhiteguy and Nice Woman of Indeterminate Ethnic Origin.\nParty Development: Five minute RPGs don't really have time for party development. There will probably be a mechanic where your \"ability to hold yourself together because of extreme sadness\" meter goes down in small but noticable increments.\nAn Ending: The game might just crash Chrome at the end.\nIncredibly Deep Meta Game: Multiple endings. Your choices really matter. Visceral combat. Realistic romance options, but only for cis straight white men. You're telling me you were mean to a potted plant in the opening cinematic when the QTE kicked in? You can't get the best ending.\nSoundtrack: There will be one long, droning sound that serves as a soundtrack. I will probably record other things, too, like the dishwasher and some cats purring. END OF EDIT You might know me from things that I write on this cage is worms . You might not know me if you don't know me from there, which is fine.  I am running this Kickstarter to fund a game that I am, tentatively, calling Funeral . The basic concept of the game is that it will be a five to ten minute RPG about going to a funeral. It is patterned off of the opening of Dragon Warrior , a game that I last played like twenty years ago. But I have fond memories. What is the $200 for? Time, mostly. Having to make a product because someone gave me money for it is a prime motivating factor. More than that, the $200 pays for late-night coffee. It is also an amazing excuse for working on the project--when I am invited out or expected to participate in social activities, I will say \"Sorry chaps, I owe a game to some consumers!\" So when I say that I would like $200 to make Funeral , what I am saying is that this Kickstarter is going to be used to push Funeral out in a timely manner. It is going to fund the development of the project and subsidize the things I do in my life during the development time. You should look at the Rewards to get a better sense of what each tier means, but I am going to be open with you: I am going to make this game and release it for free. Much like my previous games, Or, What Is It Like To Be A Thing? and Smash The Patriarchy! , I am going to put it on the internet, point people to it, and let it wallow in obscurity after an initial push of 100 plays or so. I think that is pretty awesome. The reward tiers are there so that people who want extra things can pay for them. So the game will be made anyway. It will be free, no matter what. However, if this kickstarter makes, it will be created and released at a slightly faster pace. The game is going to be made in Construct 2 , a game making program that exports things to HTML5. I bought the bloody license for it, so I am going to use it. Music will be made by me (it will be terrible). Art will be made by me (it will not be pretty). What will the game be like? It we be like the first five to ten minutes of Dragon Warrior , I told you already. But, hopefully, it will also use the simple game mechanics of early RPGs to thing about loss and how normative ways of dealing with grief are forced on people.  I think this is a moment where I am supposed to list off influences. That isn't to say that my game will be like the games that these people make, but that I think that these people are doing it right somehow: Merrit Kopas , Anna Anthropy , Increpare . I can't think of any other people right now. I am not slighting you. I think you're great, I promise. Look at this OutSlide that I made to illustrate my visions and dreams.

    "textDescription": "Story What's this all about? I'm just beginning a series of work involving the crumbling store fronts in the northern Pittsburgh burbs. I moved here about 6 months ago, and ever since my first drives through the derelict main streets of ex-steel or aluminum towns, I've been fascinated by the state of decay and of the creative re-use of old buildings. A once fabulous theatre became a bingo hall, which in turn shut its doors. You can rent a lovely art deco ex-jewelry store for any event, but nobody has in years. There are long defunct stores that when peered into, you can see old stock still on the shelves, and chipped paint and plaster fall on the carefully arranged displays never removed from the windows. Along the way, individual stores have been built, destroyed, re-facaded, and what you're left with are ghost towns of incongruous buildings or vacant lots. So explain your paintings to me. This series, which I'm calling 'Store Facades' (the facade being, in fact, that they are stores at all) harkens a bit to my past body of work, which dealt with the figure, the throw-away object (like souvenirs no one asked for, but have been kept for 50+ years regardless), and how those two ideas relate. Walking in a downtown that has wheezed off the map long ago is surreal; you're somewhere that isn't quite gone, but no longer exists. You're looking through windows, past the dust, and into retail oblivion. Until you add the paint, that is. I'm painting what I would want to see in these stores. What if I made a shop display, and left it alone for 30 years? Who are my shoppers? What would my stores sell? How does a place, built by humans for humans, no longer serve them? How can a beautiful old building, made with marble and brass, show a different beauty through dust and dereliction? \n\n\nStore Front, 2012, Oil on Canvas, 44x48\" \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nJewelry Store, oil on canvas, 2012, 48x24\" \n \n\n \n\n\n\nShopper, Oil on Linen, 2013, 36x24\" \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\"Step\" oil on board, 2013, 48x24\" \n \n\n \n\nAnd who are you? I'm Alessandra Sulpy , hi! I'm what they call an emerging artist, and I've spent the past few years bouncing around the country teaching drawing and painting at various universities. I've shown my work nationwide in juried and solo shows, and been lucky enough to have the time to work, work, work. My husband and I are planning a move in another 6 months (to some unknown location, as we migrate to where the jobs are), and will be leaving Pittsburgh and its fascinating stores behind. Before the end of summer, I want \"Store Facades\" to be a fully-fleshed out body of work. What will my $$ do, exactly? For months now, I have been working with iridescent, brightly pigmented, or fluorescent paints to intensify the glitz of my paintings. What I'd love to use, but cannot currently afford, are things like gold leaf, high-quality (and hopefully less fugitive) fluorescent paints and pigments, and metallic foils. There are colors I currently must use sparingly because of their cost, and I've been looking into custom-made laser-cut painting surfaces. The vast majority of the money for this project will go to supplies, and to hire a model. The rest of the money will go into the costs of putting together a show package to send to prospective galleries, and get these babies into the public eye! Risks and challenges Short of my being hit by a bus tomorrow, the series will go forth and be made. What I need your help with is the resources to make this series BETTER. I want to make paintings that (figuratively) mix gold and dust, and right now all I've got is the dust.\nAnything you purchase or commission will be in your possession by the end of summer. If you're buying a painting from the series, there is a chance it's been entered in an art show and you might have to wait for its return from the show to be shipped to you.

    "textDescription": "Story Thank you for visiting our Kickstarter page for Trackside. Trackside is an independent feature length documentary film produced by Soft-Focus Productions. It will follow several track marshals in Motorsport.\n\nWe will follow several Motorsport marshals in the UK. Without marshals Motorsport literally could not happen. These men and women volunteer week in and week out, putting themselves at the centre of the action and risking their lives to keep this sport alive. \nFrom Formula 1 to Rally, Moto GP to the Isle of Man TT, our marshals in orange are present at every race. We learn about the vast array of different roles and jobs that fall upon the marshals every race weekend, as well as following several marshals who work at a range of tracks across the country. We will also interview some of the world's best drivers who will tell their fascinating stories involving marshals. Following the likes of Senna and Rush, Trackside gives audiences a view into the world of Motorsport as close to the action as its possible to get. We already have several marshals who have agreed to be in the film as well as agreed interviews with several high profile racing drivers. We will tell the stories of several marshals including Steve Tarrant, who lost his leg while marshalling at Goodwood in 2000. With your support we can really push forward with this film and tell the gripping story of  what it's like to be Trackside. Initially we will be showing the film at various film festivals around the world followed by a release on DVD & Blu-ray. Who are Soft-Focus Productions? We are a professional production company that have been producing documentaries, short films and promotional videos for a number of years. We have worked with some national and international names including NBA, NHS & BMW Mini, as well as winning a few awards along the way! Where will my money go? \n\n\n\n\n\nRewards Starting with access to our exclusive production blog, which gives you exclusive access to behind the scenes footage and extended interviews, as well as the chance to interact with the team behind Trackside. We also have a range of official Trackside merchandise including our own Trackside badges to help show your support to the marshals as well Trackside baseball caps. We also have a range of signed merchandise which has been generously donated by some of the biggest names in Motorsport. NEW REWARDS FROM TOYOTA HYBRID ADDED \n\n\n\n\n\nRewards \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges With many years of experience in production as well as a highly talented team of individuals we will be able to address any production issue which may arise. These may range from issues with cameras, in which case we will always have spares and backups. To problems with interviews such, where we will always have other dates ready booked in the calendar.

As many of you know, I have been working digital and designing a bunch of pop culture prints, each one of those prints were released in a limited edition and many are no longer available. I'm also a art book Junkie, I love em'. Even with today's digital Social world, I still buy art books.. There is something to me that is awesome to see a persons creative journey. This lead me to thinking it was time to have a nice art book. Earlier this year I self financed a small version of what I'm planning on doing with this project. The book sold out in a few short months, and my skills in Photoshop and art in general have improved ( at least I think they have). Since then, there is so much more stuff I want to show the world. So this time around, I'm increasing the book size to 48 or more pages. Since my first kickstarter project, I learned so much about how this \nprogram works, and have gotten a better grasp on things. I wanted to \noffer some new rewards this time around, I got something for everybody's\n budget. I have chosen Ka-Blam to do the printing on this book, and have a sold budget in mind for all the cost including shipping and the reward cost. So the return time will not be as long to send out rewards like it was for the Toy.  I'm super excited about the rewards, and feel they are some of the coolest I have done. So please take a minute to read over them and hopefully back me on this book. As always, I thank each one of you everyday for helping me live my dreams and I know in all my heart, I'm a lucky fellow, who is surrounded by amazing people. If you have any questions about this book or my art, please reach out to me.

The child wore miniature designer blue jeans plus a pink button down shirt with an insignia on the chest informing all educated consumers, This little shirt cost a lot of bucks . He had the laidback look of a civilized prep star—and I’m sure he had a huge IQ—but he was wild on the inside, my kind of child.”   “Some Freaky Girl Some Freaky Winter:”  Filled with sexual tension and love’s sudden transformations, “Some Freaky Girl Some Freaky Winter” pulls Whitey (now in his thirties and bitching about his injuries) into the stormy bedroom of a damaged teenager who holds up a mirror to a national epidemic, becoming an unexpected spiritual teacher:   “Lots of black in the eyelashes. Lots of pale in the cheeks. She was punk or goth; it was hard to tell which. The hair was orange and black and purple and green. She looked like Halloween on hallucinogens. And she had the boots, the big black boots.”   “The Lady with the Blue Piano:”   Weeks after the death of her grandson in the attacks of 9/11, Ruthie Greenberg, a senile old woman who's “losing most of her things and being put into a nursing home” doesn't even know she's moving. Her plight inspires her middle-aged Whitey and his partner Bobby Mountain to defy their greedy boss, rip up the bill, chuck it down a sewer, and throw their customer a tea-and-cookie party before moving her stuff for free. But it's the old woman's final piano concert that steals the show, bringing these two hardened moving men to touch a kind of love which has no gender, race, or age.  “Though she had put up a persuasive fight at first, insisting arthritis had twisted her fingers beyond redemption, The Mountain had charmed her into giving us the concert:\n“Baby, you can’t do the boys like that. Say you’re a great pianist and then not play. Come on, girl. You got to go all the way now. You give us a piece of that sweet music.”   The Love Poems:  Written by a furniture mover with a master's degree, these poems are as clear as water and fearless in their expression of the love a man feels for a woman. From possessive animal passion to slapstick infatuation to the tenderness of maturity and the union of spiritual transcendence, these ten love poems explore the human heart in all its wildness and stillness.   Here's an example, the first page of the book:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges Phil sees no obstacles to this project's successful completion.

    "textDescription": "Story Stretch Goals added at the bottom! \n\n\n$2,000 stretch goal \n \n\n \nMy name is David LaRocca and I’m a full-time freelance Illustrator. Creating art has been my passion since I was a small child. I set a goal many years ago to make my living as an illustrator and reaching that goal has been an experience that can’t be described in words. I absolutely love working for clients and I greatly appreciate them trusting me with their projects. That said; I also want to create as many personal pieces as I can. That is where Project Star Spawn comes in!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Project Star Spawn all about? Star Spawn is the name of a digital painting I’m currently working on. It is one in a series of H.P. Lovecraft inspired paintings I've created. \n\n\nH.P. Lovecraft (1890 – 1937) though virtually unknown to the average person his influence has had a massive impact on modern day science fiction and horror. He is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. \n \n\n \n\n\nSpecifically a \"Star Spawn\" is a spawn of the Great Old One, Cthulhu. They are visually similar to one another but Cthulhu is much larger.   What will the painting look like you ask?  [EDIT: 10/13] Due to the quick funding of this project I have been able to focus on Star Spawn day and night. The painting is now complete! All additional funding from the campaign will allow me to explore new ideas! Here is the final version of the Star Spawn painting: \n\n\nStar Spawn - Final Painting \n \n\n \n\n\nThis is what painting looked like as of 10/01/15: \n\n\nProgress as of 10/1/15 \n \n\n \n\n\n Here is what the painting looked like at the launch of the Kickstarter: \n\n\nThe unfinished Star Spawn painting at launch \n \n\n \n\n\n[EDIT 10/01]Since the Kickstarter was funded so quickly it allowed me to go ahead and bump the painting up to the top of my priority list! Now I am full steam ahead and plan to have it completed BEFORE the campaign end date!  Award winning art director, my friend and mentor Jon Schindehette will be art directing Star Spawn . You may know his work from his time as the Senior Creative Director at Wizards of the Coast (Dungeons & Dragons, etc.) and currently ThinkGeek Solutions. It is truly amazing to have his knowledge and experience on board with the project. Why I need your help and what you get in return:  Without this Kickstarter I need to seek out new paying client work as my top priority. I have to support my wonderful family somehow right? That forces Star Spawn to the bottom of my list of things I’m able to work on. I think there are enough fans of Lovecraftian art, fantasy art, etc. that could help make Star Spawn my top priority. If you want to directly support my art then here is your chance and you’ll be getting some great stuff in return!! [EDIT] Stretch Goals have been added at the bottom!!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI take pride in the quality of my prints. I spend a lot of time on my art and the prints have to accurately replicate the paintings. These are printed on thick high gloss paper and they really look great. Suitable for framing.  If you choose a reward that includes a print I'll contact you to see which one you would like. All prints are 11\" x 17\" and some have a white border. Each print is signed with a silver felt marker. Here's what is available: \n\n\n\nStar Spawn \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Haunter in the Deep \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Doom of Innsmouth (Lovecraft eZine #35 cover) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nH.P.

Choose this!) \n \n\n \n\n\n Special offer! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n *Get a free 8 x 12\" signed print of Third Eye by David LaRocca and a 8 x 12\" signed print of Nautilus by Valerie Herron when you back David LaRocca: Star Spawn at the Signed Print level or higher AND The Book of Starry Wisdom at Cultist level or higher. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are high quality playmats that measure 24\" x 14\".  Excellent for use in gaming, computer desks, etc. These mats are professionally printed with excellent color range and deep blacks. These can come signed at no additional charge. \n\n\n\nStar Spawn (Playmat will feature the finished painting) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Haunter in the Deep \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChampion of Light \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\" x 9\" Original Painting \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\" x 18\" Original Drawing #1 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n12\" x 18\" Final Drawing \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n12\" x 18\" Original H.P.

It will time consuming and a lot of work but this is what I do for a living and I'm 100% positive it will get done.\n\nPrinting is also something I already do a lot of. I attend many events that I sell my artwork at so I have the printing process down already. I use a printing company that I trust and the turn around time is very fast.\n\nPlaymats are a new item for me but I have seen many mats from the company I am using and they all look great. I have full confidence that my art will look awesome on these mats. The order can take a while to come in but I have been assured that if this project is funded that I can receive the mats within a reasonable time frame.\n\nShipping is honestly my biggest concern. I haven't shipped a lot of items internationally. In the past my international orders were all handled by a company that is \"print on demand\". For this project I will ship everything. All shipping costs have been ESTIMATED and the final cost will be all that is charged. I believe I have overestimated shipping in most cases so I hope that it will be cheaper for you in the end.

Project U-Neek is a new collective of emerging visual artists who have united to exhibit and sell their art work and offer their collective ingenuity to enhance and revitalise local businesses.The project was set up to expose artists to new audiences for their work, and help unlikely audiences to have new artistic experiences by placing artwork in 'U Neek' locations such as small businesses, e.g. cafes, restaurants, offices, community centres and care homes etc.How does it work? The Project U-Neek collective have a large bank of high quality art work available to exhibit in various locations. 1.    The Project U-Neek team meet the owners of businesses to ensure that artworks are placed in locations that are well suited to their style and content with a view to compliment the interiors and enhance the atmosphere.2.    The artwork is installed for an agreed period of time.3.    A small launch party is hosted with a few selected guests.4.    The exhibits are advertised on project U-Neek website and social media for the general public to go and see.5.    Artwork is available for sale or rent during the exhibition period.Phase 1 of Project U-Neek will officially launch April 2013 in Birmingham, West Midlands with future plans expand to other regions in the UK and beyond. Who is involved? Project U-Neek is an initiative led by Art by Alexandria, Alexandria Robinson-Sutherland an emerging commercial artist with Interior Design and Architectural knowledge and experience.Alexandria identified this opportunity after hosting her own exhibition launch in May 2012 and saw the opportunity to help develop other emerging artists while developing building her own profile and developing her business.Alexandria is very well networked and has spent several months engaging with a wide range of creative people gauging interest from over 100 visual artists. Through Project U-Neek, Alexandria works with these artists primarily on their profile building and the commercial development of their artwork.Businesses and Project U-Neek Project U-Neek is designed to promote local artists and local businesses. Helping them engage with potential new customers as well as people in the local community. Various elements of the project provide unique promotional opportunities.By hosting a Project U-Neek exhibit you could benefit in the following ways:•    Bespoke Interior enhancement guaranteed to compliment your business and catch the attention of your customers •    Attract a young, vibrant creative community – Those following project U-Neek will be people interested in art and culture and will subsequently be drawn in and discover your organization.•    Free Advertising through Social Media – Your business will be recognised on our website and publicity materials.•    Opportunity to achieve any Corporate Social Responsibility objectives you may have. The project is an opportunity for you to give back by supporting local artists and working with your local community. Risks and challenges I have scarified a lot to pursue this endeavor. Some of the challenges that I could face are extra demands on my time. Ensuring that all artworks are installed on time, all graphics/publications are designed and printed correctly and on time. \n\nThis project also relies heavily on the participation of visual artist and businesses. So if a business or visual artist were to pull out at last minute then this would also present the project with a challenge.\n\nAdditional risks are not being funded. This project really relies on your support as it will help cover equipment, transportation, installation and additional promotional costs. We really need at least £4,000 in order for this project to be the great success that it has the potential to be.\n\nA successfully funded Kickstarter campaign will be exceptionally beneficial in establishing strong relations with both artist and business, thus building their trust with Project U-Neek.

La tragicita si alterma a lunghi silenzi di sospensione, poi a battute di spiazzante ironia e infine a urla disperate, it tutto in un ascendente ritmo che procede verso il climax e un imprevedibile finale\" (Fuori Le Mura) \nLa prima nazionale del Corragio di Adele e' avvenuta a Roma, 8 Marzo 2012 al Teatro Piccolo Eliseo con grandissimo successo, dai un occhiata su alle recensioni.  \nAbbiamo adesso l opportunita' di portate lo spettacolo nella versione inglese al Festival di Edimburgo:  \n\nAbbiamo scelto una delle migliori sale dove debuttare, the Northbridge Space UK Venue (www.thespaceuk.com) \nAbbiamo gia' fatto un mese di prove ma non e' finita qui, ci aspettano altri 15 giorni in Luglio (amiamo il processo creativo) \nE adesso....ci occorre il tuo aiuto affinché' possiamo mettere insieme la cifra necessaria per coprire le spese (dai un occhiata al budget in fondo alla pagina) \n \nStiamo inoltre lavorando ad un eventuale produzione dello spettacolo a New York per il 2013! \n                              SINOSSI \n\nUna\nstoria d’amore, ambientata in una ipotetica guerra non definita, tra una\ngiovane donna e un giovane uomo che non si sono mai incontrati prima, costretti\na convivere per un breve periodo in una baracca, al freddo, in aperta campagna,\nin attesa che vengano sospesi i bombardamenti e arrivino degli alleati a salvare\nil Paese. È Adele che trova Lucas ferito e ammalato e decide così di prendersi\ncura di lui. Rischiando ogni giorno la vita, va a prendere del cibo in un\nlontano casolare il cui proprietario è un misterioso contadino. Nell’isolamento\ne nel pericolo di morte continuo, Lucas e Adele si trasformano in un Adamo e\nEva dei nostri tempi: scontri, ricatti, promesse, eros . I personaggi ora sono\nobbligati a fare i conti con il proprio presente e a fantasticare su un incerto\nfuturo. Una verità nascosta da Adele e un’azione folle di Lucas cambieranno i\nloro destini per sempre.  \nBrevi scene, dialoghi serrati, silenzi, sguardi; la\ntragicità del testo si confonde con la sottile ironia dei due attori che si\ncercano ma non si trovano, a pochi metri di distanza. \n\n                            CHI SIAMO? \n\nSunflower theatre company e’ una nuova\ncompagnia creata da Katarina Morhacova, Giampiero Rappa e Gaetano Sciortino con\nl obbiettivo di produrre e portare lo spettacolo”Il Coraggio di Adele”in tutti\nI paesi con l uso della lingua inglese.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Kickstarter! We are excited to launch and share our first product - the ODIN - with the Kickstarter community. With your help, we will produce the first Android 'Smart' projector that directly projects online content from a compact, battery-operated device allowing sharing and viewing in unlimited ways. We are thrilled with ODIN and we think you will be too. We hope you will support our campaign with contributions and by spreading the word to your community! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT CAN I DO WITH ODIN? ODIN is the ideal product for people who consume most of their entertainment using Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, the web and mobile applications. As we consume more information via the Internet, we need a compact, portable device that gives us a large visual display.   \nStream movies from Netflix and Hulu \nAccess files from Dropbox or Skydrive \nSurf the web on a Chrome browser \nUse Google Docs and Office 365 to work by connecting a keyboard and mouse \nPlay Xbox on a big screen \nStream music from your phone to the Bluetooth speakers \nExpress your creativity in new ways - use as a guide to paint a mural, in an art display, and more \n These are just some of the activities you can accomplish with ODIN. We are sure that you will think of thousands of other ways. \n\n\nStream and beam Netflix in your living room via ODIN's WiFi. Access to over 1 million apps on the Android ecosystem gives you endless options for online content. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the web or work in Google Docs or Office 365 by connecting a keyboard and mouse (via Bluetooth or USB). Also connect to Dropbox, Google Drive, and other business productivity applications. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMovie night with grandma at the hospital? Easy. Beam Hulu onto a wall and enjoy entertainment in the most unexpected places. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConnect ODIN to an Xbox or/ Playstation and experience game-play in completely new ways. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate new uses that suit your interests and lifestyle. \n \n\n \n\n\nDOS OWLS STORY Sometimes when a problem offers no apparent answers, the only solution is to radically alter the operating parameters. After being continuously frustrated with paying for cable service I wasn’t using, I decided to make the bold move to cancel my subscription. I was getting all my news and entertainment via the Internet and my mobile phone – watching cable shows on my television was something I rarely did. Even though my new arrangement was liberating and financially empowering, I soon noticed that I missed the enjoyment of sitting back in my living room and catching a movie on a widescreen television. I decided to venture out and find a device that would meet my needs. I wanted a product that could handle all my viewing apps (Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.). To my dismay, the only way I could achieve what I desired was hooking up my computer to a bulky projector (prone to inconvenient overheating) and separate, external speakers. Long story short, that search morphed into the initial idea for the creation of Dos Owls – a multi-functional, portable visual display that solves a slew of A/V problems and opens the door to a limitless universe of content sharing possibilities. It’s battery-powered, wireless (WiFi and Bluetooth), compact and connects effortlessly with the Internet. Necessity sparked invention and I haven’t looked back since. - Alex Yoo, Founder HOW DOES ODIN WORK?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nODIN combines an Android powered PC, state-of-the-art projector, Bluetooth speakers and WiFi in a compact, portable gadget. It is battery operated and can meet the demands of today's digital consumers and creators who value mobility and freedom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptical Display Contains state-of-the-art DMD optical technology that beams powerful LED light and a large screen size.  \nPlace ODIN 1 yard away from the\nwall, and it displays a 25” screen size \nPlace it 10 yards away for a 250\" screen size. \n ODIN's optical lens is so strong, you can see the projected screen with \nnormal indoor lighting at up to 45\" screen size, which is bigger than \nmost flat screen TVs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANDROID KITKAT OS Our intuitive user interface allows for simple navigation and\norganization of all your apps. ODIN uses\na quad-core Android microprocessor and KitKat operating system, which provides access to over 1 million Android apps.   \n\n\nHome Page - Preliminary \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSettings Page - Preliminary \n \n\n \n\n\nCONNECTIVITY ODIN includes array of connection methods. Built in WiFi wirelessly connects to the\nInternet as well as a phone’s hotspot. Embedded Bluetooth allows for easy communication between external\nBluetooth speakers, keyboard, mouse, and other accessories. ODIN has an HDMI port to connect to Xbox or Playstation, two USB drives \nfor a keyboard, mouse, or flash drives, and a headphone plug. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLUETOOTH SPEAKERS ODIN has two play modes: \nA. Full projector mode using the projector, speakers and access to Android apps \nB. Bluetooth speaker mode for streaming music from your phone directly to the two speakers   \n\n\nODIN sports two 4-watt Bluetooth speakers (to compare, iPhone 5 has one 0.8 watt speaker). \n \n\n \n\n\nBATTERY ODIN's battery provides about 2 hours of run-time in portable mode. For extended viewing and charging, just connect ODIN to an outlet with the included power cord.  FUNCTIONAL DESIGN ODIN is designed with flexibility in mind. Beam onto a wall, or rotate the head 90 degrees and display content \non the ceiling for a truly unique viewing experience. (Patent Pending ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n COMPACT SIZE ODIN is lightweight and similarly sized to a typical paperback\nbook. It can be easily carried in your\nbriefcase, tote bag or jacket pocket for portability. It is 6\" long, 4.25\" wide, 1.8\" thick, and weighs 1.7 pounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODAY'S PROJECTOR SYSTEM We think pictures do a much better job than any text. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIVE DEMO Video below is a live demo during TechCrunch Disrupt. \n\n\nINSPIRING CREATIVITY There are many artistic and creative uses for ODIN. For example, use it to create murals and other wall art, as part of an interactive art display, or as a backdrop to a party. \n\n\nDOS OWLS TEAM ALEX YOO BIO - FOUNDER Originally from the suburbs of \nChicago and currently residing in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Alex Yoo earned \nhis first professional experience in the fast-paced financial world of \nWall Street. For five years, he plied his trade diligently at Houlihan \nLokey, Nomura Securities and Tri Artisan Partners. However, he \nsoon grew restless with the repetitive PowerPoint presentations and \nExcel sheets, so he decided to make a change. His next venture came \nabout as a matter of necessity. A habitual sharp dresser, he’d always \nhad difficulty finding dress shirts that worked for his body frame. He \ntook a bold risk and launched an online custom shirt company called \nAlexander West. He poured all his energy and resources into the \nbusiness, and Alexander West is presently an established player in the \nNYC custom clothing market. Alex’s newest project is a tech \nventure called Dos Owls. The idea stemmed from a desire to enjoy his \nNetFlix/Hulu content on a more compact, multi-functional device. The \nfirst Dos Owls product is called ODIN, and it has several distinct \nfeatures including an Android processor, portable theater-like viewing, \nwireless connectivity, exceptional sound output and innovative design.

Since I did not come\nfrom a technology / engineering background, I had to teach my self the basics of mechanical, industrial, optical, and electrical engineering in addition to design for manufacturing and software development (firmware/OS/application).  First, I attended as many hardware workshops as possible (e.g., Hardware Innovation Workshop by MAKE and Hardware Workshop organized by Marc Barros) and talked to anyone that was in hardware technology development as well as a lot of relevant reading. I also started attending relevant Meetup groups around the NYC area and joined Hack Manhattan hackerspace to hang around technology enthusiasts and makers. \n\nThe\nbiggest development hurdle in the beginning was finding skilled and experienced\nengineers who could develop ODIN in addition to being economically feasible.  Due to limited resources, I looked to Asia. With\npersistence, patience and many trips to Asia, I created connections to talented and experienced Chinese engineers and manufacturers. Shezhen, China has an amazing infrastructure of experienced engineers and electronic production facilities that can't be compared to anywhere in the world. Our first prototype, based on a dual-core microprocessor, failed to \nmeet our high expectations for performance and user experience. Therefore, we are currently upgrading all of our hardware specifications (to quad-core, more RAM, Bluetooth 4.0, among others) to have robust performance using Andorid 4.4 KitKat operating system.  ODIN Product Specifications \n\n\nClick to see more pictures. \n \n\n \n\n\n PLEASE NOTE THAT FINAL SPECIFICATIONS CAN CHANGE.  ALL OF OUR REFINEMENTS WILL BE TO IMPROVE THE DEVICE.

We've identified and outlined the following key risks to our project below:\n\n1. RISK DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THE INJECTION MOLD / TOOLING:\n\nInjection molding can often delay hardware production. We're fortunate that our industrial designer and mechanical engineer have extensive Design for Manufacturing experience. In addition, we have extensive relationship with several high quality tooling firms. \n\n2. RISK DUE TO EXCESS DEMAND:\n\nWe are fortunate to have an experienced production team in Shenzhen, China. It will be easier to produce ODIN with higher quantity, because a lot of components and parts come in bulk packages. Our capacity is not an issue until we reach over 50,000 units. \n\nWe could experience shipping bottlenecks once we receive the shipment from factory. Since we will have about 5 to 6 months of advance notice before shipping, we will set up the necessary shipping infrastructure beforehand.\n\n3. RISK DUE TO COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:\n\nOur production team has long-standing relationships with suppliers. In addition, we have a very robust supply chain for components and all the components are readily available in Shenzhen. Only component that could face shortage is the DMD optical engine but we don't see this as a problem with less than 100,000 unit production.

    "textDescription": "Story What's so special about 42? Every year I do 42 sketches starting on January 1. I draw a sketch a night and post it online for my friends to enjoy. Why 42 days? That's six weeks, which is what they say it takes to start a habit. The flurry of sketching jump starts my creativity, resharpens and improves my skills and speed, and best of all, it gives me something to share with my friends. \n\n\nOne Egret and a Thousand Cranes \n \n\n \nLucky number seven This is my seventh year doing this, and each year has gotten better. The last couple of years, people have been asking for books, so that's what this is all about. It's a book for you, dear friend, because if you are reading this, it's likely you are one of those people that have followed and encouraged me. Each of your clicks on the like button was a cheer for me. Each comment something I looked forward to in the morning.  Thing is, I didn't want to just make a collection of sketches. Most of you have seen that. When I sit down each night (or super early in the morning when it's been a long day), I turn on an audiobook, or music, and I open to a fresh page, usually with no idea what will be there an hour from the start. I start to draw. I tell myself stories about it. They are little stories. What if the horses in Iceland where really unicorns in hiding? What would a baby bat be doing with a stuff teddy bear? What would a possum superhero do? Each of the sketches this year has a little micro story to go with it. It's nothing fancy, but I've tried to make it fresh and sometimes a little surprising. It's a little bite-sized snack to go with the sketch, and it's a thank you to you, dear friend, for waiting for this time of year and for encouraging me. Seeing your reactions is the best part for me. \n\n\nApples for the Snow Queen \n \n\n \n\nWhere money goes The money will go toward printing the books here in the USA and then packaging and shipping them out. In some cases, some of the rewards have a print option, and the money will go toward that as well. First 42 The first 42 people to order at the book level ($25 and up) get the book(s) personalized to the person of their choosing, and a greeting card of the most popular image. Stretch goals $1500 -- Stickers! I'll make stickers of the most popular image (determined by likes on Facebook, and comments on Flickr). All levels $25 and above will receive this. $1750 -- New drawing on a time lapse video. $2000 -- Video to explain that business with the unicorn. $2250 -- NEW! Award winning author and all around awesome human being Ken Scholes has agreed to write a short story for the book, based on a brand new sketch. If you love epic fantasy, I'd encourage you to check out Scholes's work, starting with Lamentation. Risks and challenges I'm very lucky that as a designer I already have the tools and experience to minimize the challenges to this project. I have inDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. (Man, do I love living in this day and age or what!) The art is already completed, scanned, and placed into the book. Basic design is already done. \n\nWhat remains is finalizing cover concept, and having a friend or two edit the stories. Then it's off to the printer and, once turned around, into the hands of the contributors. \n\nI've timed this project to minimize the risks, though one last challenge remains. Should I be successful, there will be a lot of books and rewards to get out. To solve this I have a ton of awesome friends that I'll hire/bribe/cook for to help me get those out and into your hands.

We have been planning and working on this project for more than 10 months now. However, during this process, our most important deed is to fulfill our promise to our backers and to deliver Air Bonsai until the deadline. To mitigate risks and avoid any problems, we have created a high-quality prototype and have preliminary agreements with our porcelain manufacturers beforehand. \n\nThere is just one issue in our hands, we are limited to export and carry any plants outside of Japan. To solve this matter, we have support from our team members in the United States who will negotiate with regional bonsai and plant makers. We remind you that the bonsai for our prototypes is just an image. The actual plants we will be using to send to you is for example \"matsu\", a pine tree from your country. We will resolve any issues along the way to make sure we deliver to our backers. \n\nWe are 100% ready for this challenge, and confident to deliver Air Bonsai you will be amazed at! We will continue to commit, work hard and keep you well informed through this process.\n\nThank you, Arigatou-gozaimasu.\n\nThe Hoshinchu Team Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

She comes from a conservative background. Circumstances will force her to make tough choices: should she marry the UFO-devotee who fathered her children? Should she use her kids to distribute apocalyptic literature at the mall ? How can she find some meaning in this messy, confused world? \nAs silly as it all sounds--and yes, it is silly--we hope that you'll not only enjoy the songs and get wrapped up in the story, but that by making Beverly's choices you will come to empathize a little bit more with people whose lifestyles seem diametrically opposed to your own. \nWHAT THE MONEY IS FOR\nEvery musician who's ever lived will tell you recording is expensive , even nowadays. By contributing to our campaign, you will help us afford studio time to finish the album itself as well as create an interactive website that will help guide listeners through the experience. \nWe've already begun work on half the tracks, a video to accompany the first three songs is in production by Melinda the Martian (the mastermind of all our awesome animated videos from our last album), and we're working on some other innovative ways listeners can interact with the album's story. \nIt's only been through the help of people like you that we've been able to keep Canadian Invasion alive and see it thrive, so we hope you'll join us in what will prove to be the biggest, and hopefully best, project we've ever undertaken.

Our engineer, Dominick Antifeatro, (an original member of KTTM,) spent the past weekend turning our vocalist and guitarist's cottage into a DIY recording studio. However, a lot of work lies ahead of us and we need your help to achieve the best result possible \n\n\nCasey recording a vocal track in her kitchen \n \n\n \n\n\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN: $4,000 is our goal.

If we were to raise $6,000 or even $10,000! we have plans for that too. At $6,000 we would be able to offer our album on vinyl, commission more KTTM artwork, and order more and different kinds of KTTM merchandise. At $10,000 we would be able to do all that AND to start funding a national tour for next summer which would include travel expenses, making sure we have the necessary equipment, and bringing Dominick along to be our live sound engineer! \n\n\nJeremiah recording Mandolin over a particularly folky track \n \n\n \n\n  Risks and challenges We're very proud and excited about the DIY quality of this album, however, it does present unique challenges. Our biggest challenge being our limited time and resources. The majority of those of us working on this project have other jobs or are currently in school and we have set fairly strict time-tables in which to complete our album. At the same time we are continuing to play shows around New Paltz and in Brooklyn. It's a juggling act but so fun and incredibly rewarding and we are confident that our hard work will pay off.\n\nBut the success of this project is not solely up to us.

During this time we've worked together on film projects, self-penned plays and concepts for books and graphic novels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been a long-term ambition of ours to \ndevelop a picture book for children. Now that we've recently become dads, we are all the more keen to realise this. We both get a \ngreat deal of joy seeing our kids relate to their favourite fictional \ncharacters, which takes us back to all the brilliant books that inspired\n us so much when we were young.

    "textDescription": "Story In February, Airfoil: The Aviation Inspired Twist pen, was successfully funded and raised nearly 10K. But, it wasn't quite finished yet. I had many requests for gel & rollerball ink compatibility. So I invested a lot more into research & pen mechanisms and redesigned the internal structure of Airfoil to accommodate refills that people wanted.  In summary, Airfoil is back except, slimmer, streamlined, silent all metal click pen mechanism imported from Germany, & compatible with several gel & rollerball ink refills.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirfoil is a beautiful unique click pen inspired by engineering in aviation. Crafted from grade 2 titanium, aluminum, nickel, 24K gold, and stainless steel.  \n\n\nWhat did expert pen bloggers think? \n \n\n \n\n\nMy Pen Needs Ink   \"The Airfoil Click came to me with tight tolerances, a smooth finish without being slippery and a really smooth click mechanism.\" Bob, My Pen Needs Ink The Clicky Post  \" I 100% provide a stamp of approval on this pen and I absolutely love just how unique a piece it is.\", \"In addition to receiving this prototype I will also be backing the project.\" Mike Dudek, The Clicky Post The Everyday Commentary   \"For me, this is a no brainer--its damn gorgeous.\" Tony, Everyday Commentary The Pen Addict  \"I'm really impressed with the prototype Grant sent me. If I was forced to pick nits I would like to see the barrel seam connect more flush between the two halves, and the edges on the grip ridges could be softened just a bit, but overall this is a solid product.\" Brad, The Pen Addict. Thanks for the feedback Brad, I will be working on addressing those!  Ed Jelley  \" The pen has some really interesting lines and it is definitely a unique design.\" Ed Jelley, Ed Jelley The Inkdependence   \"likely to please those who want some weight to their writing instruments. It's also manufactured really well, without any gaps or loose parts.\" Mike, The Inkdependence \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirfoil Click, streamlined, aviation inspired, captivating design \n  Airfoil is a beautifully detailed pen inspired by engineering design in aviation. For those who pay attention to the details around them you may notice the ribbing to the framework on planes, the end cap to the engine housing on jets, and the distinct curves and differences in surface area associated with generating lift, hence the name Airfoil. This pen boasts a bold sleek industrial design that will stand out from the crowd. To create each pen requires a complex machining process. Many machining operations on a CNC lathe operate off of two axis. For CNC mills many operations operate on 3. Airfoil Click however, is carefully sculpted from the stock with 4 axis, that's 4 orientations the machine must move the part to carve out the body geometry. Like many components in modern jets, Airfoil requires a complex manufacturing process to create the unique shape while preserving performance. Each pen is assembled by hand, the threads lubricated for a smooth jewelry-like silent assembly, tested, and carefully inspected.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the overall streamlined design, here is a brief highlight of some of the details inspired by aviation design.  \n\n\nForward section resembles the nose cone of fighter jets with three grooves for grip. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBody resembles the \"Airfoil\" geometry of aircraft wings that incorporate Bernoulli's principle to generate lift. In addition, 5 drilled holes mimic weight reduction techniques used in aircraft frames. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAft section of the pen resembles the jet engine housing of the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible with at least 4 different types of popular refills \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOnly the MB and Uniball use the longer spacer, the G2 and Schmidt use the shorter spacer.

Titanium has a distinct color and an unfamiliar heft to it, unlike more common alloys such as stainless and aluminum. You don't see as many titanium products as other metals due to how hard it is to machine (it's kind of like machining stainless, except harder and more deceptive, it doesn't conduct heat well, putting stress on the cutting tool) and the price.

On the other hand, some people know what refill they want and just want to pen ready to go, no loose parts. I will include these options in the survey. The spacer included will be a custom Delrin spacer. The reason I chose Delrin over aluminum is due to its great machinability and its chemical resistant properties. Aluminum might begin to react with the push mechanism over the course of its 100 year life time. Delrin won't, and will keep your pen clean.  \n\n\n\n2 Custom length spacers. Pressed or non-hackable versions will be available in the survey. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nAll spacer options are included in price (free) \n\nOption 1 Default: Non-Hackable for Schmidt and Pilot G2 (Schmidt refill provided). For those who only want to use Schmidt of Pilot G2 refills.  Pressed spacer for Schmidt and Pilot G2 (Default). You want your spacer to stay on your pen and know you want the above refills. No hassles or loose parts, this pen is ready to go and will always be ready to go.  \n\nOption 2: Non-Hackable for Mont Blanc and Uniball Signo 207 (no refill provided): For those who only want to use Mont Blanc and Uniball Signo 207 refills. Pressed spacer for Mont Blanc and Uniball Signo 207. You don't want the Schmidt refill and will replace it with the MB or the 207. You also don't want any loose parts, so you've opted for the pressed spacer option. No hassles or loose parts, this pen is ready to go and will always be ready to go. \n\nOption 3: Hackable (Schmidt refill provided): You like to try different refills, or perhaps aren't sure which refill you want and don't mind swapping parts out to do so. Provided are two spacers with bores loose enough to switch them out. The longer spacer is for the Schmidt and Pilot, the shorter for MB and 207, you decided which refills suits your preference and modify your pen for just that.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly October \n\nSuccessful funding \nSend out surveys \nOrder pen mechanisms, center column tubing, refills, springs, spacer material, & bolts.  \nCollect survey data \nObtain quotes for final production quantity \nPrep pen boxes (left over from my last project) \n \nMid October \n\nMoney is transferred to my account \nBegin production \nLaser cut box inserts \nPen mechanisms, refills, tubing, springs, spacer material, and bolts arrive \nShip out components for plating.  \n \nEarly November \nPlated parts arrive.  \nMid November \n\nMachined parts arrive \nAssemble aluminum & titanium pens & ship out \nShip out remaining titanium stock for eletropolishing. \n \nEarly December \nElectropolished pen parts arrive. Assemble and ship out. Hopefully all in time for the holidays!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in February over a hundred backers made the first version of Airfoil, a twist pen possible. During the campaign I had many people ask me if the pen could take rollerball or gel ink, if it could be thinner, or even a click pen. So I went back to the drawing board and sculpted the material in CAD.  \nOriginally I was just going to make this version of Airfoil, thinner and a click pen. And it would've cost me about $50 each if I made 200 of them. I thought that no matter how beautiful the finish, that enough people would pay $75+ for that.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more manufacturing friendly design was necessary. But how to do that without losing some of the design features of Airfoil? Here's what I did end up doing. Cutting down the number of parts, removing as many threaded holes as possible, designing the parts to be as automation friendly as I could while preserving the design, and taking advantage of commercially available parts. It brought down costs a little bit. And this is what I finished with. Airfoil Click. \n\n\n\nAirfoil Click Design Stage Render \n \n\n \n\n\n The first prototypes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the delivery date set to December when your production plan anticipates shipment around November? There is always a small chance that things don't go to plan, delays can happen. As a result I've just set the anticipated delivery date to December. It also gives me the option to ship via USPS First class if I'm on schedule or USPS Priority if I'm running behind. A deadline with some buffer always creates additional customer delight if backers get their pens early. \nI see limited quantities on everything, why? To be realistic. I'm confident that I can produce around 700 pens by December. I'm not too sure about 1,000+ (I'll be really lucky in the first place if I can hit that) and will probably create new rewards with extended delivery dates. This gives me more control and the ability to meet my goals as accurately stated as possible. \n\nBeing honest about the product:  No one likes bull crap or false advertising. One step that I take to ensure this is to send my pens to reviewers so you can hear from a third party the pros and cons without any filtering from my personal bias. \nNow that I've just mentioned a bit about transparency...where are these made?I wish this was all made in America, except for the German parts, because stuff made in Germany always gets a good rep. I approached 40 machine shops, local, and on the west coast and no one gave me a bid. Most of them didn't respond, and the reason is I'm a bit of an ambiguous customer, most work with people face to face or with established companies. I'm stuck in the middle of the Pacific. The other reason is making these type of complex pens is a pain in the butt and they can't charge the higher prices like they can with actual industrial parts. So I turned to Alibaba and received some bids from machine shops in Shenzhen within 24 hours. Anyhow, here is the breakdown.  \n\nPen body: China \nSchmidt SCR 888 rollerball ink: Germany \nPush mechanism: Germany \nBolts: USA \nBox: China & USA \nSpring: Purchased in the USA \nCenter column: USA \nNickel & 24K gold plating: USA \nAssembly, testing, shipping: My house in the USA \nCustom spacers: USA, I'll be making these myself.  \nThe origin of Airfoil Click is starting to look a bit like a melting pot.  \n \nPost Kickstarter Airfoil Prices:  Airfoil Click may retail for the following approximate prices. For this Kickstarter the reward prices are very very close to future wholesale prices so now is the time to get the best deal possible :) \n\nAirfoil Aluminum: $75, subsequent anodized models may go for a higher price \nAirfoil Titanium: $150 \nAirfoil Electropolished Titanium: $175 \nAirfoil 24K Gold plated: Debating if I should sell for $250+ or choose to keep quantity limited for exclusivity.  \n \n\n\n \n Risks and challenges Everything is set up and ready to go once funding is complete. This is my second kickstarter pen project so I've done this before. The process is familiar to me already. I've produced hundreds of custom pens and am very confident that this project should not run into any catastrophic problems. \n\nIn my previous project my backers were very pleased and impressed with the execution of the rewards and the final product. I hope to raise the bar with this project. \n\nThe success of this project depends heavily on sharing this project. Every blog or social networking makes a difference, so please share!

    "textDescription": "Story This project’s goal is a fully featured port of VLC media player to the new Windows 8 User Experience. A second release will also add support for Microsoft’s Surface tablets. VLC media player for Windows is currently installed on about 100,000,000 devices worldwide. The existing version runs on Windows 8’s desktop mode, and is available only for Intel-based PCs. This new port will be natively integrated within the new User Experience and will also support ARM-based tablets in a subsequent release Similar to the desktop version of VLC media player, you will be able to play all files, all your discs and all your network streams. All of that in a native, beautiful and easy-to-use interface. In contrast to the built-in media player, VLC for Windows 8 we intend to add support for DVDs and VCDs out-of-the box as well as unencrypted Blu-Rays. All the features known from our current releases will be retained like a full fledged equalizer, video filters and superior support for subtitles. We will pursue a fully-compliant app for submission to the Windows Store in order to reach as many users as possible, and to provide a consistent installation and update experience. This fundraiser is run to allow experienced core members of the VideoLAN team to work on this new port full-time. We expect an initial release within three months after finishing the fundraiser. This would not be possible to do with volunteers. A successful fundraiser will also allow us to hire professional designers to build a beautiful and clean user interface. Any code touching the user interface created within this endeavor will be licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later (GPLv2+), possibly with an exception for the Windows Store if needed.Low level libraries and contributions to VLC's existing code base will be licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 or later (LGPLv2.1+) following the recent developments in the VLC project. VLC for Windows 8 will be brought to you by Geoffroy Couprie, Jean-Baptiste Kempf, Rafaël Carré, Ludovic Fauvet, Felix Paul Kühne, and Kellen Robert Sunderland with help from Kieran Kunhya. You can find details in the biography section. Risks and challenges VLC for Windows 8 will be developed by experienced core members of the VideoLAN team working full-time to achieve the best result in the shortest possible time.\n\nPrior to starting this fundraiser, we created prototypes with working video and audio playback of local files to make sure that this project is actually feasible.\nThe biggest challenge of this endeavour is the integration of our current workflow based on GNU tools with Microsoft’s native development toolkit. Our prototypes were easier to interleave than we anticipated.\n\nWe expect minor issues with the sandbox included in the WinRT runtime, which might hinder the inclusion of our existing LUA scripts for YouTube, Vimeo, … integration. However, we are confident to solve these once we have actually started. While our optical media playback code should work as is, it may be prevented to do so by Windows RT's sandbox. It is yet to be found out whether it is permissive enough or not.\n\nA goal of this port is the inclusion in the Windows Store. While we think it is feasible, there is a significant number of forbidden API calls, so in theory, VLC for Windows 8 might not be applicable for the store. We will do our best to achieve a successful publication on the store, so side loading isn't needed.\nVLC for Windows 8 will be licensed under both the GPLv2+ and the LGPL2.1+ depending on the respective code functionality. It is still subject to thorough checks whether these licenses are compatible with the Windows Store's terms of service. Publication on the store depends on the results of this investigation.\n\nFor file system IO and network access, the development of a low level library might be needed due to the re-written APIs provided by Windows RT. This potential library will be shared with any interested party, so other open source applications will benefit from our work. \n\nThe initial release of VLC for Windows 8 will run on x86-based devices. Support for the ARM architecture will be added in a subsequent release, since this will involve further development work. The amount of work needed to tackle this subproject can hardly be estimated at this point. However, we are confident to get this done based upon our prior experience on competing ARM based platforms like Android and iOS.\n\nA major hurdle for us is to take VLC for Windows 8 and get it to run on ARM based Windows RT devices. This is because there is currently no stable toolchain available that supports all the features we need in order to cross-compile the libVLC library for Windows RT. While Microsoft provides its default development environment, it is not of much help to us at the lower libVLC level, which uses advanced features of the C language as well as custom, hand written assembly code. Both of these are incompatible with Visual Studio, so we will be required to adapt a mingw-w64 derivative for this purpose. This is feasible, since this is what we used for the past 10 years to provide VLC on Windows, but it will take time.\n\nA major benefit of this subproject will be a working mingw-w64 environment for all the other projects with their roots in the UNIX/Linux world.

    "textDescription": "Story The Story In 1829, Mary Howitt published a powerful poem called “The Spider and the Fly.” It's a cautionary tale that both entertains and instructs. Today, this beloved story still delivers the same masterful and relevant message its author intended. We're excited to announce that a brand NEW poem has been written to complement Howitt's original text. In 2008, author M. Andrew Smith wrote a contrasting invitational tale called “The Lion and the Lamb.” Developed with inspirational illustrations by illustrator Ty Harmon, these two creative gems come together to deliver a doctrinal and more complete message of caution and HOPE! Combining remarkable rhythm with inspiring imagery, this interactive app and printed book project presents a message of warning through the cautionary tale of \"The Spider and the Fly.\" Children will gain a better understanding of the power, influence, and methods the Spider (Devil) tries to use to lure the Fly (us) into his dangerous web. In contrast, the invitational tale of \"The Lion and the Lamb\" teaches how the Lion (God) lovingly invites the Lamb (us) into His Kingdom. The book and app provide an engaging and creative way to teach these essential principles on a level that can be understood at any age. The Inspiration\n\n More than 35 years ago, while serving as a fulltime missionary for my church, I (Mark Smith) became impressed by the powerful message contained in Mary Howitt’s cautionary tale, “The Spider and the Fly.” I used this poem many times to illustrate the devil’s desire to entrap mankind in his web of deceit. Although I love this voice of warning regarding the tempter’s tools, I began to feel the message was incomplete.  “The Spider and the Fly” only presented the adversary’s perspective, outlining some of Satan’s most effective methods and means of temptation. What about the other force of influence, God? What methods and means does He use to persuade His children to come unto Him? Using the Bible as a resource and inspiration to answer these questions I wrote a mirroring, yet contrasting, poem to show the subtle differences between the Devil’s approach and the Lord’s approach. My poem, \"The Lion and the Lamb\" is an invitational tale that teaches the principle of hope through Christ (the Lion) using scriptural references as to how He sincerely and lovingly invites us to come into His kingdom. The Vision The vision of this project goes beyond just a children's book and app. Our hope is to continue providing a positive influence to children with these stories through classroom readings, school assemblies, and other group presentations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT he Project More and more, apps are being developed for children on smartphones and tablets. While many of them are fun, few of them actually promote or teach Christian principles. We want to offer parents the opportunity to provide their children with a resource of \"edutainment\" endorsing the values they hold dear. Through these beautifully written and illustrated stories the app and book will create an interactive environment for learning, whether used alone or in a family or group setting!  We’re seeking funding for our new app and book project, “The Spider and the Fly.” Pledges received will be used to cover the costs of design, narration, music, and other app production, as well as publishing, marketing and distribution of the printed book. \nBelow are some images to give you a sneak peak of the app. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The writing and illustrations have already been completed so the biggest challenge will be the wait time associated with printing and shipping of the book and the development time of the app.\n\nWe do not anticipate any delays, but if anything does happen, we'll make sure that everybody knows what's happening and what we're doing to solve the problem. \n\n\nStretch Goals – Give Back\n\n$25K – Once we’ve achieved our bare-bones financial goal, let’s see how far our reach can exceed our grasp. When we exceed $25,000 in pledges we will donate 100 hard cover copies of “The Spider and the Fly” book to children's hospitals and/or libraries.\n\n$30K – When we obtain $30,000 or more in pledges we will donate 200 hard cover copies of “The Spider and the Fly” book to children's hospitals and/or libraries.

A more precise date will be listed once the campaign ends and we know how much extra content will be added. Latest Campaign News: \nUpdate #9: Second Stretch Goal Achieved \nUpdate #8: Add-ons reminder and details. \nUpdate #7: Note about paypal and goals \nUpdate #6: First Stretch Goal Achieved. \nUpdate #5: Getting Closer to the 1st Stretch Goal. \nUpdate #4: Goal Reached, Add-ons Announced. \nUpdate #3: Meet the Artists of the Game. \nUpdate #2: New Game Backgrounds Previewed. \nUpdate #1: Over 25% funded on the first day! \n Introduction For the past eighteen months we, with the support of Kickstarter and our community, have been building the Sword of Asumi visual novel game. Now after a lot of work and testing the game is close to the end and has been accepted through Steam's Greenlight service for release there as well.  We have now prepared the game and begun our Steam beta testing on PC, Mac and Linux, but we have realized that now we are ready for such a big release we want to add another set of features to the game to make it really shine. New Features for Inclusion So without further ado, these are our first set of items we want to add to the game, which is why we have returned to Kickstarter... \nDedicated CG scene un-lockable Gallery \nAdditional Musical Tracks & Effects \nSteam Trading Cards & Rewards \nAdditional Steam Integration \n In the end we felt it would be preferable to try and crowd fund the games bonus features rather than run the game through Steams Early Access feature. We feel as we can only launch the game once we want it to be a full release rather than an almost finished one. So if we are funded here we will aim to include all bonus features in addition to the rest of the games content before we launch the game 'officially' on steam. And all of our game and higher backers will get instant access to the beta and future releases on and off steam as well. \n\nAbout the Game The Sword of Asumi has gone through many iterations to reach its current status, being developed over the past eighteen months it has contracted in over five different voice actors, two sound engineers, a couple of coders and about five different artists at various stages. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been steadily learning how to develop the game so that now it includes all of the following features: \nGame on PC, Mac & Linux \nStrong Female, Protagonist \nMusic Jukebox \nUn-lockable Codex \nOver ten different NPCs \nOver 50,000 word script \nMultiple Game Endings \nSome Voice Acting & Effects \nAnd a selection of great CG scenes \n4 Love interests (feat. Male & Female Characters) \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith your help we want to take the great story and expand it even further, if enough funds can be received we will take some of the relationships even further as well as add an un-lockable CG scene gallery to the extras. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to all of the content already due to be included, this campaign will allow us to allocate more funds so that our artists can deliver even more amazing CG scenes to illustrate important events within the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the Sword of Asumi you will be taking control of Asumi as she must locate a rebel within a prestigious academy for the samurai, your decisions will determine who lives and who dies and whether Asumi finds peace, acceptance or even love. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith your help we can not only finish an already great game, but create the ultimate edition whether you want it on Steam or as a digital DRM free download... About the Rewards In addition to the game we have a variety of digital and physical rewards available for our backers to receive, all of which will help us reach our goal... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types of rewards Digital/Physical items or the Design rewards. First we will go into detail about the Digital/Physical items before explaining the digital items afterwards... Digital/Physical Items £10 - Sword of Asumi Visual Novel Game At this Early Bird reward level you will receive the game at the best possible pricing level.

The track lists are playable in the game, but this will allow you to play them separately as well and will also include any new tracks added to the game. \n .soundcloud .card {\n max-height: 250px;\n }\n .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {\n height: 220px;\n }\n .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {\n height: unset;\n }\n \n\n\n£50 - Sword of Asumi Ltd.E DVD In addition to the above described rewards we are only intending to create a small limited run of the Sword of Asumi physical DVDs, they will be printed at the conclusion of the campaign and then held ready for when the game is finalized, no additional copies will be created at a later date making this a unique reward. DVD art will be posted as the campaign continues. £65 - Swords of Edo Physical Poster In addition to the above described rewards, you will at this level also receive a physical poster immediately, you can select any of the below images at the campaigns conclusion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£200 - Asumi Limited Edition Figurine We recently completed funding for a limited edition figurine of the main protagonist 'Asumi', we are therefore able to offer this figurine as an extra reward in this campaign. This is a very limited run and will only be available during this campaign. \n\n\nMore images of which will be posted as the campaign continues. \n \n\n \n\n\nDesign Rewards In addition to the above rewards we also have a selection of design rewards, which allow you to decide and describe different items to appear in the game from clothing to background and even to create new characters and events. All the Design rewards below come with the Game on Steam and DRM free download, the Graphic Novel PDF and the Games Downloadable Soundtrack... £80 - NPC Clothing This design reward will give you the option to choose any clothing you want for a major NPC within the game to wear. We will then work it into the game for you. We like crazy, fun or serious, you choose! £100 - Asumi Clothing As with the first design reward except now you can design clothing for Asumi to be trying on, most likely while playing around on a sleepover or on a shopping night with friends. £125 - Background Design Put your stamp on the game by deciding on some special background to be designed for the game and then included within it. £150 - In Game Event/Scene At this level not only can you design a special background to appear in the game but you can also design an event for that background, maybe Asumi goes on a night mission or goes on a date... You decide and it could even effect the game endings! £175 - New Minor NPC Character Our biggest design reward allows you to describe and name a new minor NPC within the game. This character will appear multiple times as either a member of the academy or as an instructor, whichever you prefer. N.b. All of these design rewards also include your name added to the credits acknowledging your contribution to the games development. Goals & Most Wanted Our main goal will allow us to start working on the extra items as we continue with the closed Beta development of the game, however if we can exceed this goal the following levels should ensure these items will definitely appear in the game also... \n\nACHIEVED - Additional Music, Sound Effects & CG Gallery \n\nACHIEVED  - More Backgrounds & Locations within the Game \n\nACHIEVED - Steam Trading Cards Included on Release \n\n£  5,000 - Secret Physical DVD Bonus (TBA when goal reached) \n \n\n£  7,500 - Increase the amount of un-lockable CG scenes\n \n\n£10,000 - Alternate 'Adult' edition of the game. (non-steam only) \n \n N.b. If we exceed our £10k goal then we will work with all extra funds to create more steam integration's, we hope to include Steam Achievements and Cloud Support in addition to the Trading Cards... Though this cannot be guaranteed we will do everything we can to support it. Risks and challenges Thanks to a lot of work and previous Swords of Edo campaigns we have already created 90% of the main game, this includes character designs, CG artwork, backgrounds, music, voice acting and sound effects.\n\nThis final bit of funding is so that we can extend the game further with more items and features than are possible on our current budget. If successful it will allow us to continue the game in closed beta for our kickstarter backers until our wishlist of extra features has been completed.\n\nTherefore whatever happens with the campaign, whether we reach the goal, exceed it or fall short, we are already confident that the full game will be released to our backers in the best possible way but naturally the more we can receive the better it will be for the game we can release.

    "textDescription": "Story Simply the best record crate More vinyl is being sold today than ever before. Coincidentally, our personal collections are growing, too. We are a trio of friends who share a mutual frustration with the status quo of record storage options. When faced with storing, organizing, and lending our records, we had always struggled to find a solution that really worked. We analyzed the problems and designed the solution; a  record crate we  wanted to buy. It had to do everything better and be something we would be proud of.  The crate snaps together without any tools or hardware and ships completely flat. No worrying about missing screws and bolts, nothing to scratch our sleeves, no fasteners to weaken over time, and no fear of damage in transit. Built from sturdy 1/2-inch hardwood , Wax Stacks will last a lifetime. We hope you'll love our fresh approach to record storage and we know you'll find the crate useful for many other things; book case, toy box, stepping stool, etc... Going together is a SNAP! \n\n\nWAX STACKS crates consist of five panels made entirely in the USA with sustainable (i.e. conservatively harvested and sensibly produced) birch plywood. Assembly requires no fasteners, no tools, and no instructions. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of unique locking tabs \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nGet just one or get as many as you need. Our crates are sturdy and built to stack. The alternating ridge locks each crate in place when stacked. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur crates are built to stack in several configurations. Stack them upright for storage or moving. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow off your vinyl. Your prized collection should be as easy to admire as it is to search through. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur crates stack either upright or facing out. Change them around to suit your needs. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability is the key with any crate. Ours is just as sturdy to haul as it is to stack! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWax Stacks are built with 1/2-inch baltic birch plywood. It is meant to be hauled around and built to last as long as your collection. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur crates are deep enough to keep your sleeves safe. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur crates are also portable.

Crate Design In a nutshell, we want to be able to stack, store, and carry our beloved vinyl. How about you?\n\nMeet your ultimate record storage solution.  We call our them \"WAX STACKS\". The term \"wax\" is a long-standing slang term for vinyl and our crates were built to stack. So there you have it - WAX STACKS. Let's see how it works. WAX STACKS crates consist of five panels made entirely in the USA with sustainable (i.e. conservatively harvested and sensibly produced) birch plywood. Assembly requires no hardware, no tools, and no instructions, and can be disassembled just as easily.  Components of our crate: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe middle and bottom pieces have an aesthetically interesting and functionally vital \"X\" cut into them. There are two locking tabs on each side that flex and mate with the dogbone slots on the handle panels. The sweeping curves that make up the \"X\"  serve two purposes: 1- allows the locking tooth to flex for assembly and, 2- when assembled the natural tension provided by the curve locks the crate together. Kinda cool, right? \n\n\n\n\nExact Dimensions - Plenty of room for any record \n \n\n \n\n\nAnother great feature is the alternating ridge on the handle panels. It looks like tabs on file folders. This was one of those try, try, and try again type discoveries and is a keystone component of our patent. It was worth the effort. This tabbed ridge allows our WAX STACKS to index correctly and stack on top of each other. In fact you can stack them any which way you like since the ridges go all the way around the panel.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy WAX STACKS reign supreme \n\nModularity:  Our crates can grow with you and your collection. Just getting started? One crate will do for now. You're an avid collector? No problem. You can rack and stack these to suit your needs.\n  \nEfficiency: Our crate ships flat and goes together without tools! Unbox and a few clicks later... voilà! Our 5-year-olds can put it together in under a minute. Yes, we can make them available to handle support calls. \nVersatility: They stack to suit your needs. Move them out of the way and stack them handles-up for easy grab 'n' go! Stack them forward-facing or \"bookcase style\" for regular use and album flipping. Better yet, grab a crate of greatest hits and take it over to your turntable. You could fill a crate with your coolest records and throw it in the back of your car to go spin with your friends.\n  \nDurability: They're sturdy and will PROTECT your records! We hit hi-fi shows with empty crates so we can buy tons of great vinyl and ship it home. \n \n\n\n\n\nShow your love with a T-shirt \n \n\n \n\n\nMachining Process \nWe've been working with a great local mill for production, and the process is fascinating. Our efficient layout results in almost no waste. Watch the video below to see how the crates are made. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff \n \n\n\n\nEnglish\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nOur Goals  \n$35,000  – The Minimum:   We’re going to make them anyway, but this is the amount we need to get costs down to a level that allows you to outfit your whole record collection. \n$50,000 - Custom Tooling:   Surpassing our initial goal will pay for a nested jig and custom tooling, which will improve quality and efficiency. Translation: we'll have less waste and you will get your crates FASTER! \n\nTimeline for producing Wax Stacks \n\n\n\nTimeline for rewards \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n Risks and challenges Our challenge isn't whether or not we can make them, but we need to invest in tooling and machine time to ramp up production. Kickstarter sales will allow us to get costs to a level that makes the crates a product for the masses. Kickstarter is really the best way to make it all happen.\n\nKickstarter is awesome! We are able to pre-sell a great product to a progressive customer. Simply put: we know selling tons of crates up front will really get things moving. We also feel the advertising medium of Kickstarter is spot on for enthusiasts just like us. Between the three of us we've already backed several campaigns.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Seen In  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a classic symbiotic relationship that benefits all. This is the best of free enterprise. Genius. \" - The Hill For most victims of sex trafficking, getting rescued only solves one part of the problem. They still struggle to get back on their feet and freely live in society. We started Threads of Freedom (ToF) to reintegrate these victims of sex trafficking back into society so that they can have their lives back and live free.    We've set up an innovative process by teaming up with nonprofits, government agencies and garment manufacturers, so that we are able to provide these women with training, employment and ongoing counseling.  The clothes we sell fuel this entire process. Large orders are placed, acting as an incentive to employ our candidates, then fulfilled by our manufacturing partners. The revenue we generate from selling these clothes funds our training, counseling and our mission as a whole.\n\n  We've launched our Kickstarter campaign to raise funds and produce our first set of premium quality t-shirts.\n\n  Our T-shirts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFashionable. Modern. Stylish. Our t-shirts provide you with a way to show support for an incredibly important cause while remaining fashion-forward. No matter what t-shirt you choose, our unique, expertly crafted designs will help you stand out from the crowd. \n\n Not only will you look good when you wear one of our shirts, you’ll feel good too. They are insanely soft and you’ll find they’re a comfortable, perfect fit. We’ve partnered with a factory that not only has fantastic working conditions, but also makes clothes for some of the world’s top clothing brands, like Tommy Hilfiger, Armani Exchange, and Ralph Lauren. When you receive one of our t-shirts you’ll immediately be able to tell that it is of extremely high quality. \n\n With our t-shirts you’re getting fashion and comfort for a cause. All our designs are available in Women's and Men's/Unisex style and in a V-neck or crewneck option. At the end of the campaign, we'll send a questionnaire asking you for your t-shirt style, design, and size. You can also get plain t-shirts without the designs on them. Customized Shirts \n\n  For backers who pledge $1000, we are offering 75 custom designed t-shirts.\n\nDetails:\n\n  \nYou may submit any design that has up to 3 colors (different shades are counted as different colors) \n  \nThe Design will be printed on the front of a white unisex crew-neck t-shirt \n Fit and Sizing\n\n  Our shirts are high quality with a modern fit, similar to shirts at Express or Guess. Please consult the sizing chart below for specific guidelines. \n\n\nSize Chart \n \n\n \n\n\nRewards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's talk a little bit about what these different reward levels are for:\n\n \n\n\nTraining vs Initiation vs Reintegration \n \n\n \n\n\nTraining - When you pledge $95, you are funding the training expenses for one candidate. This teaches her how to stitch and sew, and gets her ready for the job Initiation - When you pledge between $225 and $625, you sponsor the overall initiation cost for 1 to 3 candidates. This includes all costs borne for a beneficiary from the point she joins our program till she gets her first paycheck. This includes cost for training, food, accommodation, travel, medical expenses and other incidental expenditures. We consider this overall cost as the initiation expense for one beneficiary and you would be helping us cover these costs for 1 to 3 candidates depending on the level you choose\n\n Reintegration - Our work doesn't end once a candidate joins her job, we continue to counsel and take care of her till she is ready to be completely independent. $1000 covers the overall expense for reintegrating two of our beneficiaries. Not only does this cover the initiation expenses, it also covers ongoing costs for services that are necessary to completely get reintegrated. This includes salaries for the counselor, for the social worker who is available 24x7, and the staff who take care of her food, accommodation and her security. \n\n One Month’s Complete Care - Support us by covering one month's expenses for our overall program for all our beneficiaries. This covers our rent, and salaries for staff including the counselor, social worker, cook and security. The Issue \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost trafficked women lack the confidence and skills needed to reintegrate into society. Their past leaves them stigmatized; they’re spurned by their families and judged by potential employers. This leads to insecurity, isolation and an inability to start the next chapter in their lives.\n\n Threads of Freedom works with nonprofit rescue organizations, government agencies and professional clothing manufacturers to provide job training, employment, counseling and support for these exploited women, so they can reintegrate into society as respected and truly free individuals. Reintegration Process \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce admitted into our program, they receive full medical care and are provided food and accommodations. We offer a variety of services to ensure their continued growth and safety (see image above).\n\n  They then undergo training and are employed at a partner facility. Counselors are available for the entire time that they are members of the Threads of Freedom family. Manufacturing Process and Partnerships \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partnerships we maintain are the most unique and critical part of the process. Each manufacturing facility is carefully screened to ensure excellent working conditions. As incentive to hire candidates from our program, we place orders with each manufacturing facility. These orders are then sold by us (like the t-shirts available in this campaign).\n\n  Once hired, the candidates are incorporated into the fold like any other employee. The benefit is three-fold; the candidates can maintain their confidentiality, the facilities will have enough income to cover employee wages, and Threads of Freedom is able to oversee the entire process, from hiring to sale. Find out more about us at www.threadsoffreedom.org \n Risks and challenges We pride ourselves in delivering the best products to you on time, but everything isn’t always in our control, like shipping times. As a result, there might be slight delays that we cannot prevent. We will always do our absolute best to avoid such delays and will keep you posted if we ever find out that such a delay exists.\n\nFor customized t-shirts, if a submitted design cannot be printed exactly as is, we will work with you to sort everything out and ensure that you are 100% satisfied before printing.

    "textDescription": "Story This 60 page-story is a labour of love. It took me about four years to research and draw it during weekends and evenings. I did a first test print run that sold out, and now I'm looking to do a second, proper run. The story takes place in 1892 when Sherlock Holmes is presumed dead after his debacle with Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. Dr Watson and Detective Lestrade are called out to the countryside to solve a case of a young girl gone missing. \n\n\nColonel Moran in a cab \n \n\n \n\n\nThe story deals with dark themes like child abuse and what it was like being homosexual (and by default, a criminal) in the Victorian age. Nothing explicit though. If you have issues with two men snogging, consider yourself warned. If you wanna look and read before you pledge, the whole thing is online here http://devilry.deviantart.com/gallery/52280598/The-Silent-Girl \nWhat people are saying about The Case of the Silent Girl (none of which is my mum) \"I keep coming back to read it again it at least once a year because it is so marvelous\" \"Totally fantastic. The art is superb, and so is the dialogue\" \"Undoubtedly the best I have ever read online. You are an incredibly talented artist and storyteller, and reading this has been a distinct pleasure.\" \"Completely absorbing…addictive storytelling\" \"Utterly fantastic, the art, the story, the emotion. Brilliant work\" \"I just went throught what must be my fifth or sixth complete re-read of this comic. Completely stunning work!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to forget the postcards you will get if you pledge at the PDF+Postcards Level or above! They are made from two of my paintings: one depicts the Norse gods Odin and Heimdall racing across the sky, and the other shows the hobbits saying goodbye to Frodo at the end of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Yes, unrelated to the book but postcards are always nice to have. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges Low risk. The book is done and has already been printed once. The only additional work might be to add a backer or two into the background (see Rewards). \nIf you pledge for book and/or postcards you will receive them no later than november, and probably much earlier, unless there's a very unexpected event like volcanoes erupting or a yeti invation.

    "textDescription": "Story “It was honestly an experience I will remember for the rest of my life!” Words from an audience member after experiencing Chasing Blue (April 2015 ). It was not an uncommon response: several people referred to the play as undergoing a “religious experience,” others divulged their need to figure out something deep about themselves--their sexuality, their sense of self-worth. I had been writing and rehearsing the play for a year and a half with Andrew, my brilliant director, when we premiered it at Northwestern University to overwhelmingly transformative (pun intended) reactions.  Set six months after I came out as transgender during the most upheaving era of my life, Chasing Blue takes place in my bathroom in the hour I have to get ready for a fast-approaching date. From the safety and warmth of my bathtub, I physically prepare myself for the possibility of romance (shaving, dressing, doing makeup) and emotionally prepare myself for the inevitable corresponding threat of vulnerability. Intimately autobiographical, tenderly and fiercely told through stories, poetry, music, and spectacle, Chasing Blue chronicles my perilous journey toward my transgender identity, all the while asking: when everyone else has left, how can we begin to live with ourselves?  Several rewrites and one year later, we’re back and ready for action. In June, Andrew and I are bringing Chasing Blue to New York as part of The Trans Theatre Festival at The Brick , a theater in Brooklyn. As our first professional production we aim to make as great an impact as we can and we need your help! Between shooting new video projections for the play with filmmakers Alex Thompson and the BAFTA-winning Zoe Lubeck, travel and housing costs, as well as renting that darned bathtub--we have designed a strategic budget. After taking advantage of grants, volunteer support, work trades, and personal funds, the rest of our budget we hope to accomplish via donation.  It is not often that trans people are given the resources to tell our own stories on our own terms. Your assistance demonstrates a commitment to the need, importance, and value of our artistic work as well as of greater trans advocacy. Thank you in advance for all your support of Andrew, myself, and our beloved Chasing Blue .  Queerly,  Bea Cordelia Risks and challenges Going hungry! We need about $6000 total to fully produce this play. Any more that we raise will go into actually, fairly paying artists for their contributions to the project (what an idea!). So if we've already hit our $4000 mark, please: KEEP DONATING. Hungry artists will thank you.\n\nOther than that, all our risks are calculated and our challenges surmountable. \nThis ain't our first rodeo, y'all.

Considering our production set up there can be challenges we haven't foreseen. We've added buffers to the lead times just in case. \n\nDuty/VAT charges: If you live outside of the EU, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges. \n\nCustoms: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs, and you probably know if you live in one.

    "textDescription": "Story Why are we doing this? Ever since Ben was a kid,\napples have been his life. In 2008 he moved to Anchorage, AK and noticed that\nthe local apple selection was both expensive and limited. He has been yearning\nfor quality fruit ever since. Alaska Bug Bites is\nthe first step in bringing delicious fruits and vegetables to the markets in Alaska and keeping them available year-round.Last spring, Ben launched a Kickstarter with the intention of building a commercial kitchen trailer for producing dehydrated fruit and vegetable chips. While the campaign itself failed, it brought in enough interest to get the ball rolling. Friends, family, and a few cities filled with kind people enabled Ben to gather everything needed to build the trailer. The original plan has changed slightly, but definitely for the better! The dehydrator now has over 500 square feet of drying space and the kitchen is more efficient than ever before! Ben has spent the last year demolishing, redesigning, and constructing the various elements needed for a successful business. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaska Bug Bites is a local Alaskan company with the hopes of dehydrating fruit\nand vegetable chips starting May 1st, 2017. We have already started sampling\nideas with our friends and neighbors, running them past everyone we know. The\nresults have been outstanding! So far we have tested numerous batches including\nblueberries, tomatoes, pineapples, bell peppers, apples, strawberries, and much\nmore. The apple chips disappear before everyone in the room even gets a chance\nto taste them, and the other fruits and veggies vanish right after!Unlike other dried foods on the market, we have developed methods which provide super thin and crisp chips instead of the more typical thick, soft dried chews available in the bulk sections of some stores. With a lower moisture content, our crisps have longer shelf lives without the need for sulfur dioxide or other preservatives. Our thin crisps dry faster than others as well, better maintaining the fruit's natural texture, flavor, and colors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom our simply\nsweet apple, pear, orange, and chocolate drizzled strawberry, to the savory\nsamplings of lightly salted cucumber, carrot, and tomato; everyone seems to\nlove the crisp and light textures.\n \n\nWhat is our long-term goal? Unfortunately, Alaska has very limited supplies of locally grown food. We are sourcing our produce from Alaskan farmers, growing our own when possible, utilizing local manufacturers for our specialized equipment, and hiring from within our community. Of course, some things are simply not feasible to grow in Alaska. Our pineapple chips and other tropical fruits have quite the journey! We are sourcing these through Alaskan produce distributors.We are \nlocally harvesting blueberries, apples, currants, tomatoes, \nstrawberries, raspberries, and some vegetables to keep shipping costs \ndown and to support agriculture within our community. These local \nresources will provide a portion of our produce supply, but there is not\n enough to operate for the entire year.\n \n\n\nLocally-harvested Alaskan Blueberries! \n \n\n \n\n\nHow can you help? Pick one (or several!) of the rewarding rewards from our list of options. Scream our name around town! Tell your friends, neighbors, coworkers, parents, kids, cats, dogs, and any hungry moose you happen to pass on the trails. Pick one of our rewards and show it off to everyone you know. Help us bring good food to all the good mouths near you. Oh, and did we mention you should pick a reward? They are very rewarding.How will this money be spent? In order to sell our chips at the numerous markets and fairs within the state, we will need over $200 worth of business licenses for the various cities and boroughs, nearly $10,000 worth of market  and fair booth fees, enough gas money for over 10,000 miles, a few pallets of packaging, labels, and the last few layers of permit fees. We are hoping to raise $2000 in order to pay for the remainder of our permitting, the first few weekend market fees, fair application fees, and enough fruit and vegetables to start production. Once we are producing, where can you find us? We\n are planning to have multiple booths operating each week at nearly all of the farmers markets, fairs, and holiday shows within South Central Alaska. All the way from Soldotna to Fairbanks. Our regular booth at the Anchorage Downtown Market and \nFestival every weekend May-September will be providing samples and sales to the more than \n600,000 visitors that stop in each summer. That is more than 30,000 \npeople each weekend! During the week we will be present at several local markets as well as delivering orders\n to restaurants, bars, gift shops, bakeries, cafes, grocery stores, tea shops, \nand anywhere else interested in delicious local products.Check out our website for more up-to-date information! \n\n\nHelp bring these delicious strawberry chips to Alaska \n \n\n \n\n  Risks and challenges Dehydrating is one of the least energy-intensive means of preserving food. It simply takes heat and airflow. Even with such simple requirements, heat isn't always easy to find this far North. Our kitchen is starting with propane and generator power, but we hope to start utilizing Alaska's immense solar opportunities as soon as possible. This is a hurdle we would like to pass before the end of the summer, but we need the right start to make it in time.\n\nWith Alaska's limited and expensive supply of produce, we are already planting our future products so we can have them ready in time to meet demand. This spring we will be constructing greenhouses, raised beds, garden walls, and establishing irrigation all while completing the kitchen permit process and making the first batches of chips. This is a hefty challenge we are meeting by carefully planning each day months ahead of time and exploring the best options for each need.

A way to get to know others at a class or conference? \nEnter Quick Query! Quick Query is a simple and easy way to connect with others. Questions are work friendly! \n\n\nCard design! \n \n\n \n\n\nHow does it work? It's super easy! Pick a card from the deck, ask a question, and have fun!  How did Quick Query get started? Last year I started working with a new team and wanted to come up with a way for us to get to know each other better. Before we started a meeting I asked a simple question that each person answered. While it only took a few seconds to answer, it really changed our meetings and interactions in a positive way. Everyone knows each other better, we have more fun, and I have even gotten feedback that productivity has gone up. The questions have even spread to other meetings within the company. Yay! \n\n\nTuckbox design! \n \n\n \n\n\nWhat's with the flying squirrel wearing glasses? The squirrel design was created for my website and social media under SquirrelFriday. I love squirrels and I wear glasses, so why not a flying squirrel wearing glasses?! I thought this design would make a fun back for the cards. What do you get? Quick Query is a complete set of poker size playing cards with a question on each card, including the Jokers. That is a total of 54 questions! The cards are 2.25\" x 3.5\" and printed on 310gsm, casino quality, smooth finish paper. The cards are cello wrapped and come in a custom tuckbox. \n\nFunding goal:  The amount of $750 will cover printing costs, packaging, and shipping within the United States. I've also figured in the approximately 10% in Kickstarter and Amazon fees. Contributors: I want to thank the people who helped contribute to this project with questions and encouragement: Emily, Julia Jurgens, Renee Bibby, Leila Nassar, Jamilia N., Karen, Allison Golinkoff, Erica Sinkovic, Jason Pope, Keith Brown, and Nikola,  And thank you to those who appeared in my video: Avocado Crisis, Bill Salfelder, Brad, Crystal Lemons, Danny Reckless, Diattle Gore, Kim Delacy, and Trae Davis. Thanks for taking time to check out my project and thank you for backing! Risks and challenges I'm using a printer that has worked with other Kickstarter projects (http://customizedplayingcards.com) The design and layout of the cards is already done. Once the project is successfully funded, I just need to contact the printer with the quantity to print.\n\nThere should be no risks involved unless equipment fails at the printer and delays printing. In this worst case scenario, I will provide updates to backers. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

For me, it is sharing a part of my soul to the world in hopes that those who sometimes have a hard time expressing themselves, in the good times and bad, know that they are never alone. No matter how far away they feel from home, that these artistic projects and pieces become a story to relate to, a comforting shoulder to lean on, and a reminder that there is always hope to keep going and live their artistic dreams.\nFrom the first day my dear friend told me to share my work with the world, I have not stopped in trying to do so. Many creative projects have come about and I cannot wait to share it with you all. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs I went through my \"heArtistic\" writing journey, I had moments of synchronicity and signs to create more, inspire more, and encourage the bigger purpose of WrittenwitheArt. So with this mission, WrittenWitheArt was born. Much like all things, I believe we should pursue all of our goals, with heArt. Whether painted, danced, produced, acted, or performed, it is all created or \"written\" from us, with heArt. I will utilize all projects from WrittenWitheArt as tools to support and encourage all artists, to go after their artistic dreams. \n\n\nOil On Canvas \n \n\n \nThe first book of WrittenWitheArt will specialize in 20 of my personal written and painted pieces of heArt. They show an example of the emotions we go through in life, from happiness, anger, heartache, overcoming challenges, and finding love. This book is to encourage artistic expression and assure others that in that journey they are not alone. As my dear friend stated, maybe someone on the other side of the world has a hard time expressing themselves, but this artistic piece helps them to do that. All WrittenWitheArt's projects will be used to help others cross that artistic bridge and not be afraid to express themselves. WrittenWitheArt does not only become a brand or organization, but an overall movement to pursue all artistic dreams that we are passionate about, with heArt. CREATION \nOceans away and worlds apart\nBreathing, relinquishing indescribable scriptures of history\nReluctant sweet release of every weight on your shoulder\nto create a new story untold\nPeace of soul and piece of mind traveling distances unknown\nand making what your heart feels' home\nSacrifice to believe and live every passion in your head to your bones\nCreating love from the sand living life unforeseen of what could be\nOnly knowing he chose me\nLimit less possible ties encouraging life built of only tries\nlearning what you were born to know seeping from your veins and  eyes\nkeeping what your heart feels\nright just\nliving in your mothers eyes. -K.P.

We need your help to purchase some of the necessary equipment for our production kitchen. \n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS PROJECT Uptown Juice Company is building a cold production kitchen and retail space. After almost a year of making juice in a shared commissary kitchen, we’ve finally found a home on a historic block in Uptown Oakland. Building out this space is a HUGE project for us and, not to mention, quite expensive. We need your help to purchase the equipment we need in order to provide our wonderful and delicious juices to the residents and employees of Oakland and the greater Bay Area community. This includes: commercial cold-press juicer, walk-in refrigerator to store our organic produce and bottled juices, bottle washing machine to recycle and reuse our glass bottles and reduce plastic waste in our environment, stainless steel prep tables, sinks, and much, much more. YOUR SUPPORT  By supporting us you're not only supporting this small business and helping us to become more sustainable, you're also supporting the local community and economy, organic agriculture, and allowing us to provide more jobs. Once this kitchen is ready we'll be able to increase our production, which means Uptown Juice Company will be creating more jobs in the local economy. Uptown Juice Company will also be able to buy more organic produce from local farmers who are growing food in sustainable ways. \n\n\n\n\n\nOUR PRODUCT Uptown Juice Company makes organic, cold-pressed juices from fresh, organic produce that's sourced locally whenever possible. We don't add water or sugar, so our juice is deliciously intact with all of the enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins, and nutrients that your body needs.

As soon as we receive the green light, construction will begin immediately.\n\n- We will use the money raised from this Kickstarter campaign to order all of the necessary equipment for our business to open on time (currently slated for May 2014). Lead time for some of our equipment to arrive after being ordered is 2-3 months so it’s important for us to meet and/or exceed the Kickstarter project goal and get our equipment ordered right away.\n\nThis kitchen is well on it’s way to being built and your contributions will help to make it complete.

    "textDescription": "Story Drinking water is the most vital and valuable resource on Earth. My team and I have been working since January to develop a system that will produce clean drinking water without using fossil fuels, or electricity. This system will be portable, be greenhouse gas emissions free, and will produce a minimum of 2 gallons per day, which is the daily need of a family of four.  In order to avoid the use of fossil fuels and electricity, we decided to use solar energy, which is available anywhere in the world. We are going to use solar concentrators to collect the energy from a greater area and focus this power right onto an evacuated solar tube. This solar tube is made out of two  vacuumed layers of glass. A heat pipe, which contains a mixture of water and alcohol, is held inside the solar tube, and will be heated by the sun's concentrated radiation. The head of this heat pipe will be placed in a small boiler, where the salty/dirty water will be boiled. The clean water vapor will be forced into a long copper pipe which will be cooled by air and by room temperature salty/dirty water running through a smaller pipe inside this first pipe. This will act as a condenser (double-pipe heat exchanger with parallel flows), and drinking water will be collected at the outlet of this condenser.  Our budget is very limited and this is why we are presenting our project to you, hoping that it caught your attention. We are aware of the need for drinking water in remote areas and third-world countries, and this is why we are eager to complete this unique and innovative project and share our results with the world, hoping that it positively impacts the society.  \n\n\nOur Project's Abstract \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges The biggest risk we could encounter is that our prototype does not work as well as expected, although the analysis results are promising.

I knew how to draw and paint, and I felt confident in the story, but it was also clear to me that there was a lot i didn't know about making comic books.     In the summer of 2009 I took some time off from work to attend a summer session at the Center for Cartoon Studies. I was privileged to meet some amazing artists during my week in White River Junction; I was awed by their talent, dedication and determination. One thing I took from that experience was the realization that one can go to a store, buy a bunch of yarn and needles, go on-line, get some patterns but, unless you actually sit down and knit, you won't end up with a sweater.     There was so much I had to learn and hardly knew where to begin besides the obvious step of simply drawing.    I reached out to my community and found a wealth of resources; over the next few months, I acquired a good computer, a Wacom tablet, the Adobe Creative Suite, and recruited knowledgable individuals willing to share their skills. I learned to use a new set of media and overcame many technical, logistical, artistic and emotional challenges, including simply finding the time and motivation to work while maintaining jobs, relationships, and other obligations.    I have finally hit a stride with this project and, as I close in on getting the art work done, I am ready to start looking at the next step(s).    The bulk of the money I raise will go towards printing costs. I hope to print 1000 copies of a full color, 40 page comic.     In the Vermont tradition, I try to support local business; all my printing needs will be provided by businesses right here in Brattlevegas. Other expenses include some wages to sub contractors such as graphic design assistance, web production and map making.     I am negotiating with a map maker from New Zealand who has worked with directors famous for epic, big-budget, fantasy films.    I was told that, like drugs, you always give 'em the first one for free, therefore, I have allocated a portion of the budget towards distribution costs, promotions and kickstarter backer rewards which include posters, t-shirts, and an art exhibition.    Thank you for helping me create this comic.  Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story HOW TO HELP This documentary will reveal the cruel secret that some in the various equine breeding industries don’t like to acknowledge or talk about: Every year during breeding season, hours-old, non-pedigreed foals are taken from their mothers, whose job is to be a nurse mare to a pedigree foal. This cycle continues, over and over. The foals with championship potential are nourished by nurse mare’s milk critical to the health and survival of a baby horse. But what happens to the non-pedigreed and discarded foals? Many are left to die.  Victoria Goss and her small crew save about 150 foals during foaling season every January through June. Working directly with a few nurse mare farms in Southern Ohio and Kentucky, they pick up eight to ten foals at a time as soon as they get a phone call. Leaving at dawn with an empty horse trailer, they return in late afternoon with a new batch of hours-old foals ready to be cared for, nursed to health and readied for adoption. Victoria’s low 2 percent mortality rate astounds veterinarians. When the foals are stabilized, they are adopted by those qualified in equine care and housing. Some have become stars in their own right as therapy horses. In October 2010, I volunteered at Last Chance Corral in Athens, Ohio, to muck stalls and help stock hay into one of the three barns on the property. Little did I know nor understand what this horse rescue organization has done since 1991. When I fully grasped the plight of the nurse mare foals, I was still drop-jawed with questions. Telling this story about the heroic work performed by Last Chance Corral founder Victoria Goss has become my passion.  I need your help. Without this Kickstarter, future work on this documentary is in jeopardy. But more importantly, creating awareness about the nurse mare foals will not be possible and more horses will die.  Born to Die is currently just under 11-minutes in length (which became my master's project at Ohio University in 2012). It is my goal to create a 30-minute feature that expands the story to show the viability of these horses. All expenses have been out of pocket. It's what we do for the love of a story, right? Kickstarter funding will be used for documented expenses that have helped create the current story, which include equipment,  travel, transportation and meals to Athens, Ohio. Post-production editing is a large part of what is ahead. Also built into the funding are expenses for gifts, shipping and fees for Kickstarter (5%) and Amazon (3-5%).  I hope you will join me in telling this important story.

My deep experiences as a journalist have given me mad skills in time management, problem solving and figuring out resources. I feel confident in pulling this off in a reasonable amount of time to submit to film festivals possibly in late 2015 and for sure in 2016.

We all have a competitor at something we love, whether that be sports, video game leader boards or, for some, bird watching. Alan Argus has the dream of being the local bird watching legend, however: the cunning Bernie Samson currently sits at the throne. He's won Bird watcher of the month award eleven times in a row, and won't stop bragging that he's about to make it to twelve.\nAnd this weekend turns out to be primetime for bird watchers; Coco Cola's parrot mascot Coco, from the adverts on TV, has escaped and is on the loose.\nDetermined now not to miss this opportunity, Alan packs his camera, binoculars and some warm clothes as he camps out all night, waiting for Coco. The Bird Nerd shows that no matter what you're passionate about, and whatever gets in your way there's always light at the end of the tunnel. The Bird Nerd is a short comedy film being made by 16-20 year olds from across the UK, all of whom have been handpicked by the National Film and Television School as the next generation of British Filmmakers. Our absolutely bare minimum budget for the film is just £400. Any excess money we raise will go toward hiring out more elaborate props and costumes, in order to give the film a sense of slightly hightened reality and hence greater production values. At the moment, the majority or our budget considers: a) hiring out some awesome locations in the Herefordshire countryside; b) hiring techincal equipment such as lights and grip equipment; c) transport for all of our amazing crew from across the UK to attend the shoot. \n\n\nWill (middle), our Director.

Risks and challenges Our challenges include:\n\n- Not being taken seriously because of our age: this can be solved by acting professionally and efficiently when on location and dealing with members of the general public.\n\n- Shooting outdoors in poor weather conditions: this will be solved by scheduling the shoot days and locations around weather forecasts (and, if necessary rewriting scenes to take place indoors).\n\n- The potential that cast and crew members may drop out/not be able to make the shoot: to solve this one, we'll have back up actors on standby, same applies for crew; we have a wide network of local contacts interested in making films.\n\n- Shooting scenes with the parrot: this will be very difficult, so in order to keep the parrot at ease (we have a real one secured), we will be shooting with a stripped back crew in 2nd Unit style, and keeping noise to an absolute minimum. The parrot will be composited with footage shot with actors elsewhere using chroma-keying (we have a network of visual effects artists prepared to work with us on this project).\n\n- Getting extras together for the opening scene (which is set in a pub): we will put out a call to any young, local people interested in acting and/or filmmaking to have the opportunity to be an extra in the film.\n\nAll of these can easily be solved, meaning we can make an awesome film- so please help us!\nNo funding = No film!

    "textDescription": "Story In 2015, Fisterra Studio created the Dance of the Cosmos sculpture. Artist Jennifer Chenoweth collaborated with many friends, including engineer John Dolecek and fabricator Robert Whitehurst, to create it. Dance of the Cosmos is a large scale kinetic and solar powered sculpture. Its shape was inspired by a Tibetan Lotus Mandala and Robert Plutchik’s wheel of emotions. The purpose of the artwork is to visualize the concept of acceptance and emotional wholeness. The flower opens and closes with the rising and setting of the sun.  It has been on temporary display on the grounds of the Elisabet Ney Museum on 45th Street since May 2015 as the first piece in the ongoing “artist in residence” program developed by the the museum's director, Oliver Franklin. Jennifer Chenoweth is now donating the sculpture to the people of the City of Austin. Dance of the Cosmos has found its permanent home at Patterson Park on Airport Boulevard just east of I-35.\nThe materials for the artwork were supported by a grant from the City of Austin’s Cultural Arts Division. The Austin Parks Foundation just awarded us a generous grant to fund the restoration and relocation of the piece by a landscape company. However, we must raise an additional $5,000 to donate to the Parks and Recreation Department to support its long-term maintenance (mechanical and electrical parts).  Why East Austin and Patterson Park? In recent years, Austin's east side has changed rapidly and dramatically, causing many citizens to feel a sense of disconnect to their community. Positioned at the intersection of several historic neighborhoods, the Mueller development, and traditional \"old\" East Austin, Patterson Park is centered at the thrust of this striking change. The park's location is an ideal bridge between these diverse communities, some residents of which feel largely forgotten by the city and often lack access to art and local centers of community. We hope that the sculpture will create a visual landmark that draws people, encourages community participation and increases positive use of the park.\n Friends of Patterson Park; the neighborhood associations of Mueller, Schieffer-Willowbrook, Cherrywood, and Delwood II; the Arts Commission and the Parks and Recreation Department have all voted to approve the donation. We need your help! The artist and fabricator have donated their time and labor. Can you help donate to the maintenance fund? We are happy to give you wonderful returns for your Kickstarter support.  THANK YOU! Jennifer Chenoweth (and friends) Risks and challenges If we cannot raise the funds to donate to the Parks and Recreation Department, the artwork installation and ribbon cutting ceremony will be delayed until we can.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nA Journey, two years in the making. \n   It seems like just yesterday I was writing the first book in the Night Terrors Series in a composition notebook. This story has been a lot of fun to write, and even more fun to watch grow. \n      Almost two years later from the first book's debut, the third installment is ready for publication. Now, with your help, we can make the next book in the series a reality! This novel will be approximately 250--260 pgs. \n\nCover for Night Terrors: Garden of Limbo \n\n   The Terror may have reached its end, but its taking Kitra along for the ride. \n\n     What if everything you had come to accept as fact, turned\nout to be a lie? When your dreams, and yes, even nightmares seemed far more real\nthan the waking world, how would you decide what was real, and what was a\ndream? \n  The \nworld I returned to was far from the sheltered place I had once known.\nEverything had changed. My parents were alive, and I, had never died. The more\nI tried to cling to my memories, the more it seemed like everything was\nbackwards. Like when I slept, when I got to see him again, was more real, than\nmy parents who had been ripped from my life. \n   I had come to\naccept the fact that, without a past, I could have no future. In order to live\nin the present, I would have to seal away my feelings I had developed for those\nwho did not exist, and put my faith, in a man, who was once deemed, my worst\nenemy. I would have to bury these delusions, in order to save me from myself. \n   Before I could\ndo so, I would have to see my journey out—I would need proof that these places,\nI had never been to, didn’t exist. I would need to die. Only this time, the\ndanger was more evident. The dangerous fact that entailed, I might not be\ncoming back. \n\nMy previously published titles that I will be sending out as rewards. \nMINUS ONE \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBeneath the bonds of twins, lies a lethal jealousy... \nAll of Gwen’s life, she was the outcast. Always failing her classes, sneaking out of the house, she would even steal. She was in a lot of ways, the shadow image of her twin sister Aelinor. Soon, that would all change. The night of their senior prom, they both get into a terrible car crash. Aelinor was killed instantly.Or so Gwen thought... \nWithout hesitation, Gwen takes her sisters place, and the life she always wanted; going as far as to claim her scholarship, and even her boyfriend. Seemingly, her newlife gets off to a good start. Until she starts get threatening letters demanding for her to tell the truth about Aelinor or join her. \nAs time goes on, the letters become more threatening, and the death count of the people she and her twin grew up with, grows. How long can fool everyone she knows? How long can she deceive them into believing Gwen was the one who died, before the person who wrote the letter comes for her?Should she just come clean and go to the police? After all the car crash was an accident...right? \n     Gwen will soon discover that beneath the bonds of twins lies a lethal jealousy, and that some secrets...refuse to stay buried... \n\n NIGHT TERRORS: HALLWAYS & MIRRORS (BOOK 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  A supernatural thriller about a war between the sons and daughters of angels and demons, and a girl who's world is changed forever... \nI would wake up in the middle of the night; a cold sweat drenching my sheets, gasping for air, my hands racing defensively to my throat. In these brief moments that fallowed, I would always realize two things; one: it all had been a nightmare, a terrible nightmare, and two: the three figures standing at the foot of my bed hadn't disappeared with the scenery, they had followed me out.These figures, I knew them too well. Two were men silhouettes and one was female. It wasn't all to surprising how well I knew them, I saw them every night. I would always be running from them in a dark, eerie familiar place. But they would always reach me, pin me down, and begin to choke the life from me. Even after I woke, the pressure around my throat was real and would linger in bruises, and those figures would still be there, staring at me.Doctors called them night terrors. They said they weren't uncommon for children and young teenagers who had recently lost their parents. Only, these started the night of my sixteenth birthday, two weeks before their death. \n\nBelow is a link for one of the reviews I have gotten on this book!http://cozymysterybookreview.com/?p=3841 \n\nNIGHT TERRORS: EYE OF THE LIVING SHADOW (BOOK 2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo dream was safe. Every\nNight Terror I had began to blur with reality until they were no longer\nseparate. In the months that had passed, I was the only one to return. With my\ndeath, I joined a war that lay beneath heaven and above hell, in limbo where people\nbelieved that the living were dead, and they were alive. I had put the people I\nloved most in danger of not only losing their lives, but their souls.\nUnfortunately, evil did not rest while I was away.   Shadows could now cross over\nduring the day, lingering in doorway, mirrors, and no longer seek just us\nguardians. The deaths of mortals are escalating at an alarming rate. With Alex\nstill missing, the race is on to find a way to open a journal the first\nguardian has left behind, and find a way to stop the shadows. Now, I have to\nface the consequences of the deals I’ve made, and meet death, for a second\ntime. \n\nDEAD GIRL HANDS: AWAKENING (BOOK 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerra Wilcox was an average teenager. She had hopes, dreams, a future. One stray bullet changed all that. On the 16th of October, she is caught in the path of a stray bullet, which brings an end to her short lived life. Not long after her death, her school begins to be ravaged by attacks, said to be carried out by an unseen force. Now Amber Bennet must find a way to help the soul of her best friend cross over and to free her of the demon that has possessed her. Before its too late. With the help of Mark Burdett, will true love be enough to bring back Terra from the abyss? Or will everyone she has ever loved, perish under what she has become? \nStretch Goals: \n\n\n\nINTIAL GOAL:$350 \n \n\n \nWith this being reached, this book will have the necessary funds to be published.\n \n    STRECH GOAL:$465 REACHED! \nI would love to get some copy editing done so this book can have that professional touch, In order to do so, this project must reach 465 dollars.

    "textDescription": "Story How much time do you spend on your iPhone or on your Mac? Would you say it’s essential for you? It wakes you up in the morning, it gives you the news, it can pay for your coffee, it helps you get to work, and it enables you to do your work. It connects you with the people who matter most to you. But what if you couldn't do any of those things? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the problem: Disability affects 1 billion people worldwide. That's 1 in 7 people. For these people, the apps we use, the apps that enable us to do more, the apps that let us communicate, are often unusable. My name is Sally Shepard. I’m an iOS developer and accessibility consultant based in London. Over the past six years, I've worked on apps that have been used by hospitals, installed in galleries, and named ‘App of the Year’ by Apple. I speak internationally about accessibility, development, and user experience, and am actively involved in the iOS and Mac development communities. Testing every possible accessibility need is time consuming. If you work in a small team or you're time constrained, how can you do it? What if you could quickly see what's broken or where something could be improved? \nI’ve developed some solutions to speed up accessibility testing, make it part of your workflow and help you better understand the user experience. I’ve called this collection of tools the Inclusive Toolkit. I want these tools to be free for everyone to use—that's where I need your help. By backing this project you're enabling me to build them and provide them free of charge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I want to focus on making apps 'inclusive' rather than just making them 'accessible’. These two words are often used interchangeably, but with 'inclusive’ there’s more emphasis on making something for everyone versus just making something for people with a disability. There are many people who don't identify as having a disability but use and rely on accessibility features. Too often, 'accessibility’ is seen as a feature or user story instead of being something that all features and user stories should have. When we make accessibility a separate feature, it’s very likely to be left behind.\nThe other reason behind using ‘inclusive’ is when you say ‘accessibility’ most developers think of VoiceOver, which is only part of the rich set of features Apple provides. The common difficulties around implementing inclusive concepts in apps are a lack of resources, knowledge and empathy. \nAll of Apple’s products have features that enable inclusivity, and they make a huge difference to people’s lives. Anyone developing for their platforms has access to the APIs to make their app equally accessible.  So how can we fix this?  From a user point of view, I want the Inclusive Toolkit to help solve two problems: unusable elements and poor experiences. And from a developer/designer/QA point of view, I want it to speed up development and testing time, as well as build empathy. It’s great if you work in a company that already has specific resources and knowledge about accessibility—but for many developers, that isn’t the case. I want to provide ways of making it part of the development process instead of something tacked on at the end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inclusive Toolkit aims to cover: Simplifying testing: \nRecreate the UI with 'Visual Voiceover' to reveal each element's accessibility values while hiding elements without accessibility information. \nHighlight 'invisible' UI elements like long animations, unintuitive gestures and complicated view hierarchies. \nHighlight areas of the app that don't handle reduced transparency, dynamic text sizing, and other parts of the Visual Accommodations API. \nAutomate production of text ‘journeys’ through each screen and provide guidance on how to simplify it. \nAutomate output of screenshots of the above. \n Building empathy by simulating impairments: \nProvide recognisable representations of the effects of different impairments. \nSimulate colour blindness. \nSimulate visual impairments. \n Understanding inclusive interfaces: \nBuild inclusive wireframes for the app journey.  \nConsider parallel interfaces for specific needs.  \nUse accessibility APIs effectively. \n Improve effectiveness and timeliness of feedback: \nEmploy accessible methods to request feedback. \nlearn how users can rate an app's inclusiveness that's meaningful to developers and users alike. \n Here are a few initial mockups of some of the tools: \n\n\nVisual VoiceOver—on the left is the original; on the right is a mockup of the output of the Visual VoiceOver tool \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInterface as text—on the left is the original; on the right is the interface displayed as only text \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nColour-blindness test—what the UI looks like through simulations of different types of colour blindness \n \n\n \n\n\nRewards There are many ways you can support the Inclusive Toolkit! There are stickers, t-shirts, a wall of fame, accessibility app reviews and workshops. There is even a hero option where you can donate a workshop to a school or university! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerchandise There are some very awesome stickers, badges, t-shirts, and a wall of fame. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n App reviews Find out how inclusive your app is! I'll review your app, provide screenshots highlighting parts of your app that are inaccessible, and offer steps on how you can improve the experience. Once you fix any issues, I'll carry out a follow-up review to let you know whether the issues are resolved. One app review covers an iPhone, iPad or Mac app. If you have a universal app, you'll need two reviews. The review also covers WatchKit extensions, Today extensions, custom-keyboard extensions, photo-editing extensions, and Apple TV specific UI. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Workshops The workshops are a great opportunity for developers, designers, QAs and companies to get some hands-on experience with accessibility. They also help me gather data on what areas people are struggling with, and they'll help shape future tools. There are a few workshop options: \n\n\n\nWorkshop hero: If you'd like to donate a workshop to a school or university, this is the option for you! You'll also get a t-shirt and some stickers as well as a special place on the wall of fame. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIndividual developers/contractors: If you're a developer, you can get a ticket to attend a one day workshop in London. The workshop will cover the accessibility APIs in iOS and OS X, and we'll talk about how to use them, how to test them and how to think more inclusively. We'll do some hands-on exercises, and you can get help fixing an app you're working on. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies: If you're a company and you have a team of developers/designers/QAs, you can have me come in and do a half-day or full-day workshop, customised for your specific needs. Half-day workshops will cover the accessibility APIs in iOS and OS X, and we'll talk about how to use them, how to test them and how to think more inclusively. Full-day workshops are customisable—each workshop will include what's covered in the half-day workshop plus some other options like a hands-on testing of your app, advice on how you can fix accessibility issues, QA-specific approaches to testing accessibility features, and tips to help you build inclusive empathy within designers and product people. For companies in the UK, if you’re based more than 2 hours outside of London by train—contact me first to discuss travel costs. If you're based outside the UK, I can carry out a virtual workshop for your team—or there are also some shipping options available that will cover travel for me. Get in touch if you have any questions about location or availability.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConference Tickets Support The Inclusive Toolkit while attending some of the best iOS & OS X conferences in the world! There are tickets from 360|iDev, iOSDevUK, NSScotland and Pragma Conference. All of these tickets have been donated, it's really a testament to how wonderful and supportive the community is! 360|iDev - Denver, Colorado USA, August 16th-19th iOSDevUK - Aberystwyth, Wales, 7th-10th of September NSScotland - Edinburgh, Scotland, 24th-25th of October Pragma Conference - Florence, Italy, 10th of October Note: this reward entitles you to a ticket to the conference only, accommodation and travel are not included.  You'll also get a t-shirt, some stickers, badges and a spot on the wall of fame! Timeline The project will be open source, so my progress will be fully visible and contribution and comments will be welcome. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll start work in mid-June, and I'll work through July, August and September. During July and August, I'll hold workshops and carry out accessibility app reviews. I'm aiming to have a testable pre-release by the end of September. I'll review the feedback from the workshops and testing, and I'll be upfront if there may be any potential course-corrections.  The next landmark release will be by the end of October, to potentially coincide with iOS 9 / OS X 10.11. I want this to be an ongoing project with my input and community involvement providing guidance. Stretch goal The Inclusive Toolkit will fill a huge gap in accessibility tools for developers, but the other thing that is lacking is resources. My stretch goal for this project is a book. So, If this project reaches £12,000 then I will write a book about developing inclusive experiences! I’m aiming to produce a digital book since I would hopefully be able to include some interactive code samples and I can do updates to it easily. If the project gets over £12,000 then I can add a print book goal. What would the book cover? The working title for the book is ‘Developing an inclusive experience’. There will be four main parts: How to handle common design patterns There are a lot of common design patterns that don't work well with accessibility, these would be covered with recipie-style solutions. From basics to experience The Inclusive Toolkit will get you to a point where your app is usable with Apple’s Accessibility features but what if you wanted to go beyond the bare minimum? This part of the book would cover adding an inclusive wow-factor. Handling inclusion in games Approaches to alternate controls, implementing the accessibility APIs in SpriteKit and SceneKit, adapting game play, and adapting graphics. (I'm working on running a hackathon in London in October/ November on a similar topic, get in touch if you’d like to be involved) Case Studies Find out what various developers have done to make their app inclusive, what their challenges were and what they’ve learned. Budget I want the Inclusive Toolkit to be free to use so that all iOS and Mac developers can use it. I also want to make this project happen! It takes a lot of time to develop the tools, go through feedback, and add features—and do all of this quickly. I want the Inclusive Toolkit to be maintained for years to come. The budget will be allocated towards:  \nTime—time for me to work on the tools, and carry out workshops and app reviews \nInfrastructure—website and any ongoing costs \nProduction costs for rewards like stickers and t-shirts   \nStretch goal (if met)—writing a book \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want more apps to be inclusive or if you're a developer and you want it to be easier to make your app inclusive, please consider backing my project, the Inclusive Toolkit—let's make apps everyone can use. Thank you! Special thanks to LILYwoot Pictures for making such a wonderful video :) Risks and challenges Possible changes and additions to iOS and OS X after this summer's WWDC may mean I'll have to adjust or expand goals. I’ll be upfront about it if that may be the case. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Fooju is incidental or accidental creative impulses manipulated into performative dance theater that mimics the subconscious of dreams. Incidentally and accidentally developed by Dolo McComb and Adam Robert Dickerson while students at Colorado College, Fooju was something the two could later use to attribute (blame) their consistent aesthetic choices and influences.  Dolo has been living and dancing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while Adam has been living and dancing in Brooklyn, New York. After multiple phone calls and some serious reminiscing, they decided that the audience for their choreography was in New York City. Dolo and Adam have been planning and coordinating this show since the spring, and after rallying dancers, they booked The Martha Graham Studio Theater for a weekend in January. The expenses for the show come down to renting rehearsal space, renting the theater, hiring a lighting designer, costumes, advertising, paying the dancers and other unforeseen expenses. When totals came down to $60 an hour and $200 a night, the Kooky Queen and the Dweeby King quickly new they would need help.  With your profoundly appreciated help, Dolo and Adam plan to use this debut of Fooju Dance Collaborative as a launchpad for what they hope will become a working dance theater company in New York City. Please help them with whatever you can, and let the Fooju spread like mayonnaise. foojudance.com Risks and challenges Our main challenge will be to ensure that we use this show to our advantage: utilize the profits of ticket sales, audience exposure (to create a \"fan base\"), and documentation of the performance toward the growth of Fooju Dance Collaborative. Appropriate funding is required to make this debut something that people will want to see again--we do not intend for this to be a \"one and done\" kind of deal.

Who am I? \n\nI’ve been living in New York for six years and writing songs for most of that time. Little by little, this fun hobby has turned into a full-steam-ahead passion. Music has always been a huge part of my life. My father, an opera singer, used to serenade my pregnant mother with everything from The Beatles to Stevie Wonder to Pavarotti, my little sister also grew into a singer (an amazing one at that), and my mom, well, singing isn’t her forte, but seriously, you should see that woman pick up an accordion. It’s interesting I grew up in such a musical household. And unlikely. I come from a deaf family. Both my grandparents on my father’s side spent their lives without hearing a note of the music their son and grandchildren would create.  I think about that now & then. It helps me not to take things for granted. Especially the experience of listening to and sharing music. That’s why I’m so excited to take these songs that have been rattling in my head like pennies in a tin can and share them with you! What are these songs about? In a word: Love. All sides of it. The promises and the pain. From the buzz in your heart when you first meet that person to the hollow ache in your gut when they’re gone. It’s about embracing the love of the people who care about you and accepting that, sometimes, love is something you can never get back. \n\nThis EP will run the gamut of love, loss and the light at the end of the tunnel. \n What's the sound? Here are some of my tunes. Try them on. 'You Got Love' (Live & acoustic at Madpan Productions, NYC) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n'It's Alright' (Live & acoustic at Madpan Productions, NYC) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'The Ocean' (Demo) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere will the money go?  Great question! After all, these are your hard-earned greenbacks we’re talking about. You want to make sure that they’re living up to their full potential. Your generous donations will go toward things like: \nstudio time \nrenting equipment \nhiring musicians \nmixing & mastering costs \ndesigning album art \ncreating a hardcopy CD \ndistribution of the album  \ncrafting/delivering Kickstarter rewards \n  For an independent artist, these costs can quickly become overwhelming. That’s why your help means so much! Risks and challenges As someone important once said, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained”. Life is risk. And so is a Kickstarter campaign. If our goal isn’t met, no one gets a penny, none of these super cool rewards get sent out, this music never sees the light of day and I live out the rest of my days working the ring-toss as a traveling carny.\n\nAs with anything, there can be unforeseen challenges. That Murphy guy had that law. Hiccups can arise in scheduling, instruments, electronics, etc. Delays can occur anywhere on the production line. Thankfully, I’ve surrounded myself with a great team of people who can help me make sure we overcome any obstacles and put the “chyah!” in challenge. (My friends made me put that in there.)\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out my page. Don't be a stranger! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

At the beginning we faced the problem that most of the people could not imagine how they want to design their jackets.

Gallery's Mission is to advance the status of women artists by exhibiting quality work by a diverse group of women artists and to provide leadership and community to women artists. \n“Since 1972, the trailblazing A.I.R. gallery in New York, the world’s first women’s art co-op, has provided quiet support for those operating outside the art world’s market-obsessed precincts.” - Carey Lovelace, Art in America June/July, 2007 \n“Open A.I.R.” is a recent project of A.I.R. Gallery that invites innovative curatorial ideas from women in various art centered backgrounds. “Open A.I.R.” supports our original mission of advancing the status of women artists. This curatorial call gives self-identified women artists everywhere a chance to realize their artistic vision, when they might not otherwise have a chance to do so it reaches out not only to members of the gallery, but to the whole community. A.I.R. is committed to reaching the diversity of people that reside in New York City as well as across the nation, especially those in communities not always served by the art world mainstream. \nWhere will this project take us? \nAccording to Art Critic Jerry Saltz, 50% of MFA students are women but only 25% of solo exhibits in NYC galleries in 2007 were by women. This fact highlights the need to foster the careers of underrepresented women artists and this is exactly what A.I.R. Gallery is doing through the Open A.I.R. project. \nThe “Open A.I.R.” project was inaugurated last year. This project gives A.I.R. an opportunity to discover innovative curatorial ideas brought to us by diverse women artists. The Gallery mounted exhibition Locks in Translation, a show that explored issues around hair curated by JoAnne McFarland, featuring artists from many varied backgrounds. In addition Feeling What No Longer Is, curated by Serra Sabuncuoglu will be shown at A.I.R. Gallery from April 28th to May 23rd 2010. This show explores art that takes someone from the past and re-imagines them in the present. With further funding for “Open A.I.R.” we will be able to turn this program, which was once only an experiment, into a permanent part of A.I.R. Gallery. Your donation to “Open A.I.R.” gives us a chance to provide the curators with a stipend for organizing such wonderful exhibits as well as supplying increased funds to go toward supporting the show. Your contributions will also make available the tools and resources we need to make the exhibits possible- including gallery hardware, press materials and comprehensive marketing to bring visibility to “Open A.I.R.” and the women who are involved in it. \nTo learn more visit www.airgallery.org Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story The General Idea. I would like for this Batman Zombie animation to spawn a successful online series. I have almost graduated university and it would be good to get something going online that was my own creation. Both Batman and Zombies are very popular themes online at the moment, especially in the lego universe. £200 Total Goal Stretch. I can't believe how fast you all helped me reach my goal! I can now afford to create the full hospital set for the first series that I designed myself. Not only this but I can have more characters, not only more but higher quality, this is fantastic! Unfortunately I had some bad luck with my camera lens and it is now slightly damaged. I can still make the series, I was filming just before I wrote this update. Basically there is a big blue mark appearing in the center of images every time I take a picture. My work around for this is that I can film from more of a distance then just crop the footage in post production, the camera I am using is an amazing piece of equipment, so the image resolution is fine to do this without loosing any quality. I am worried the damage could get worse, as it is basically an issue that has grown(this was a second hand lens to begin with). If I can raise the extra funds I will use them to purchase another lens for the camera which will make filming so much more easy. Examples of my work. Before I get into details, here are two examples of my work so far with Lego. The first video took a single day to make and the second only took 4 or 5 days.  \n\nWhat Will Your Funding Go To?\n \n The funds will be used simply to purchase the required bits and pieces for the film. Example given, a batman lego figure costs around £8. I already have my own camera and equipment to make the film so that's not a problem. I also fully own all the software that is needed. I have enough things to make episode 1 but after that I will hit a brick wall so to speak. Further Details The episodes would be about 150 seconds in length each and special characters from the dc universe would be featured throughout the series. The first series as a test run for popularity would run for 5 episodes. The general outline of the whole thing has been scripted and planned. I actually already have the parts to make episode one. Its more of the series that I will need support to develop until it grows in popularity. I made a Youtube channel only a week ago and already have over 200 subs, so the videos are spreading quite fast for a new youtuber! Would be great to get a new memorable project out there. Risks and challenges I am about to graduate from university and keen to make a name for myself which will keep me motivated to surpass any difficulties. \n\nI have alot of spare time in the next 10 weeks which gives plenty of time to compensate for any setbacks. I believe the first episode will take about 30 hours to film and another 10 to edit. I would like to keep at the ratio of releasing one episode every 2 weeks.\nThe set backs I have encountered in the past are:\nSoftware crashes\nLighting issues (broken or flickering bulbs etc)\nOut of focus shots (would refilm)\nAll of these are simple issues that can occur and I have overcome them.\n \nThe set is fully designed. Once funded the parts will be ordered, there could be a delay with them but that should not be too much hassle and they could be re-ordered and what not.

Once these films and videos are digitized, I will be putting together short films. Little windows into our family. Short documentaries featuring interviews with different family members. Films that explore facets of my life. These films will be available for all to see online. To digitize and preserve these films properly requires expensive equipment and a professional hand, and will take up a bulk of the fund goal. Here is a partial list of what is needed to truly begin this project in earnest. - Digitize and archive over 3,000 feet of 8mm films - Acquire the hardware needed to digitize and preserve the VHS and Hi8 Tapes - Purchase hard drives for storage and archiving - Acquire additional software for proper treatment of the videos - Outsource transcription/translation services - Purchase blu-rays or digital tapes for archiving This project has been weighing on my heart heavily since I was young. It has been difficult to raise funds on my own because of the sheer expense of hard drive space; special hardware needed to digitize the tapes; software to edit; and other odds and ends. Not to mention the time it will take from my life! I'm truly excited about this opportunity, and I thank you for your investment into the preservation of my family's history. Risks and challenges I have already begun the long process of digitizing the VHS and Hi8 tapes we have. I realized quickly that two of the larger issues pertain to proper storage and archiving, as well as documenting and sorting the footage. \n\nOnce everything is digitized, it will take quite a bit of time and energy to properly notate and store all the footage. While the videos themselves are full of fun and insightful moments, to edit them down into substantial pieces (as opposed to mere clips) will require additional filming in the form of interviews with family members, possible writing of voiceovers, collecting additional stories from my youth, and edit time.\n\nThis is not a project with a set end date. I intend this to be a lifelong project. It will be a constant, ever changing series. As I finish one video, I will move to another. Eventually creating new content. In a way, I am the keeper of our families memories, and I take that task to heart. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Yet, when we are ready for sound to entertain us, we’re left wanting. Details are missing. The natural sounds of instruments are lost. Dialog is compressed and unintelligible. At the same time, it’s difficult to set up surround sound systems in large city apartments, homes, bedrooms, and dorm rooms. XPUMP transforms any pair of stereo speakers into a virtual home theater sound system Powered by Embrace Audio Lab’s patented XROUND™ digital signal processing algorithm, XPUMP is designed to unleash immersive sound for all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP utilizes a patented digital signal processing algorithm called XROUND to transform flat stereo sound into an immersive three dimensional experience. XROUND works in real-time, extending the width and depth of the audio signal coming from your favorite game, movie, or music.\n \n\n\n\n\nXPUMP delivers greater detail and excitement to whatever you’re hear \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP is a gum-stick sized device that is amazing through speakers (home, desktop or portable) or headphones. You simply add XPUMP between your device (computer, television, gaming console, mobile) and the output (speakers or headphones) and press play. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, Movie Lovers! XPUMP works every micro-second to enhance every audio detail, bringing you an immersive sound experience without buying expensive new equipment or spending days running wires and installing speakers. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP \nPumps new life into your audio equipment for cinematic entertainment  \nExpands the “sweet spot” of stereo listening into a “sweet area” for a more stunning experience  \n Hey, Gamers! \nXPUMP immerses you in your favorite game by enhancing the detail of every sound effect and deepening every sound environment. XPUMP boosts the sound field from your stereo speakers up to 200 percent, giving you an entirely new experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP  \n\nBreaks down and boosts individual element details like voices, footsteps, drum beats, and musical instruments  \nIncreases sound localization so you can hear your enemies before you see them \n \n\n XPUMP on the Go! \nBring immersive sound with you wherever you go!  The gum-stick sized XPUMP is easy to slip into any pocket, boosting details and adding depth to anything you’re listening to or watching on your mobile device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP \n\nIs pocket-sized, light to carry and upgrades any set of headphones \nGreat for any genre of music \n \n\nIt's This Easy! \nPlug and play.

Our DSP and science needs to be processed and reconstructed in real space as it cannot be recorded by microphone. This video is just a proof of functionality, but is not for illustration of the real hearing experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the science behind XROUND™ and XPUMP: \nSpherical Sound Field Expansion Technology multiplies the stereo sound field by 200 percent while enhancing signal depth, width, and detail. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic EQ that automatically adjusts according to audio detail and sound field for optimal audio presentation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Detail Boosting happens because the XROUND algorithm runs on a dedicated dual core processor at the clock speed of 55.3 MHz, meaning it’s working every microsecond. The audio boosting processor unleashes directional cues and hidden audio elements to deliver a totally immersive experience.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychoacoustic Bass Enhancement increases the perception of bass frequencies, even on smaller speakers and headphones. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP has been in development for years. The team at Embrace Audio Lab have been constantly designing and refining the performance, look, and feel of this pocket-sized, light, portable device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve honed the product so that it’s easy to use, simple, and beautiful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPARISON \n\n\n\nClick to see the larger picture \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPUMP has gone around the world this past year.

    "textDescription": "Story Paine’s Park will be one of the country’s next great skate plazas, and the keystone to Franklin’s Paine Skatepark Fund ’s master plan for Philadelphia skateboarding. Yes, Paine’s Park will be a skatepark, but more accurately, it will be a public place for skateboarding . Skateparks are often designed exclusively for skaters, but a public place for skateboarding aims to welcome skateboarding into multi-purpose public space and celebrate this integration. Having sparked a new type of dialogue between the skateboarding community, the City of Philadelphia and members of the design community, this project is emblematic of a vibrant city with rich cultural heritage and a promising future where space is designed to accommodate skateboarding as an important energizing force behind the life and movement of public space.  \n\n\nPaine's Park Rendering \n \n\n \n\nPhiladelphia is known all around the world for our long and storied history of skateboarding. However, Philadelphia is very underserved in terms of free, designated skateparks. The ratio of skaters to skateparks in Philadelphia hovers around 15,000:1 compared to basketball, for example, which is much better accommodated at 211:1. Franklin’s Paine Skatepark Fund is actively working to close this gap between skaters and facilities and completing Paine’s Park is integral to this plan, as it will serve as a hub for skating in Philadelphia, both to local skaters, and those who come to visit our city from afar. \n\n\nPaine's Park Construction Progress \n \n\n \n\nIn order to ensure that the park opens by this summer, we at Franklin’s Paine Skatepark Fund, need two things – decent weather, and final assorted project fees. Quite honestly, it’s very difficult to complete a $4.5 million dollar park and, of course, unexpected issues often arise during a construction process that can add to a project's overall cost. We have raised support from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, the Tony Hawk Foundation , the Olitsky Family Foundation and countless individual contributors over the years and we are so grateful for this support. Through this Kickstarter campaign, we are now raising funds to close our final gap and finish the park in time for the summer. After over a decade of hard work and perseverance, we are thrilled to be this close to opening one of Philadelphia’s next great civic spaces, and one of the country’s next great skateparks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome amazing local partners have stepped up to support this campaign, including Todd Carmichael, CEO & Co-Founder of La Colombe Torrefaction and star of Travel Channel’s Dangerous Grounds; Lorenzo Errico, Founder of Formation Skateboard Company ; Ishod Wair, local professional skateboarder; artists Todd Marrone, Yis “NoseGo” Goodwin, and Todd Landaker, and Skout Media who produced our campaign video. We are so grateful for their support and are siked on the amazing original artwork that we have to offer exclusively to our kickstarter backers through these partnerships in the form of stickers, t-shirts and skate decks. \n\n\nOnce Upon A Time Graphic - Art by NoseGo \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nBentaur Graphic - Art by Todd Marrone \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFranklin's Paine Sticker - Art by Todd Landaker \n \n\n \n\nThis project has been a long time coming. We have spent over a decade working to raise funds, seek City and State approvals, match our design aspirations with our budget, and pull together all of the moving pieces associated with developing a major capital project on public land. After years of perseverance and dedication, we finally broke ground in October of 2012 and need one final push to complete the park in time for a summer 2013 opening. Let’s finish this right and then we will welcome the world to come skate Paine’s. Risks and challenges Large capital projects often produce unforeseeable curveballs along the way, but we feel that we are far enough along with construction at this point to have uncovered all of our major project cost implications. If any additional issues arise on the construction site between now and completion, we feel confident that our project team will be able to persevere and work through any concerns along with our partners from the City of Philadelphia. \n\nPost-construction, the largest challenge will be maintenance costs and upkeep of the park. To this end, any funds raised in excess of our $10,000 goal will support maintenance and programming costs moving forward. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textLength": 2465,
    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest title from Kinetic Press, Westward  is a new steampunk mystery comic from writer/illustrator Ken Krekeler, author of Dry Spell  and The Colodin Project . The story is told over the course of 10 issues, played against a Victorian/Deco background of corporate espionage and technological revolution. Westward #8 is listed in the June issue of Previews (under Tool Publications) and will be distributed through Diamond in August of 2014. The goal of this campaign is to secure funding for printing, shipping and distribution of Westward #8. The money raised from this campaign goes toward production costs. If we exceed that cost, the remaining balance will be put toward the campaign's Stretch Goals, inflating the rewards for all backers across the board who pledge $20 or more. Depending on pre-order sales, the cost of publishing a limited print run for each issue of Westward is typically around $2000. Shipping usually amounts to $500. And then, of course, you have to factor in the production and shipping of the Kickstarter Rewards themselves, which usually amounts to 10% of funds raised.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________ STEAM T.V.___________ Westward has always been almost exclusively funded by Kickstarter. The following videos below were produced for previous Westward KS campaigns, including trailers that help illustrate the quality, plots, tones and themes of the the book. You'll also find featuring behind-the-scenes documentary footage of the people who help make the series possible.

It's a very good comic.” -InsidePulse.com (Full review ) Risks and challenges The biggest challenge in the success of this campaign is the same challenge I face with every comic I've ever produced: marketing, exposure, and awareness. Every artist has their weaknesses; mine has always been publicity. Outside of animated trailers, preview pages and comic cons, I've always lacked the salesmanship necessary to communicate my ideas properly in a way that catches the public eye.

    "textDescription": "Story Hey! My name is Gideon Roberts.  I'm twelve. I asked my dad to help me do this Kickstarter project because I was too young. He gets all of the legal responsibility and I get all the money! It's a win-win! Several months ago I became very interested in blacksmithing and I even took a few classes on it! However, I couldn't practice what I was learning because I didn't have a forge at home. We didn't have enough money to buy all the equipment, but my dad has been helping me build our own blacksmith forge from recycled junk! We made the forge out of an old BBQ, brake drum, and a bathroom fan. It works really pretty well! We found some old tools at some yard sales and antique shops. So far so good! We couldn't afford a real anvil, but my Uncle Craig was nice enough to come down here with a big, thick piece of steel for us to pound on in place of an anvil. It works OK, but it doesn't have a horn or hardy hole (what we need so we can curve things and split things, etc.) That's what this Kickstarter project is for! Anvils and other blacksmithing equipment are expensive, but if we can buy even a small anvil (at least 125 pounds or so) to get started, along with some tongs, hardy tools and other blacksmithing tools that we need, then we can really get Gideon's Forge off the ground and running! I've already learned how to make a few things. Here is a picture of a few things I've been making in my lessons with Jarom Rush, and I am more than willing to make my artistic metal creations for you in exchange for your financial support! See my list of rewards for more information. Here are the items I hope to be able to buy with your help. The anvil could take most or even all of the money, but I'm hoping I can find a used, modestly priced, good quality anvil with some money left over for a few of the other items: \n125+ pound, high quality anvil \nTongs (several pair, preferably) \nHardy tools (to help cut, punch and shape the metal) \nSteel rods and bars, and coke for fuel. \n \n If I make more than my original goal, I have also made some stretch goals: STRETCH GOALS $1300 - I will hold an open house at Gideon's Forge where everyone who gave $25 or more can come visit and eat refreshments! $1800 - I will write an epic song of gratitude with my dad and make a YouTube video out of it. And dedicate it to you. Yes, YOU.  I will play my ukulele and my dad will sing. Risks and challenges I'm a complete noob. Let's just say it how it is. I'm a 12-year-old with very little experience. What could possibly go wrong? Right?\n\nThat said, I think my rewards are fairly realistic, with many of them not depending on my skill. Also, my dad says he is willing to help me whenever possible. For those rewards that do involve my own personal craftsmanship, all I can promise is to do my 12-year-old best. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

With these extra funds, we can afford: \nBetter equipment (a nicer dolly, new mics, etc.) \nA score to be composed to the film \nCompensation of collaborators  \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE STORY: Meet Sam: 20 years old. Artistic. Passionate. Introverted. Developing Schizophrenia. Sam's story begins on his move to Austin, Texas. A burgeoning painter, Sam soon presents his first full collection in a gallery. Everything seems to be going Sam's way. That is, until he begins hearing the voices. Throughout the accelerating collapse of Sam's life, relationships take a front seat. Halfway through the film, a revolutionizing secret about Devin, Sam's brotherly yet guarded roommate, is revealed, drastically changing the nature of his relationship with Sam. Meanwhile, Sam quickly falls in love with Belle, a free-spirited, caring woman who is new to town.  As Sam's condition worsens, Sam is sucked further and further into his mind and is finally forced to asked himself - what is real? In many ways, it is Sam's passion - both for art and love - that saves him. The film concludes with Sam finally completing a painting he has been struggling with for months (\"Belleflower\"). \n\n\nCharacter Sketches of Devin, Belle, and Sam (from L to R) \n \n\n \nBelleflower is a story about relationships -  about love and loneliness, passion and anger, elation and sadness, reality and hallucination. More than anything, Belleflower  is a story about humanity and we hope you will help us tell it. THE BUDGET: Feature films aren't cheap. That's where YOU come in! When you support Belleflower by donating, we can afford: \nBeautiful sets and props  \nCostumes and specialty make-up  \nFeeding our wonderful cast and crew  \nFilming location costs \n \nAny extra film equipment we don't already have  \n Without your help, none of this can happen . So, please become a part of our project by donating and help make this vision a reality! THE CREW: Brian Ruliffson (Writer/Director/Cinematographer) \n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Ruliffson was born and raised in Austin, Texas and studies Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Brian's been making short films since high school and is thrilled to dive into making his first feature length film. Laura Austin (Writer/Director/Producer) \n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Austin is an Austin native who currently studies Human Biology at Stanford University in California. She was very active in her high school theatre program and is excited to translate her experience surrounding the stage to working behind a camera. THE CAST: Patrick Delgado (Sam) \n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Delgado is a talented local actor whose previously starred as Paul in My Sucky Teen Romance . Patrick is majoring in Biology and minoring in Chemistry at Texas State University and hopes to one day be a teacher. Ronan Melomo (Devin) \n\n\n\n\n\nRonan Melomo is an incoming freshman at NYU's acting program in the Stella Adler studio of acting. He has performed in stage roles such as D'mitry in The Brothers Karamazov and Raoul in The Phantom of the Opera. Belleflower will be his first feature length film. Georgia McLeland (Belle) \n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia McLeland studies Geology at Oberlin College. Georgia has performed extensively in the theatre and debuted professionally as Thomasina in Austin Shakespeare's 2012 production of Arcadia . Risks and challenges As with the making of any film, there is risk involved. Our largest challenges will be securing filming locations, finishing filming within our planned days and having the final cut done by mid-July to submit to AFF. We believe that detailed planning will help us avoid these potential future challenges. We're hard at work scouting for crew and locations, and creating a feasible shot plan so that when we get to June, all we'll have to do is press record.

    "textDescription": "Story UPDATE #2: FUNDED! Let's take this bus to school! For every $500 above our original goal, we're going to take the Bicycle Bus on a field trip to a local school. UPDATE #1:  Almost there!!  And a Reward Update Joel Anderson has agreed to do our reward posters as a part of his 'Spirit of Nashville' series!!  What is the Bicycle Bus?  The bicycle bus is a collaborative art project between local artist Andee Rudloff , Green Fleet Bicycle Tours & Rentals , the Metro Parks Department, and the Arts and Business Council of Greater Nashville . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is to transform a school bus into a community mural called the Bicycle Bus. The bus, a 1995 Genesis, is currently being turned into a mobile bicycle rental facility that will park each day underneath the Shelby Street Pedestrian Bridge.  \nThe space underneath the Pedestrian Bridge was previously vacant and underutilized. Green Fleet Bicycle Tours & Rentals has partnered with Metro Parks Department to transform the space into a destination for people who want to explore Nashville by bike.  \nThe finished bus will have hardwood floors, retail displays, and facilities for up to 30 rental bicycles. \nWhy should I support this project?  Art changes \nattitudes, inspires creativity, and brings communities together. We \nthink having an artistic focal point for bicycles in the heart of \ndowntown can help transform the way that people think about bicycles in \nNashville. \n\nThe bicycle bus will increase access to bicycles, introduce new \naudiences to bicycling, and assist city-wide initiatives to promote \nactive living through cycling. \n \n\nAs an art project, the Bicycle Bus will be one \nof a kind - a visual invitation for people to explore Nashville by bike.\n As a cycling resource, the Bicycle Bus will make Nashville more \nbicycle-friendly. \n \nWhat is a community mural?  \nDevised to remind individuals that 'art is for everyone,' a community mural is a community-based visual art project. Designed by professional artist and painted with the help of volunteers, the art is a collaborative effort.  \nAn early adapter of this style, local artist Andee Rudloff has spent her entire career focusing on this type of community art.\nWe feel that Andee’s style of creation is the perfect way to promote cycling in Nashville. We want to remind people that just like art, bikes are for everyone.\n \nA time lapse video of one of Andee's past community murals:  \n\n\n\n\nWhy does it cost so much? \nPainting a bus is laborious and the materials are expensive.  Andee estimates that the community mural will cost about $4,500.  \nThe paint, a high quality metallic, will cost about $2,500.  This paint will last much longer than lower cost alternatives. An estimated $500 will go toward materials (paint, equipment, etc). The remaining $1,500 will cover Andee's time and expertise to facilitate the project.  \nThe entire project will take about 2 weeks to complete with a team of community volunteers.  \n Risks and challenges Without funding, we will not be able to commission Andee to complete this project.\n\nIf successful in funding, the risks are very low. Andee has already created time in her schedule and we have all approvals and partnerships in place to complete this project. \n\nThe only thing that would effect the time frame would be a delay in painting due to weather.

The things we do for Max! Now, rather than sit around waiting for somebody to buy my first book, it's time to get started on a new project.  I think this will wind up a novel, but who can say for sure? It will totally involve Max--or Henry--my dynamo son with autism. The project will without a doubt have something to do with his love of radio stations, strip malls, and pizza. But I really hope to get inside that magnificent brain of his and see what's up. Pace around a little. Have a slice of pizza. Watch a video clip over and over and over again. Funds will pay for lodging and gas for a road trip. The trip will inform the story, which itself will be a road story with an autistic person and a sibling. I'm not trying to be cagey with the details here, comrades. There is simply no benefit to committing to anything here. The story or whatever will unfold exactly as it should. Please help out with this project as you can. This is more than just a fun trip for somebody you probably adore, but it will have the added benefit of being exactly that. And research.  Risks and challenges We may, of course, get stuck at any number of thrift stores.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlory of the Three Kingdoms (GOTK) is a living \ndeck-building game (LDBG) in which each player leads a faction in the Three Kingdoms period and battles for a total victory or the most victory points. The Guandu Core Set comes with a two factions: Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. Each faction begins with a unique starting deck of hero, unit and gold cards that are used to acquire additional resources, military and strategy cards from the province during the game. Some cards also provide victory points for endgame scoring. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOTK wouldn't be a game of the Three Kingdoms if it didn't have a real battle. On each turn, a player may declare a battle action which is resolved in five phases: Declaration, Marshalling, Formation, Engagement and Resolution. Tactic cards may also be used once per phase. Once the target player accepts the challenge, the battle begins and both players draw additional cards accordingly. In the beginning of the Formation phase, each player secretly deploys military cards, possibly with one item card. Deployed cards are then revealed simultaneously and units are grouped by unit type. A unit group may upgrade to veteran status and master status with corresponding hero and unit cards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total strength of each unit group is quickly calculated and the  attacking player is now ready to engage ... At the end of each battle, the victor takes a Glory \ntoken from the defeated player and may also capture and recruit the defeated hero – or have him \nbeheaded (not tear up the card, just remove it from the game). \n\nWhen two out of four card decks in the province are depleted or one faction acquired six Tiger Tally cards, the game ends and the \nplayer with the most victory points wins. However, if one faction acquired all of an opponent's Glory during the game, the \ngame ends immediately and the acquiring faction wins. *** Not your typical Deck Builder, Glory of the Three Kingdoms is an aggressive wargame. Fast and furious, it rewards shrewd strategy and delivers quick tactical combat results. -- Patrick Stevens of Numbskull Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlory of the Three Kingdoms (GOTK) is the fourth deck-building game (DBG) we have designed. The goal was to design a battle-driven war campaign card game where each player controls a faction of the Three Kingdoms. In the game, players interact regularly in turns and fight strategically with units deployed and engaged in the battlefield. It is definitely NOT one of the other card-buying and VP collecting deck-building games (DBG). With that in mind, we put together a large-scale blueprint and designed several battle scenarios, timeline events, a small economic system, a unit advantage system, the Tiger Tally / Glory / Moral VP system and other components for each of the three major battles of the Three Kingdoms. The three major battles are commonly known as Guandu, Chibi (Red Cliffs) and Yiling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA card-draft sorting system was also used in GOTK, as well as in our third DBG, Shadow Masters. It is a system we really like and often integrate into a DBG that uses a medium- to large-size central deck (Note: the card-draft sorting system is not used in the 5th DBG uSpy and the 6th DBG Sub Commanders). \n\nHow should we introduce a large-scale GOTK game system to the market? After countless of discussions, we decided to launch the Guandu Core Set, an affordable two player package with the Yuan Shao and Cao Cao factions, the two main forces that fought during Guandu. Three to four players can also battle in teams of two or individually with two packages of the Guandu Core Set. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in 2013, a Guandu Faction Expansion will be introduced with Liu Bei and Lv Bu factions, plus new game elements such as Morale and Barracks. Next is  the Guandu Scenario Expansion and that is followed by the second major battle - Chibi or Red Cliffs. In the Chibi Core Set, ships and sea battles will come-in ... hmmm, that is all we can tell you for now and we'll let you know more about the Chibi Core Set by the end of 2013 and Yiling Core Set by the end of 2014 :) As you see, we want players to experience the history of the Three Kingdoms in a series of battle-driven strategy game expansions. Hopefully, by year 2015, players are able to enjoy the entire Glory of the Three Kingdoms and play through three major battles in a scheduled timeline of the real events. But first, we need your support to back us on Kickstarter. Overview 1/2 \nOverview 2/2 \nRules (prototype version E23) http://sunrisetornado.com/gotk/rules/GOTK_e23_english.pdf \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a striving and dedicated small board game publisher, we need your support to bring the Guandu Core Set to life. A goal of $7000 would cover part of the printing cost. We will cover rests of \nthat cost and illustration and transportation expenses to print 500 copies and ensure the game gets out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also offer levels of stretch goals and rewards because we do appreciate your effort and support to make the GOTK: Guandu Core Set a success. And with more funding, we can increase the print quantity and lower the cost plus pay for more illustrations on the stretch rewards. Ultimately, it is a glory for all of us! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlory of the Three Kingdoms comes with two different packages on Kickstarter: a Tuck Box Edition and a Deluxe Edition. Tuck Box Edition - The Tuck Box Edition comes with 96 cards and over 30 unique and beautiful illustrations. It is mainly for players who plan to travel with GOTK or play during a short lunch break at work. It is a fast-paced strategy card game that everyone can enjoy. The retail price is \n$18 each. Deluxe Edition - The gorgeous Deluxe Edition \nalso comes with 96 cards and  over 30 unique and beautiful illustrations. In addition, it is packaged in a regular board game box with extra space for expansions and add-ons. It also includes two player boards, six Glory tokens and eight six-side dice. The retail price is $25 each. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach copy of GOTK backed on Kickstarter comes with exclusive and limited reward(s) not available else where ...  Tuck Box Edition :1) Kickstarter Exclusive Starting Player Card2) Kickstarter Exclusive Starting Player Marker, except Footman level Deluxe Edition :1) Kickstarter Exclusive Starting Player Card2) Kickstarter Exclusive Starting Player Marker3) Limited Edition Taoyuan Hero Expansion (See Add-Ons) Starting Player Marker (Kickstarter Exclusive) - The marker is \nincluded in every GOTK: Guandu Core Set Tuck Box Edition (except Footman level) and Deluxe \nEdition on Kickstarter and is made of a ceramic poker chip.

In Three Kingdoms history, during the early \nperiod of the Guandu battle, three Taoyuan brothers weren't yet united for their epic venture in the Three Kingdoms. Therefore, in the design of the Taoyuan Hero\n Expansion, their cards will be drafted from the province and can be acquired by \nany one of the Yuan Shao and Cao Cao factions.

BGG: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39375/the-battle-of-red-cliffs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to co-designers Jerry Gu and Monica Liang, who showed amazing devotion and dedication in partnering with me on this design. I'm looking forward to our epic venture in Chibi and Yiling, the next two major battles of the Three Kingdoms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Seth Jaffee, designer of Eminent Domain, for his suggestions to  make GOTK a more player-friendly and much better game :) Seth is a super-fast and awesome gamer and designer, DBG expert and enthusiastic. It was a great honor to playtest the GOTK Guandu Core Set with Seth at Strategicon Gateway 2012. Thank you Seth! \nThanks to E.R. Burgess of Boardgame Babylon who has always been a great friend and supporter. Thank you for all of your contribution to Sunrise Tornado Game Studio. And to everyone who had playtested with us and purchased the GOTK E22 and e23 prototypes. Finally to backers of Di Renjie, The Battle of Red Cliffs and Glory of the Three Kingdoms, thank you for making the impossible turn into a dream come true :) Risks and challenges The three areas that give me the greatest concern to complete the project on time are ilustration, graphic design and production.\n\nAs of now, 80% of the illustration are done. Once we know what stretch rewards are needed, we will begin to work on the remaining illustration. We are likely to finish the remaining 20% of the illustration in 1-2 months but with unexpected delay, it might take another two months to complete.\n\nThe illustration is done by a professional team of illustrators. Since we are not depending the entire project on just one person, we should be able to complete the illustration on time.\n\nMy second concern is the graphic design. I am personally doing all the graphic design for the project. So far, I heard a lot of positive feedback on the cards but I want them to be even better. That is why they are described as \"DRAFT\" on Kickstarter right now.\n\nI am pretty sure I can finish them within 2-3 months. However, there might be a chance of a delay on the rulebook. After a graphic color draft is done, we will send it to a lot of people to review for graphic layout and a lot of time will be spent on feedback and discussion. Since I have done graphic design for more than 10 game rules, the chance of delay should be minimum.\n\nThe final concern is production. In past, I have worked for a printer in China for two years and I know that anything can happen. Since I have printed many games in China, I know many printers and know what are their strength and weakness. So when I print a game, I select a printer based on their strenght, not the cost. Trust me, that is very important.\n\nOnce the game is printed, we have one thing left to do - delivery. On my first Kickstarter project, Di Renjie, the game was produced on time and 20% of the backers also received their rewards on time BUT because of my stupid ideas, 50% of the backers received their rewards one month later. Remaining 20% were three months late and final 10% were four months late.\n\nNumber 1 mistake I made was to ship by the rewards by China post and it took 8-10 weeks to deliver to some countries such as Columbia. \n\nNumber 2 mistake I made was I DHL US backers' rewards to US than attempted to distribute them from US. Unfortunately, DHL lost my box and I didn't ship enough. Due to poor coordination of resupply, remaining backers received their rewards much later.\n\nThat was a nightmare for everyone. \n\nSo in the future, I will ship all rewards to US first than distribute them all together.\n\nWith these concerns in mind, we will be extra careful and be sure to deliver quality products to backers on time.\n\nThank you for reading and if you have any concern, please feel free to send me a message.\n\nBest regards,\nTa-Te Wu Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Risks and challenges Countless hours of designing, prototyping and testings have lead to the Chill Puck you see today. We've gone through multiple expensive molds perfecting the puck and we've locked in production of the puck and the bands. All we are waiting on is the Kickstarter Community to make our dream a reality. \n\nOur biggest challenge will be packing and shipping our first orders. Chill Pucks are small and cheap, so we are hoping to sell a lot of them. That means our house will turn into a post office when the shipment arrives and the chaos will ensue. We have added an extra month for delivery as a buffer so any delays in the supply chain shouldn't be an issue, but we are expecting to mail billions of them 30 days after Kickstarter ends.

It will be situated in our unique larch-clad studio building, nestled in the wild northern landscape of the Isle of Skye, off the north-west coast of Scotland. Focusing on contemporary art & specialising in the best seasonal coffee beans from around the world, this is going to be a destination place like no other. It will be a welcoming place for people to rest and refresh, a place to view & buy artworks, sample & enjoy coffee, meet old friends, make new ones, chill out, heat up, shelter from the weather, soak up the spectacular views, spot wildlife & linger a while. It will be accessible & inclusive to all - locals & visitors, walkers & talkers, hikers & bikers! \n\n\nThe Magical Isle of Skye \n \n\n \nArt Our work is influenced by our extraordinary natural surroundings, and our experiences of being in Skye's incredible landscape. We express this through paintings, printmaking, drawing, mixed media, and working with natural materials such as driftwood and found objects from the seashore. We have both exhibited and sold our work in Australia and Scotland, and are excited about this next step in our creative careers. We will be selling a wide range of ever-changing artworks such as original paintings, prints, cards, postcards & notebooks to suit all budgets. We would also like to hold special exhibitions & events, & eventually offer community workshops & art retreats to help others to discover & express their creativity. .  \n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee We are passionate about great coffee! Having experienced and worked in Australian cafes, where the production of excellent coffee is taken very seriously, we know what it takes to create the perfect cup. We are delighted to be able to serve a wide range of seasonal coffee from around the world, roasted in Scotland by the award winning Artisan Roast. They are a passionate and dedicated team of coffee experts who work closely with their growers, cultivating long-term relationships & ensuring sustainability, high ethical standards & superior quality. Artisan Roast will enable us to bring an exceptional coffee experience to our community on the Isle of Skye, as well as the many visitors to the island each year. We will create a coffee club, tasting events & coffee courses. A wide selection of freshly-ground beans will also be available to take away. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Isle of Skye's largest source of income is from tourism, of which scenic and cultural experiences, food and drink, are the most popular activities. With the fantastic response already shown since the building of our home and studio was featured on the Channel 4 TV programme 'Grand Designs' , we believe our gallery & espresso bar can meet the demand from locals and tourists alike for a quality art/coffee experience in the wilds of Skye. This will in turn make a valuable contribution to the economic & cultural growth of the island, and help create a sustainable economy in this fragile place. Where you come in... The studio in which we will create the gallery & espresso bar has been built & finished to a basic level inside. We've begun the rest of the work, collecting reclaimed wood from old pallets to clad the interior walls & getting ready for the final fittings. We have done most of the 'green parking' ourselves, laying recycled ground reinforcement to help protect the grass. But there are still some things that we need to raise funds for. \n\n\nthe building \n \n\n \n£9900 is the minimum we need to open & will allow us to  pay for: \nart, framing & display materials  \na good second hand coffee machine \ngrinders, barista equipment & crockery \nseating & furniture \nan electrician & plumber to fit the hot water supply & bathroom facilities.  \n Stretch Goals If we exceed our target, we could also: \nbuy an oven so we can make our own tasty treats. \nbuy a brand new coffee machine which will give us much needed reliability in this remote location. \nfit a cosy woodburner \nhire local staff \n Fantastic Rewards! As a way of showing our eternal and deepest thanks for your support, we are delighted to offer you the following rewards in the shape of cards, notebooks, and prints featuring reproductions of our original artworks, as well as an exclusive selection of original paintings.

Credits Thanks to Kai Westwell for the great video editing and help with the launch, to Jahzzar for the track 'Bed' (http://betterwithmusic.com ), and Kevin McLeod for the track 'Acid Jazz' (http://incompetech.com ) Risks and challenges Through the experience of making our home and studio a reality, we are keenly aware of what is required to make big dreams come to life. We are passionate about our ideas and we are hard-working. We have scrimped, saved and sacrificed, working long days and nights and we know we can make our project succeed.\nAssuming that we will reach the target, what are the challenges we face? Well, things can take a bit longer here & so we are reducing our chances of delays by being highly organised. We have tradesmen lined up, orders ready & suppliers waiting. We aim to be up & running by March for the main tourist season, but would love to be open to serve our local community before then.\nAnd the risks? What if we fail to reach our target? If this happens we will not give up! We will continue to work hard until we achieve our dream. It will take us a lot longer to raise the funds but we will eventually open 'Single Track gallery & espresso bar'. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story You made this possible! Thank you to all of our backers! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kickstarter for IN THE LOOP is over, but keep in the loop at www.intheloopgames.com . Come join us! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot off the press: Circulate News Finger Lakes Times \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The voyage of discovery lies in not seeking new horizons but seeing with new eyes.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociety faces some pretty big challenges such as extreme price fluctuations of raw materials, questions of energy security, and climate change.  Does our current focus allow us to solve these problems effectively? Maybe we’re inclined to label things too fast and think of challenges as only political, environmental, social, or economic affairs. Through the lens of materials and their consumption, IN THE LOOP illustrates how these views intersect and sets out to encourage thinking about today's challenges from a new angle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE LOOP is a game that allows a glance through the macroscope*.   IN THE LOOP uses game-based learning techniques to illustrate the interconnectedness of today's society by combing different approaches to today's resource use into one broader perspective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE LOOP began two years ago while I was working on my Master's in Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology and researching critical raw materials. Digging deeper, I found it to be a very abstract and complex topic that is connected to many other global issues. I needed a tangible way to explain to others what I was working on. I saw how effective games are at illustrating topics in a fun and engaging way. Games let you try out scenarios with little risk - such as putting yourself in the role of CEO without the worry of losing billions. So, I began designing IN THE LOOP. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past two years the game has quickly evolved and proved to have broader applications - from professional development workshops and secondary school education, to university electives and even at-home play. Many I’ve encountered have said it’s the 21st century version of the property trading game you probably played as a kid. (Although IN THE LOOP is faster!) \n\n\n\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation team gets in the loop (left) and playing with my team at Circle Economy (right). \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMBA students from Politecnico di Milano's Business School (MIP) during a week-long circular economy course \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nA memorable session for these workshop attendees! \n \n\n \n\n\nDon't just take it from me.  Here's what those who've played the game are saying: “The game is designed in a very intelligent way as it helped us in changing our thought process from atomistic to holistic. I went through an amazing experience. It will definitely be remembered from our course.”  - Helene E., Production Engineering Student \"After a long presentation, I was happy to play IN THE LOOP and see everyone energetic and interested! Not only does it provide really nice insights and great segways to discussion points, it can be a great icebreaker .\" - Pieter V., Strategy & Management Consultant \"I n an easy and fun way, one gets to know the complexity of materials, products, supply chains, economics, and business strategies. I didn't think about using a game before, but after playing, I see they can be invaluable. \"  - Christa D., Education Coordinator “Playing IN THE LOOP is the most effective way I’ve seen of getting people to understand why the Circular Economy is so important. ” - David P., Assistant Professor, Industrial Design Engineering \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to play as a group?  It's possible to play with large groups using multiple game sets. For this, we have created a digital Events platform that can easily present the timed events to the entire group. [See the IN THE LOOP FACILITATOR reward for access to this digital Events platform.] \n\n\n\n\nDetails, details, details! \n \n\n \n\n\nCurious to know more about how it works?  Visit our website for more detailed information on gameplay.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction Engineers at Chalmers get in the loop. \n \n\n \n\n\nAfter countless loops around the board, playing in the US and all over Europe, and numerous requests for more copies, we're only missing one key player: you!   With your support, we'll gather enough pre-orders so that we can finally print IN THE LOOP large scale and get the game into your hands.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial offers for our Kickstarter Backers: \n\nSpecial licensing - To thank you for joining us on this journey, we've decided to release all games sold through Kickstarter under a special license.  This Kickstarter Limited Edition version means there won't be restrictions on how you use the game.  After the campaign various licenses of the game (and pricing) will be released dependent on end usage (find out more here ). \n\nEarly shipment - IN THE LOOP is expected to be available to the general public in April 2016, but we'll make sure you'll receive it before anyone else. (For Kickstarter backers, the expected date is January 2016.) \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE LOOP started when I was a graduate student over two years ago, and I continued working on it after graduation.  The continuous positive feedback as it was played in the US and across Europe has led me to take action to make large-scale production possible! As Kickstarter has an 'All or Nothing Policy', if this campaign does not hit the minimum of $10,000 by the deadline, then IN THE LOOP won't receive any of your pledged contributions (and you won't be charged). So, if you too can't wait to get IN THE LOOP, please share this campaign! - Katie katie@intheloopgames.com Website   |   Facebook    |   Twitter       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Inspired by Joel de Rosnay's The Macroscope .  As he describes in his book: \"The microscope and the telescope have been valuable in\ngathering the scientific knowledge of the universe. Now a new tool is needed by all those who\nwould try to understand and direct effectively their action in this world, whether they are\nresponsible for major decisions in politics, in science, and in industry or are ordinary people\nas we are.\nI shall call this instrument the macroscope (from macro, great, and skopein, to observe)\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credits: Cecilia Berlin, Ben Streek (Shortfilms NL), Gerben Kijne, MIP Politecnico di Milano Graduate School of Business Music Credits: http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Coming from a background of ship and product design, we’re use to large, complex projects. While this is our first design and delivery of a board game, we feel we’ve done our homework. The gameplay has been tested extensively and final production preparations will continue during the campaign. \n\nWe've set the target age for 13+ based on the insights gathered from testing with educators who teach 13-15 year old students. They overwhelmingly said 'my students would have no problems grasping this game.' \n\nWe’re in the process of selecting our game producer for the large run and we plan to have this locked in by the time the campaign ends. All are experienced professionals so we’re not anticipating major delays. We’ve also built in extra time into our schedule. (Of course, delays beyond our control are always possible.)\n\nFinally, following in the footsteps of other successful campaigns, we’ve researched shipping and have selected a method we plan to use.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nThe Contractors is an immersive, grand-scale role-playing game set in a war-torn future of super-soldiers, giant mechs, and vanishing humanity. Because of its size, we’re developing the game in stages. For this fund goal, we are focusing on: Finalized creation of 3D Model: Prop Asset Model #1 3D Model: Prop Asset Model #1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal concept art for for Prop Asset Model #1 What We Will Achieve In This Phase To tackle such a big project, we’re adopting an old strategy: “How do you take down a hydra? One head at a time.” We’re applying this approach to our funding, where we’ll be breaking up the games funding and development into discrete, deliverable milestones. For this stage of funding, we’ll be focusing on creating finalized game-ready character 3D model for this 3D Prop Asset Model. As you can see from the concept art above, it is a very complex model to build and we will be working with only the best 3d modelers to realize such detail. In addition, we’ll be creating a simple “whitebox” test environment, in which you’ll be able to play as some of our characters, with some of our weapons. Backers even at the lowest tier will receive this test environment as a playable executable file (.exe). Our Vision Think about the games you love and what you love most about them. Is it driving around a huge cityscape in a sweet ride of your choosing, whether it’s got four wheels or spinning blades, chasing glory while sunset eases in the night? Is it the adrenaline rush of raining gunfire as you tactically take out waves of enemy soldiers with a kick-ass arsenal of weapons you’ve level grinding to obtain? Is it mastering the skills and upgrades of your multi-class character as you send them through an epic, seamless, and reactive story? Well, we love all those things, too. That’s why we want to fuse together all the best parts of all our favorite games and make something awesome – and we want to bring you in on it. We understand that’s an ambitious goal. We’re an ambitious people. But we’re also being realistic about it. Building something like this is going to take time, a clear and flexible plan, and lots of hard work. So, we’re planning to get the engine running one phase at a time. We’re hoping you’ll join us while we realise our dream game. It’s still early days, but if you stick with us, your ideas can become a reality too. The Story In The Contractors, the world has advanced through unimaginable technological marvels in the game of war. So much so, that our drives of greed and ambition ran unencumbered by limitation and consumed the world like a wildfire. Now we are spared one thing: desperation. We’ve come full circle. It’s a dog-eat-dog world but instead of claws and fangs, we have guns loaded with more ammo than there are human lives left. The cities are hollow. Our armies draw strength from living steel. In some measures, machines are the dominant species of the world’s ravaged ecosystem, and the masters they answer to are ones who will never stop fighting. Because, after all, isn’t there always something to fight for? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Gameplay A lot of what we have planned for The Contractors is still being refined and tested, while other aspects are still being designed. What we can share for sure now is our design goals: Open-world exploration\n Seamless storyline with interwoven missions\n Gorgeously rendered environments\n Third- and first-person interchangeable POV\n Elegant, world-appropriate interfaces Want some more details? Here are some features we have planned: Powered mech-suits\n Drivable vehicles to explore with\n RPG-style experience leveling Real-time encounters of waves of enemies in the open world (no transitions here!) Gun fights with elements of cover-based combat\n Item loot drops and a robust inventory system Customisable weapon upgrades Why Crowdfunding Getting to this point in pre-production hasn’t been easy. As an indie developer, I personally have tapped into my own funds to create the initial concept art and models, as well as devote my time to work on building this game. To date, it’s been 3 years – and there’s been no inkling to slow down. To continue with building this game, we need some support. The funds which you, our beloved backers, generate will be used to fund the creation of high-end assets made by some very talented artists – and they don’t come cheap. That’s why we need you. Rewards and Perks One of the unique aspects of our crowdfunding efforts is including any potential backer into the development process. Have you ever wanted to design a weapon or vehicle, and then see it fully realised in a game? Well this is your chance! For a limited number of backers at certain reward tiers, we’re offering a chance to work together with our art team to design a custom exclusive skin for a weapon, vehicle, or character (whichever you choose) which will then be posted in our game store. We’ve made this opportunity exclusive to some of the higher-end reward tiers. Please see our reward perks for more details. Other Ways You Can Help Whether you can contribute as a backer or not, you can always help by sharing the game with people you know. So please don’t hesitate to spread the word if you want to see the game get made! Any of our promotional art or videos – anything at all – are free to be shared on social media, forums, or what-have-you. Thank you for your support! Risks and challenges One of the risks of breaking up development into milestones is that we may only reach partial success. If we succeed in reaching this goal, it’s no guarantee that the next goal will be fully funded. And since there will be multiple steps between now and getting the final game ready for wide release and shipped, we need backers to be aware that if a funding foal fails before then, we will not be able to get there.\n\nBut don’t give up hope! We believe in this project and will work very hard to reach as many of you as we can to get everyone as excited about The Contractors as we are.\n\nAlso, please do note that we are still in the very early stages of development. Ideas and design may change as production continues, so please be mindful of this. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story I have wanted to put on a non-traditional fashion show since before I can remember.  I'm capable of pulling it all together by myself, but I won't have to bother with all that work.  I have many many friends who are enthusiastic about this project and have already volunteered to help in any way.  I am a costume designer in the Theatre world, so my friends include but are not limited to Lighting Designers, Hair and Makeup experts, Set and scenic Designers, Sound Engineers, Stage Managers, Wardrobe Dressers,  DJ's, MC's, Dancers, and Models.  So my main job will be contacting, enlisting, and coordinating their help.  It is perfect timing to do something like this in my life and in my town.  This fashion show is not going to be your average fashion show with \"normal\" clothing.  Not only will the costumes be much larger than life, but I plan on making the actual event into more of a performance rather than simply showing off my costuming skills on girls who are simply walking down the catwalk.  I know the crowd exists in Duluth.  My collections include Steampunk Style, Burning Man-inspired costumes, Lisa Frank creations, Sasha Style (inspired by my normal rocker/DIY look), and creepy costumes inspired by Murder Pretty (a horror film company I'm involved in here in Duluth).  I have a lot of my own resources to pull from within the shop I run.  Any donations to the project I receive will be put into buying fabricand materials needed, paying for venue costs, creating a special reception for Kickstarter contributors and VIPS, and into printing things like programs, tickets, and VIP passes.  Every dollar will be utilized to the max. Thanks for your never ending love and support.  I'd be nowhere without it. Risks and challenges There are a couple of really important risks that I'm already tackling. One is cementing dates, venue, and help. I'm not as worried about recruiting volunteers as I've already had a huge response from those that would be happy to dedicate a few day to my project. And, as I said earlier, I could (in theory) do all the work myself. My worries come in when I start to think about using the space and coordinating the volunteer days. I am currently working that all out as we speak, but the plan is to have all the details in order a week before the Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nMy second worry is that the event will not be what I picture in my head. I have learned in my work as a Costume Designer that that will always be a struggle. I am however confident that the event will be a total success and a smash hit that I will be able to start doing annually. The fact that the beads on the reception tables are not exactly what I had hoped for seems like a pretty insignificant worry in the bigger scheme of things.

The film is set in 2020 in Sydney, Australia, a time when a curfew has been placed on women so that they can't walk the streets alone at night. Our protagonist, an influential media personality who is strongly against the curfew is attacked in her own home by a man who wants to limit her voice and power. The genre is a drama/thriller. We hope that our film makes a strong comment on the way that victim blaming is so prevalent in today's society, and it cannot be tolerated. We are in need of some extra money in order to get some quality equipment to film with, buy props, get make-up artists, feed the cast and crew and so on. Any donations would make so much difference! Risks and challenges When the film is completed, we will be entering it into a number of festivals, including Sydney Film Festival. We would obviously love for our film to be accepted into at least 1 film festival, but we know that when the film is completed, what films are and are not picked for festivals is out of our control, all we can do is hope for the best.

The extra size becomes imperceptible in use, and the featherweight promises long sessions of painless use... I had no trouble wearing the Pimax headset over my glasses... the image was clearly superior to today's top-end products\" WifiHifi  2017.10.19 \"As soon as I put on the headset, I was amazed by the lack of black border within my vision. For the first time ever, I finally felt like I wasn't looking into a VR headset!  As expected, I could not see any sub-pixels thanks to the insanely high display resolution, nor did I notice any ghosting.\" Engadget  2017.10.12 “...Booting up theBlu, a passive VR experience that plunges you into the depths of the ocean, I could really appreciate that added range on the 8K headset; visually it felt a lot more natural...I'd done this experience on the HTC Vive before, but here I felt even more like I was down there with the sea life, not looking at it through a pair of ski goggles. Not having that periphery blocked made a lot of difference, and going back to using the Vive afterwards definitely felt like a step back... it's the 8K that really raises the bar for VR.\" Wareable 2017.10.09 \"...This truly feels like a next-gen headset. I have to say the 200 degree's FOV is absolutely a game changer. It's really on a whole different level to anything I've used (Oculus/PSVR and even the Pimax BE) the sense of presence you feel with those extra degree's is amazing. I got to play Fruit Ninja and also Big Screen desktop. The clarity of the display was sharper than my samurai sword I was wielding in Fruit Ninja, and fluid as anything. I could not perceive SDE or god rays when using it. I am already used to having a high-resolution headset anyway (when compared to Rift/Vive) but take that, and add those extra degree's FOV and you get an idea of what it's like. In fact, someone likened it going from 4:3 to Widescreen Televisions - it's *that* dramatic.\" User hands-on review on Elite Dangerous forum 2017.10.06 \"The 200° FOV is something you won't be able to go back from, using my Oculus now feels like I'm viewing the world through a scuba mask!  The screen/lens combo is so far ahead of the current Oculus and Vive it's ridiculous. No screen door, little to no rays or ghosting... no chromatic aberration or \"ripples\" from a fresnel lens, no visible sub pixels, no noticeable smearing Despite looking bulky.  “The headset is light, lighter than the Vive apparently, and didn't slosh around as my head turned quickly.\" User hands-on review on Reddit  2017.10.05 “In addition I would say the colours felt very intense and had a kind of popout effect on me which was really cool also the brightful image was very apparent to me.” DaHillersen 2017.09.08 “...a very early but extremly impressive prototype using an advanced laser tracking system and 2 4k screens, one for each eye. Additionaly the system has 2 perfectly working all-orientation controllers for a wide range of applications. The system has by far the best resolution, movement tracking and Field of view of all systems I have tested ad the exhibiton. \" JL2579 2017.09.05 \"The 200 degree FOV does make an enormous difference. You no longer feel like you are wearing ski goggles. It feels like natural vision since your periphery is no longer blocked.\" \"8k resolution truly feels next-gen. There was zero screen door effect. Objects looked perfectly solid and you could see the details up close. There was no aliasing. Apart from the obvious graphical artwork of the world, there was nothing to indicate I was in a digital world. It felt like a real, solid world.\" \"Going back to Oculus Rift after trying the Pimax feels like wearing a last-gen headset. Like using the iPhone before its 'Retina' display.\" Movingfulcrum  2017.03.15 \"The headset’s resolution was probably the best thing about the headset. Whilst inside, I couldn’t discern individual sub-pixels no matter how hard I looked – whereas with the Rift or Vive I can. It took some effort to even discern individual pixels.\" Roadtovr  2017.01.14 \"...images moved with my head movements with less latency than one would expect with little to no bloom distortion (pixels that change color too slowly and cause a blurry image) at all.\" Upload VR  2017.01.10 \n\nThrough the lens:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPimax 8K is a cutting edge virtual reality device designed for VR futurists. Our goal is to create an intuitive VR without the shade of the headset, and sharp enough that you won't be disturbed by pixels.  We doubled FOV to 200 degrees, with an increased resolution to 2*3840x2160. Meanwhile, we have eliminated motion sickness, which is often associated with longer exposure to a virtual environment.  Pimax 8K VR has been built to support the mainstream content currently available in the market, including Steam VR, while offering the largest field-of-view (FOV) of 200° and the highest resolution (2*3840x2160) on any VR headset on the market with less than 15ms latency.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrivaled Visuals  Pimax was first to market with a 4K VR headset, and that was just the beginning. We've refined elements from our 4K model, including ghosting and brightness, and now we're the first to bring you VR in 8K, with these issues resolved. Say goodbye to screen door effect, as we’re the ones putting “reality” into virtual reality.  \nPimax 8K offers 200° Field of Vision (FOV), which is far closer to matching the natural human FOV of 220°. Users can simply use their peripheral vision instead of constantly moving their head, making for a more intuitive experience. \nIn addition, we’ve addressed and reduced one of the key visual shortcomings of VR technology. Known as the “screen door effect”, this is the phenomenon where the eye can detect the fine line between pixels in an image - something which, in VR can hinder immersion and the experience as a whole.  \nWith 8K VR (3840x2160 per eye) you can dive into a world of clarity, while the graininess and \"screen door\" will never disturb you again, thanks to our awesome 2*3840x2160 resolution.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n FOV Comparison \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSDE Comparison  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (original youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aHIsPSzmng) \nFor input signals that less than 8K, e.g. 4K, Pimax 8K can upscale 4K signals to 8K resolution with a special video processing module in the headset.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lighter option \nIt's always good to have options, so we are also offering a special 5K edition for Kickstarter. Pimax 5K has all of the same features as Pimax 8K, apart from a difference in resolution and, of course, price. The resolution of 5K (2*2560x1440) is less than 8K (2*3840x2160), but still places it above many of the current headsets on the market.  A 5K resolution is good enough to eliminate screen door, and ideal if you are not as deeply concerned about pixels.  \nBrainwarp \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrainwarp is a set of technologies Pimax use in the VR headsets.  \nFor example, 8K renders and displays image in a sequence. i.e. For each time, only one eye can see a 4K image. Pimax 8K renders a single 4K image at 150/180 times per second, but users perceive a complete 8K at 150/180 Hz with high frame rate. \nBrainwarp boosts refresh rate, reduces latency and decreases GPU pressure for a smoother VR experience. \nVR Content  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pimax 8K SDK integrates with Unity and Unreal Engine, and supports C++ API, and will help you discover the true potential of your existing content. Furthermore, we've opened the 8K device driver SDK and HDK for you to develop new accessories. The Pimax team is excited to support you with digital tutorials, an active forum, and Skype/email interactions.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping with Pimax 8K allows you to:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user scenarios of VR are still limited, let's work together to explore the edge of VR experience! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPimax was dreamed up in Shanghai and Silicon Valley. We are a group of developers that have decades of experience in smart devices, including many years experience in VR headset R&D and manufacturing. We are addicted gamers.  \nWe are motivated to create 4K headset to eliminate the screen-door effect. We created Pimax 8K to remove the binoculars, so that you can use peripheral vision to detect enemies in VR.  \n\n\n\nPimax 4K was recognized as the best VR product of CES Asia 2016 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to drive VR towards the direction of big FOV and high resolution. By launching on Kickstarter, the base camp of passionate and creative folks, we can shape Pimax 8K based on your feedback and deliver it to you faster.  \nNot only do we value the input of you early adopters, but for the developers amongst you - we want to make sure we are tailoring a headset to your specific needs in terms of enhancing the VR experiences you create.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR Aircraft project open for participants \nWe made HMDs that works in a flight machine. However, we do not have enough expertise in making aircrafts, thus we are offering the VR aircraft project to those who interested in making it happen. Please download our VR Aircraft Images  HERE .  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Risks and challenges Manufacturing is not an issue, as we have delivered over 30K Pimax 4K headsets globally in half a year. For our Pimax 8K, we will use the Fresnel lens (2nd generation) without any supply issue. \n\nWe are in the stages of finalizing the solution for positional tracking, and as such it may delay the shipping time of rewards that include positional tracking. To overcome this we have come up with multiple positional tracking options, and we are seeking support and partnerships. \n\nRefresh Rate - \n\nThe display panel supports 90Hz according to it's specification, and it has proven a stable 90Hz in another project. The display port is DP1.4 and the chip we used supports DP1.4 as well. So theoretically, Pimax 8K can support 90Hz.\n\nBut the stability is much important because our HMD should work out of the lab in thousands of computers condition. In the past two weeks, we have done more stress tests from 75Hz to 85Hz base on V3 hardware (latest DP 1.4 solution). Up to now, the 80Hz is confirmed stable. 82Hz just pass the initial test standard. And now we’re trying to optimize on 85Hz and 87Hz. Since 90Hz is the upper limit of the whole system. Several hardware reasons might make the refresh rate drop: the clock rate, cable length, display adapter FPC, EMI desense issue. Contact impedance from different Video Card’s DP connectors, etc.\n\nNative resolution and frame rate per eye base on latest DP V3 prototype:\n\n3840*2160*80Hz (no risk, passed sufficient stability test, guaranteed)\n3840*2160*85Hz (medium risk, not passed initial stability test, not guaranteed)\n3840*2160*90Hz (high risk, not pass initial stability test, not guaranteed)\n\nWe will keep updating the progress. In a worse scenario where the refresh rate falls between 80 - 85Hz in the final product, we believe we can still guarantee to deliver the best VR experience with dual 4K resolution panels 、200 degree FOV and lighthouse tracking system, plus some other methods, such as the ASW/ATW/Brainwarp.\n\nAs we all know, the below facts of MTP (motion to photo)\n\nMTP = sensor response time + GPU rendering time + 1/refresh rate + display switching time\nThe refresh rate is one fact of the MTP. Not all facts. There’re many other solutions could get good MTP performance.\n\nPimax 8K Module Status and Pimax Realizations Policy - \n\nAs you know, our 8K HMD is modular designed, so we ourselves will mainly focus on the HMD devices developments and provide interfaces to partners, as for the modules, we will mainly open to 3rd party vendors.\n\nWe will open HDK for modular design, hope more and more partners and DIY enthusiasts to join us to create various exciting modules!\n\nPlease check the latest status as follows:\n\nEye tracking \nWe have 3 partners, one of them have already produced commercial level eye tracking module for vive, the other one is Adhawk introduced by our backer. We are evaluating the technical solutions and the detailed schedule, our target is to ship the modules from Q2 2018. \nRisk level: low\n\nWireless \nOur partner has the experience on commercial wireless products, we are working with our partner in adaptation, the shipping time estimated to be Q3 2018.\nRisk level: medium\n\nHand motion module\nWe have finished the technical verifications and demo, currently working with our key partners on the detailed schedule. \nRisk level: low\n\nInside-out tracking \nWe have designed the interface, currently working with partners with the detailed schedule. \nRisk level: low\n\nScent enabling \nWe are working with Japanese partner to discuss the solution and development schedule\nRisk level: low\n\nVR frame/cooling fan \nEstimated to ship on Q2 2018.\nRisk level: no risk\n\nAll in one module\nWill be developed in-house.

    "textDescription": "Story  The ‘i do it 4 oakland’ mural project reflects a ground breaking restorative justice model for Oakland’s new graffiti ordinance. This project incorporates young Oakland taggers and invites them to create a contemporary art piece on a building that they had previously tagged.  This innovative approach to graffiti prevention offers young artists the chance to design and legitimately work on a community mural project. By asking them to participate in the process of creating a mural, we believe these taggers will be invested in protecting their work from future tagging.  \n\n\nThe tagged building May 2013 \n \n\n \n This unique and collaborative mural project brings together the volunteer group Keep Oakland Beautiful, District 5 Councilperson Noel Gallo, the art collective Rock Paper Scissors, young taggers and an affected property owner to transform a heavily tagged building into street art the entire community can enjoy.  In May 2013, a building chosen by Councilperson Noel Gallo’s office was adopted by Keep Oakland Beautiful, who painted the building every weekend in June, covering tags within 48 hours of their appearance. Word had gone out on the street that the ‘i do it 4 oakland ‘ project was not your usual mural project run by established muralists, but a pilot project inviting young taggers to transform their community, where they live, through art.   Remarkably, the building has remained largely graffiti free.  \n\n\nThe 'buffed' building November 2013 \n \n\n \n These young ‘Writers’, who already feel marginalized by institutions dictating what is appropriate behavior, express themselves by writing their street names where all can see. Funding this project will give, a selected group of established Graf artists, the opportunity to coach young taggers, to channel their painting skills into a visual expression that becomes a shared vision with the building owner, and neighborhood residents.  We believe everyone in the community will benefit from this partnership. The street graffiti artists are offered an outlet for their artistic talents, the property owner, who gets final approval of the design, enjoys an attractive building front, and the surrounding community a tag-free building.   Help us support urban youth and take graffiti abatement in a new direction. Your contribution will provide funding for the following supplies:\n\n               •Artist quality aerosol paint & caps •Exterior latex paint •Assorted brushes •Rollers, handles & trays •Buckets and cages •Drop cloths •Respirators & latex gloves •Scaffolding •Sealer •Food & drinks for artists •Rewards expenses \n•Stipends for the three lead mural artists and six young graffiti writers, because creating art is a job.  \n\n Risks and challenges The biggest challenge will be designing a mural that both the young street writers and the more conservative property owner can agree upon. The building chosen has a very understanding owner. The lead artists will also help to bridge the communication/design gap.\n\nRisks will be the weather, as we are get closer to the rainy season. Any delays will be addressed by the project manager Cynthia Elliott from Keep Oakland Beautiful All donors will be contacted via our Facebook pages and websites.

    "textDescription": "Story About this project Bullet Face: Scar Tissue is a 2 part story (the 4th & 5th books) and the last issue of the arc, in a series of mini-comics I started self publishing in 2013. It's the story of a robot who doesn't know he's a robot, his best friend and caretaker Riley, and their adventures running from and sometimes INTO trouble with an evil empire of genetically altered individuals. All the books work together to tell one on-going story but it's split up into self contained comics that each build on, and hopefully deepen the tale. I had never published my own work before, and honestly, didn't know if I had it in me to do it at first. I struggled with confidence and self-belief, but now have finished and self-published the first 3 mini-comics with the help of Kickstarter and all of YOU... Book 1:Cold Heart, Book 2: Daydream, Book 3: Runaway and am now working on penciling and inking the last 2 books in the first story arc. I launched this Kickstarter last month planning to print BOTH books at once and with a higher goal since printing them at once would be twice as expensive, but since it didn't make it, I thought I'd go back to printing a book at a time. It seems to work, and the price and goal are more affordable and hopefully reachable. This project is still a little different then the first 3, in that I'm still drawing 2 mini-comics at once... but I've plotted and laid out both books and have already begun penciling, so hopefully it succeeds despite asking a little more than I usually do. First book Bullet Face: Cold Heart \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Second book Bullet Face: Daydream \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Third book Bullet Face: Runaway \n\n\n\n\n\n\n How long is the mini comic? \nBoth the fourth and fifth books are 16 pages. Black & white interior (12 pages), with color front, back and inside covers. I'm drawing it large, but printing it at 6x6. The first, second and third project turned out really well and the books look great! I didn't see a history of many mini comics projects on Kickstarter so I wanted to try to represent what they can be, and how cool a series of them could turn out, and I'm extremely pleased with the results. \nFirst book interior pages \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Second book interior pages \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Third book interior pages \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n So this is part of a series? \nYes. Each part will continue the story but also be relatively self contained stand alone tales. All in all, there are 5 mini-comics written to make up the first story arc. \nI've done this before. I've been here before. I can deliver my product and I hope to be improving art and storytelling wise every time I turn one out. \nI'm really excited to be doing this again, and thank you to everyone for reading this, and thanks SO MUCH for helping out, in the past and NOW. Anything at all... $1, $5, even just spreading the word and shouting it out on facebook and twitter makes a difference! Share. Share. Share. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions about ANYTHING. \nI have lots of different reward options but if there something I don't have offered and you'd like to see it, please let me know in the comments. \nSpecial guest print by Ben Coombs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSpecial guest print by Barbara Wittmann \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThanks so much Babs & Ben. \n\n\n\nAnd don't forget, 4x6 Beanbodyart characters drawn by me offered as a reward... I'll also post each of them as time-lapse videos on my youtube channel. \nThanks so much to everyone who took time to read this and to all the supporters, Thanks again! \n Risks and challenges I've successfully done 3 of these now, but there ARE things I struggle with. Rewards and mailing everything out isn't always smooth and the stress of trying to get the project SEEN on Kickstarter and keeping up with the social media needed to make the goal (Facebook. Twitter. Tweeting. Retweeting. Trying to get OTHERS to Share it on Facebook, Tweet it out and pass it on to others to do the same) and then not making the goal and the fear of that is all very difficult and real.

Version Française sous l'anglais !! ABOUT THE DIRECTOR  \n\n\n\nOn the set of Stagnant Pool \n \n\n \nAfter premiering my collaborations (POLET, LE CYCLE) with creative agency TRUSST exclusively on DAZED DIGITAL in 2009, I have continued to explore the body, identity and sexuality in a series of personal experimental shorts. Stagnant Pool explores a series of new themes explained below.I have also gone on to creating commercial work for international brands such as ALDO, L'OREAL, SSENSE, DIESEL, BIOTERM & SID LEE.My work has been screened in various festivals including in Paris, Milan, London, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels, Toronto and Montreal. \n\n\nNico Archambault stars as Narcissus \n \n\n \nThe film's star, dancer and choreographer Nico Archambault was the first performer to win So You Think You Can Dance Canada and has gone on to dance for Janet Jackson amongst others, star in several feature length movies and produce his own television show on Radio Canada. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSPIRATION It was during my time in university, studying Communications, that I became interested in behavioral shifts resulting from new technologies. While writing a paper about the impact of social media on human interaction, I stumbled upon a book by Twenge and Campbell, where they cite statistics showing that diagnosis for Narcissistic Personality Disorder has tripled within the last decade. They associated this increase to the rise of social media whose interface/structure imposes a focus on ones self. -- C’est pendant mes études universitaires en Communications que j’ai commencé à m’intéresser aux changements de comportement des gens résultant des nouvelles technologies. En rédigeant un travail sur l’impact des médias sociaux sur les interactions humaines quotidiennes, je suis tombé sur un livre de Twenge et Campbell où l’on mentionnait que le Trouble de la personnalité narcissique avait triplé dans la dernière décennie. Les auteurs associaient cette augmentation à l’émergence des médias sociaux, dont la structure et l’interface sont très centrées sur l’image personnelle. \n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FILM/ LE FILM Reading up on the symptoms of NPD, it occurred to me that the myth of Narcissus would be interesting adapting into a dance film. Reinterpreting a familiar tale was a great exercise for exploring \nlinear storytelling through my signature aesthetic, something I had never done before.  Rather than purely making a film about dance in a location other than the stage, I wanted to take full advantage of the medium and have the dance come in at the climax of a storyline. The overall tone of the film will be very theatrical and moody. It takes an even more surreal turn after Narcissus falls under the spell of his own reflection. A lot of the choreography references the psychological profile of a \nperson with NPD. Certain elements of the original fable were modified to\n make parallels to today's current trends in social media.  -- Le fait de réinterpréter une histoire familière a été une opportunité pour moi d’explorer une forme narrative plus linéaire tout en conservant mon esthétique personnelle, chose que je n’avais jamais faite auparavant. Au lieu de simplement faire un film sur la danse dans un contexte autre que la scène, j’ai voulu prendre pleinement avantage du médium et insérer la danse au point culminant du scénario. L’ambiance du film sera très théâtrale et riche en émotions. L’histoire prend un tournant encore plus surréaliste lorsque Narcisse tombe sous le sort de son propre reflet. Une partie importante de la chorégraphie fait référence au profil psychologique d’une personne souffrant du TPN. De plus, certains éléments du mythe de Narcisse ont été modifiés afin de faire des parallèles avec les tendances actuelles dans les médias sociaux. \n\n\n\n\n\nLOCATION + ART DIRECTION// LIEU DE TOURNAGE + DIRECTION ARTISTIQUE  The film was shot in the alien landscapes of Quarry Island within the Mingan Archipelago near Havre St. Pierre in Quebec and features Archambault starring alongside four dancers and choreography by Street Parade. Costumes were designed by Montreal-based designer Duy and Travis Taddeo. -- Le film fût tourné dans le paysage étrange de l’Île de Quarry de l’archipel Mingan, près de Havre-Saint-Pierre. Il met en vedette Nico Archambault accompagné de quatre danseurs, chorégraphiés par Street Parade. Les costumes ont été confectionnés par les designers montréalais Duy et Travis Taddeo. BUDGET BREAKDOWN / BUDGET DÉTAILLÉ I was lucky to get a grant from the CALQ for 7000$.  An extra 6000$ were required to shoot the film on location. We estimate to complete the film with a final 7500$. Due to the harsh weather conditions on the last day of shooting, an important scene must be re-shot. Luckily, the shot can be recreated in studio. The money raised here will go towards the one day re-shoot, the completion of sound \ndesign and score and some special effects required in the script--J’ai eu la chance de recevoir une bourse de 7000$ du CALQ pour ce projet. Il a fallu 6000$ de plus pour aller tourner à l’Île de Quarry, et j’estime qu’il faudra 7500$ supplémentaires pour compléter le film. À cause de conditions météorologiques difficiles lors de la dernière journée de tournage, une scène importante n’a pu être tournée. L’argent amassé sera investi dans la complétion de cette dernière scène en studio, les touches finales sur la trame sonore et l’ajout de quelques effets spéciaux nécessaires. WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH 10 000$CE QUE NOUS FERIONS AVEC 10 000$ The low water temperature on location were deemed to dangerous to shoot in so we had to cut them out of the script. With more money we could schedule another day of reshoot at an indoor pool!--La basse temperature de l'eau amenait un trop grand risque d'hypotermie pour les scènes sous l'eau donc la scène a été cancellée. En amassant 10 000$, nous pourrions la filmer dans une piscine intérieure! RELEASE / SORTIE DU FILM It is our intention and goal to have it  premiere at Cannes.-- Notre intention est de sortir le film en première à Cannes. LENGHT/DURÉE We estimate the final cut to be around 12 minutes long.--La version finale du film durera approximativement 12 minutes. Risks and challenges The challenge for the film is to make the final scene work. We are confident our crew will accomplish the same lighting in studio. The theatrical nature of the film will allow for it to flow as it is part of a dreamlike sequence. Of all scenes, this one is the easiest to rewrite and adapt as we go. It is also the strongest part of the choreography. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story \nImpress everyone at the next party !\n Titanium, Copper, Brass, and Aluminum whiskey glasses. We are back at it! After many requests for a larger Titanium drinking glass (From my Shot Glass project) we have finally sourced the material for this one of a kind glass !  Imagine sharing your fine whiskey, bourbon, scotch or other top shelf spirit with your dear friends, and their eyes light up when they see your beautifully polished and heat anodized Titanium Whiskey Glass! I did some searching for metal drinking vessels again. Like before, there are some real nice glasses, ceramic and even crystal out there. Though most are a copy of the classic design . So if you want something done right…I'm going to have to do it myself,  and do it like no one else. Each one of these are machined from SOLID bar stock . They are NOT cast, formed, stamped or punched out.  They are billet, solid, and heavy. We have included a picture of the shot glasses we did along side the Whiskey glass for size reference only .  Each Whiskey Glass holds 8 oz. - 7075 Aluminum \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany products out there made from aluminum are made from 6061. So called “aircraft aluminum”. Ready for a little history lesson? Raw aluminum in its natural state is almost useless. It’s about one step above clay. During WWll they started adding alloys to the aluminum to give it some strength. Light weight and strong, just what a B-17 needs. Hence the name aircraft aluminum. Now fast forward 70 years. Not much isn’t lighter and stronger. Big changes have happened to our metals. 6061 is now the industry standard for machined parts. Today’s aircraft, 7075 and 2024. Both the same weight as 6061, but almost twice as strong. So when someone throws out the catch phrase “6061 aircraft” and thinks it’s cool, yes it was, to your grandfather. \n\nThe aluminum glasses here are made from 7075. Yes it more expensive, but it’s also stronger. This means it’s more resistant to dents and dings.   Bare aluminum polished finish will have no effect on the taste of your beverage. Frying pans, cookie sheets and a lot of other cooking items are bare aluminum . It won’t hurt you, you have been eating off it for years and are here reading this. - 340 Lead Free Brass \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solid Brass, these glasses are made for 340 lead free brass. The rich luster of this material and shear weight lets you know, you have something special in your hand. Put this glass in the freezer along with you favorite spirits and this will be one cold drink. Brass will tarnish with time, but a little polish, some love, and the finish will be one you can be proud of. - Copper \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discovery of copper dates from prehistoric times . There are reports of copper beads dating back to 9000 BC found in Iraq. Methods for refining copper from its ores were discovered around 5000BC and a 1000 or so years later it was being used in pottery in North Africa. Copper has over four times the thermal conductivity of its closest rival, stainless steel. Copper is the worldwide industrial standard for distilleries, breweries and candy manufactures. Tried and true for thousands of years. Only 99.7%+ pure copper is used. Freeze this glass and you will not have ice diluting you beverage until its down the hatch.   Copper will tarnish with time also, but a little polish, some love, and the luster will glow for centuries to come.  These are very unique and first ever made. The material is more expensive than the brass or stainless, but when you consider that fine spirits have been made using copper setups for centuries..... You can't help but want the best for your spirit. - 6AL-4V Titanium (Grade 5 - The Good Stuff) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitanium, This alloy is half the weight of steel yet is twice as strong. Titanium comes in 2 basic groups. Grade 2 or \"CP\" is commercially pure, it can be formed, cut, welded, shaped with more difficulty then steels but it can be done. The Titanium I'm using is 6AL-4V which is a Titanium Alloy. This has been the corner stone of everything high performance over the past 50 years. There are a few variations of this alloy for more specific needs but most all are met with 4V. This glass will be handed down for generations to come. It won’t rust, corrode,  distort or change shape up to 2500 degrees F. The machine finish is smooth to the touch, yet rugged looking.  It is for the most demanding of customers. You know who you are. Nowhere else in the world will you find a Billet Titanium Whiskey glass! - Heat Anodized Titanium (EPIC Reward) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When you want your whiskey glass to be as beautiful as it is functional. This is true art . These painstakingly hand polished, and torched.   Many, many hours will go into these. A true labor of love, and it shows. Each Titanium glasses will  have a unique flame anodized pattern .  This finish will last a life time.  Each will be engraved with a serial number and on the bottom. This is the best of the best! - Polish\n I have Special Made Polish for Aluminum, Brass, and Copper available as an add-on to your current pledge. $7 each - a little goes along way! \n\n\nClick to watch the polish in action \n \n\n \n\n\n \n- Thank you for checking out my project, Rick Risks and challenges The brass, copper and aluminum cut very easy. The major problem is the Titanium. Tooling for Ti is very expensive, let alone the cost of this exotic material. It took almost 5 hours to cut the prototype Titanium Whiskey glass. Proper tooling is desperately needed. The drill alone is $610.00, the carbide tip is $117.00 each, and they wear out! Special boring bars and turning tools fall in the same price range. Our goal is set so we can get the tooling needed for Ti Whiskey Glasses. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Hey what's going on here? I'm raising money to shoot my second feature film, entitled WHAT CHILDREN DO . It's a script that I've been writing for the past two years and that we're going to shoot over the course of 14 days in upstate New York in April 2016.  What is the film about? WHAT CHILDREN DO is a comedy about Amy and Shannon, two sisters that haven't spoken in three years who are brought back into each other's lives by the impending death of their grandmother. \nThe older sister Amy, is a failed actress in LA, penniless and alone, pulling 25 hours a week at a frozen yogurt shop to make ends meet. Her younger sister Shannon lives a quiet and safe life as a librarian in a small town where she co-habitates with her boyfriend Pat, a lovable goof who's on a self directed karate regime. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth sisters return to their small hometown in upstate New York when they find out that their grandmother \"Nana\" is on the brink of death. The sisters must attempt to put aside their differences and take care of Nana in her final days. While back at home they encounter old flames, over zealous pastors, and overdue DVDs while attempting to repair their comically disastrous relationship and come to terms with the town they grew up in. \n\n\n\nSome of the influences for WHAT CHILDREN DO \n \n\n \n\n\nWho's making this thing? \nMeet our lovely team! \nDean Peterson  (Writer/Director) is a filmmaker from Brooklyn, NY. With the help of Kickstarter, he made his debut feature film INCREDIBLY SMALL which premiered at the Raindance Film Festival in London, and went on to play at over 30 festivals across the country. He put it online for free (watch it here! ) and it's been viewed over 64,000 times. He's also made the short films VING RHAMES , SEA BEACH LOCAL , STOP TELLING WOMEN TO SMILE ,and KILLING BALDACCI . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ariana Janetakis  (Producer) has produced television shows for VH1, Ovation, and TLC.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Zwiebel (Producer) is a Los Angeles based producer that works on films and commercials and is one of the founding producers of the Woodstock Comedy Festival. She without hesitation named her dog Joris Joplin. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarin Quan  (Director of Photography) shot the forthcoming feature film DIVERGE. He is currently producing/directing/shooting a show for Vox Media.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the production \nOur small, nimble and talented crew will be shooting the film in the lovely Catskill mountains in upstate New York. Everyone is going to stay in the house that we're shooting the movie in. It'll be just like summer camp, minus the nature hikes!  \n\n\n\nThe actual couch Dean will sleep on during shooting \n \n\n \n\n\nWe've already started location scouting and we're so excited to shoot in the gorgeous environs of upstate New York. \n\n\n\nKingston, NY \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hudson Valley \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWow, look at this waterfall. \n \n\n \n\n\nWe've also struck up some really cool partnerships with companies that are going to help us with things like color correction, sound mixing and final delivery. With your help we can pay them to help make the movie look and sound as good as possible and get it out into the world! \nThis sounds great, how can I help?? \nClick that little green button in the top right and make a pledge ! Check out the rewards on the right and chip in whatever you can. Truly any amount helps but the more the merrier! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also help by spreading the word! \n\nPost a link to the Kickstarer on TWITTER and FACEBOOK \n \nFollow us on INSTAGRAM @whatchildrendo \n \nCheck out our TUMBLR whatchildrendo.tumblr.com \n \nFollow us on TWITTER @whatchildrendo \n \n \n\nHow does crowdfunding work? \nWe've got 31 days to raise $15,000. Kickstarter is all or nothing so if we don't meet our goal by the end of the campaign, we get nothing! If we get even $14,999 we won't receive a single penny and my wife will be subjected to listening to me weep in the shower every day. \nWe're so excited about this film and the opportunity to have all of you involved in it's creation from the ground up. Kickstarter is an amazing tool that allows us to bring our audience into the process from day one, to enable you guys to not only witness but participate in the creation of our film! \nWhat kind of rewards are we talking about here? \nAside from the warm and fuzzy feeling you'll get from helping us make an awesome film, we've got some great rewards for Kickstarter backers like access to the film's exclusive Snapchat account, videos of the writer/director Dean Peterson embarrassing himself by doing the karaoke song of your choice, custom, one of a kind artwork, invites to parties and more! Check out all the great rewards in the sidebar to the right. \n\n\n\nMy fairly decent watercolor skills, one of these could be yours. \n \n\n \n\n\nThanks for checking out our Kickstarter! \n\n \n Risks and challenges Like all Kickstarter campaigns, this is all or nothing. We need to meet our goal of $15,000 or we don't get anything and the movie can't happen.\n\nIn addition to raising money, producing low budget feature films like this are one of the hardest but most rewarding experiences you could imagine. Working long hours for little money and forcing yourself to create miracles on a daily basis, not to mention our brisk 14 day shooting schedule will all add up to a lot of work. \n\nBut we've all been working on this film for months now and couldn't be more dedicated to the project. We're so excited to bring this unique movie into the world and with your help we know we can. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textLength": 3498,
    "textDescription": "Story We are in the midst of finishing the recording of our 2nd album, due to be rounded off by end of July. The new album is the follow up to our 1st, self released 2013 debut record 'Calypso' Since then we have released 2 singles (Imposter and September Storm) through Label Fandango/Fierce Panda, both of which are on the new record. The new record's sound has moved on since Calypso and sounds bigger, more cinematic, with a greater listener crossover. The 2 singles already released give a great flavour for the rest of the record. THE GOAL: We will be releasing the new album in October/November 2015 digitally but what we would love, and has always been our dream, is to have our record released on vinyl. Having physical releases means we can also have stock to take on the road and sell at shows. THE STORY: Since our last album release we've had radio airtime across BBC Radio 2, 6 Music, XFM Xposure, BBC Introducing, stations Holland, Montreal, New York and even 4 tracks from Calypso playlisted on LA's Playboy Radio! THE MUSIC: September Storm - (Latest single April 2015) \n\n\n\n\n\nImposter \n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to hear and buy our music to date:Soundcloud // Spotify // Itunes Follow us here: Facebook // Twitter // Instagram // Youtube THE PRESS: We've had brand associations with Carling, O2, Nivea and Sony Mobile for our music. We have toured the UK in support of our follow up singles including live supports with acts including Plan B and a recent sell out headline show at The Lexington in London for the Imposter single launch. London In Stereo (Live Review, LONDON – Lexington March 14th)\n“the Traps are set to capture more followers into their world of happily dark music.” http://www.londoninstereo.com/the-traps-live-review/ Sound Of Confusion (Live Review, LONDON – Lexington March 14th)\n“If you’re looking for an enjoyable, uplifting performance from a really intriguing act who have a hell of a lot to offer, get yourself down to one of The Traps shows. No doubt you’ll be smiling like loons and jiggling away all over the place throughout the entirety of the set, just like we were.” http://thesoundofconfusionblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/the-traps-live-at-lexington-london-14th.html THE MONEY: The £2000, will be simply split between the costs of the vinyl manufacturing. That covers quantities for backers whilst giving us some leftover to take on the road. The vinyl costs are £1500, t-shirt 2 colour print for backers - £300 and CD copies of our debut album Calypso - £200. Those of you who know our band and follow us already will know how hard we work for our music and every part that goes with it. We don't have a lot of money, we make our own music videos, we work hard making connections to do our own online global pr and radio plugging. I hope you’ll find a level that works with your budget or you find something that you really want. We are so excited by this record and can't wait for everyone to hear it. Thank you Nick, Jamie, Jim and Dan Risks and challenges As mentioned above we have funded the recording of this record completely ourselves. \n\nIt's taken 2 years of saving for studio and producer costs and mixing and has taken every penny we have spare to make it.\n\nThe risks of not completing our project mean it will just be an album that is released digitally to the world.\n\nWe know this record will sound great on your turntable!

    "textDescription": "Story (VIDEO SLIGHTLY NSFW) “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.  Since its debut in 1975, it has become the very definition of \"cult movie.\"  However, if you’ve ever been to a live performance of Rocky Horror, you know that the film is only one part of a very unique midnight movie experience.  \"Rocky Horror Saved My Life\" is not a documentary about the people who made this legendary movie, though.  It's about the fans who have devoted their lives to preserving it. For almost 40 years, people from all walks of life have \"given themselves over to absolute pleasure\" by performing live on the stages, aisles, and seats of cinemas showing \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\"  From the first time Louis Farese yelled ‘Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch!’ in the audience at the Waverly in NYC, to the innovations that have brought Rocky Horror “audience participation” into the 21st Century, we'll examine the origins and traditions of this truly unique cinematic phenomenon from the perspective of the people who sacrificed so much to keep it alive.  Throughout 2014, our crew will travel to cities all over the US, and possibly all over the world, to document the history of Rocky Horror’s avid collectors, live performers, and devoted fans. Given our experience, and the resources at our disposal, we feel quite confident that we can make one hell of a documentary, even on a fairly tight budget. Expenses for camera equipment, travel, and post-production can add up pretty fast though, so we can’t do this all on our own. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!  \n$50,000 is just a part of our entire production budget, but the funds generated from this Kickstarter campaign will enable us to make this dream a reality. \n\n$50,000 -  Equipment purchases/rentals: cameras, lights, audio gear, and media.  Crew:  both local and on location (when needed) .  Flights, hotels, crew meals, & Reward Fulfillment. \nSTRECH GOALS \n$75,000:  \nADDITIONAL REWARD UNLOCKED! - MP3 Digital Downloads of \"You Can Be Who You Wanna Be\" by Ryan Wilson for all Reward Levels! \nADDITIONAL PRODUCTION GOALS - Additional cast interviews and additional cities added to our production schedule.  Additional Crew: We can do a lot of this ourselves, but the more professional crew memberas we can hire, the better the final documentary will be.\nTransportation: More casts interviews means more travel expenses. \n$100,000:  \nADDITIONAL REWARD UNLOCKED! - Signed Postcards from the \"Rocky Horror Saved My Life\" crew for all Reward Levels! \nADDITIONAL PRODUCTION GOALS - Even more cast interviews and cities added to our production schedule, and possibly even a few celebrity interviews as well.  Overall Production Upgrade: As the budget expands, our crew will be more complete, equipment will be upgraded, and we will be that much closer to having everything that is needed for a great production.  \n\n \n$150,000:   \nADDITIONAL REWARD UNLOCKED! - HD Digital Download of the \"Rocky Horror Saved My Life\" documentary (upon completion) for all Reward Levels $10 & Above! \nADDITIONAL PRODUCTION GOALS - At this point, we'll even be able to interview casts and live performers in the UK!  Funds will be available for graphics, photo clearances, film festival fees, UK travel, and better post-production facilities. \n\n$200,000:  \nADDITIONAL REWARD UNLOCKED! - HD Digital Download of the \"Rocky Horror Saved My Life\" documentary (upon completion) for all Reward Levels $5 & Above!  \n \nADDITIONAL PRODUCTION GOALS - European production schedule unlocked!  Funds will also be available for video clearances, music rights, European travel, and movie-quality equipment purchases. \n\n$250,000:  \nADDITIONAL REWARD UNLOCKED! - DVDs of the \"Rocky Horror Saved My Life\" documentary (upon completion) for all Reward Levels $15 & Above!  \nADDITIONAL PRODUCTION GOALS - This level of funding would give us just about everything we need to make this documentary the way it deserves to be made. \nREWARDS \nNo matter how much you contribute, you get your money's worth!

Like Rocky Horror, we can’t do this without a whole lot of Audience Partici... pation! \n\nWe want to hear your story. Write to us at rockyhorrordoc@gmail.com , and tell us how Rocky Horror has helped to shape your life, define your identity, or save you from the tedious conformity of mainstream culture, even if it was just for one night. Your contribution will help us not only bring these stories to light, but also preserve them for the next generation of Rocky Horror fans. \nYou can also help by showing this project to anyone that ever borrowed their mother’s stockings and snuck out of the house to see the greatest midnight movie of all time. Please Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and any other social media network that may have popped up since this video began. \nFollow Us too for updates! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...and be sure to follow our progress here on Kickstarter for updates on the campaign, where we’ll be shooting next, and when you can see “Rocky Horror Saved My Life” in a theater near you. \nThank you very much for your time, and your support. \n \n Risks and challenges A live screening of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" can be a wild, raucous, and exhilarating rite of passage, but it's not exactly the easiest place to make a documentary. With heavy camera gear on their backs, our crew will work through showers of rice, toast, and toilet paper to capture the transcendent moments when a Rocky Horror performer truly brings their character to life, even with an entire audience shouting obscenities at them.\n\nLike any film, the production of \"Rocky Horror Saved My Life\" will not be cheap. The usual expenses of equipment, travel, and post-production will certainly apply. However, after years of being immersed in the Rocky Horror Community, our crew has a network of fans that stretches from coast to coast, and a DIY work ethic unlike any other. Many of our crew also have years of experience in film, television, and theater. We've all been eagerly waiting years for the chance to use the skills we've gained to honor the movie, and the people, that we love so much.\n\nPerhaps our greatest challenges will be in obtaining the rights to some of the wonderful music that Rocky Horror has given us. We plan to devote a good deal of our funding to the music for this project, as it is one of the main reasons that Rocky Horror has developed a following that spans generations. We also hope to introduce our audience to some less familiar Rocky Horror recordings, and celebrate the 40 years of creativity that this film and community have inspired. Please help us bring these unsung artistic heroes of Rocky Horror out from the shadows, and into the spotlight. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

He is a headstrong\neighteen-year-old who desperately wants to make a change in the city and on the streets.  Both he and his\nsister are orphans. \n\nTink (Amanda\nBerkowitz): Pan’s younger sister. She is a very shy, small, and quirky thirteen-year-old, but she is athletic and gymnastic when fighting.  \n\nMichael (Michael\nSkeen): A foster child who met Pan and Tink on the streets.  He originally suggested the idea of fighting for justice, but has since seen the futility of\nit.  He comes from a broken home and has\nfaced abuse. \n\nCasper (Parker\nThompson): A sixteen-year-old former drug dealer, with knowledge of multiple languages and the most technology-savvy\nof the group. \n\nAngel (Dana\nStory): A sixteen-year-old femme fatale. \nShe is manipulative, but a very good negotiator and fighter.  She smokes like a chimney.  She has a soft spot for Casper which usually goes ignored.  \n\nFelix (Kaio DeSouza):\nMichael’s foster brother. After fleeing the abuse at home, he found work in a local gang employed as mercenaries by the Loan Shark to hunt down debts and stop any opposition. Over the years he has climbed to the top and is now the leader of this gang.  \n\nLoan Shark (Jose\nRuiz): The owner of a local loan shark agency. \nHe often employs illegal methods to maintain control.  The HoodRatz’s goal is to take him down. \n\nTHE PROJECT: HoodRatz is a short indie film. The cast is mostly from Providence High School in South Charlotte.  The crew is composed of North Carolina School of the Arts students, Providence High students, and other young adults from the Charlotte area.   The project is being organized by Sasha Freger and Tanner\nAgle.  Sasha is studying film at Emory\nUniversity and aspires to be a screenwriter, director, and producer. Tanner is\nstudying film at North Carolina School of the Arts with a concentration in\ndirecting, producing, and screenwriting. \nBoth have worked on many smaller film projects before, but this will be\ntheir largest one to date.  They are\nterrifically excited to work on this film and hope there will be many more to\ncome. \n\nHoodRatz is expected to run thirty to forty minutes and will be\nscreened at the Duke Energy Theater in Charlotte, North Carolina summer 2013. \n\nThank you for your contribution.

    "textDescription": "Story Do you run role-playing games? If you're a Game Chief (or game master, or dungeon master), you probably already have some sort of screen that lets you keep secrets from your players. You probably have several. You do not, however, have anything like this.\n\n  These Game Chief screens are designed for half-sheets of 8.5x11\" or A4 paper, or A5 paper straight out of the box¹ . You can take whatever information you need, print it or hand-write it, then prop it up in front of you. You can also pick up a screen and hand it to a player at the table, as if to say \"here is the contract you've acquired.\" Or you can flip it around and use it as a dry-erase tablet.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe screens are made of sturdy ABS plastic. If you're determined to break one, you can, but the player who clumsily (or angrily) knocks one off the table is going to be very relieved (or disappointed) when the screen bounces and clatters and takes zero falling damage.  Each screen can hold up to six sheets of 8.5x11 paper folded in half. The upper left corner has a pin dock suitable for a hypernet node pin (yellow map pin), and the reverse side of the screen functions as a dry-erase board. The screen it can be mounted with either the dry-erase or drop-in side facing you, and it can be lifted from its \"foot\" and reversed with one hand.  With the feet removed, a set of three screens packs flat for easy transportation and storage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were designed to stand at an easy-to read angle, while still serving their primary function as a privacy screen that hides your die rolls from players. They're also balanced so they won't tip over—not forward, not backward, nor to either side—even when fully loaded. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdroit Engineering did amazing work on this design² . They solved problems we didn't know existed, and thought up things that would never have occurred to us. When Howard held the final product in his hands he cried, just a little, overcome by the experience of holding something that was so much better than what he had originally imagined. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize Might Matter (a Planet Mercenary Adventure) During this Kickstarter we are offering a $10 add-on:  a pre-built Planet Mercenary adventure, in PDF format, along with blank template sheets for NPCs and other encounter-type things. Those templates will be sized perfectly for dropping into your screens, obviously. The adventure, \"Size Might Matter,\" will debut at GenCon Indy in August of 2017. It takes the player characters to Eina Afa where they must search the enormous interior wilderness for a fugitive. Encounters with megafauna are a certainty.  This PDF will be pretty simply laid out, but it will get better if we meet the stretch goals that give us a budget for artwork, fancy layout, and colors. It will ship separately from the Game Screens. The basic text version (which might be the only version) will ship in August 2017. If we hit our stretch goals, we'll send updated versions of the PDF later, as they come ready. If you want to add the Size Might Matter PDF to another pledge, just increase your pledge by $10. If you missed the Planet Mercenary kickstarter and would like to add a Planet Mercenary book to your order, just increase your pledge amount by $20 for a PDF version or $55 for print + shipping. ($70 for international). A Bit of Backstory During the Planet Mercenary Kickstarter, back in 2015, Howard had this zany idea for a Game Chief screen that looked like the display screens and handbrains that appear in that setting. His daughter built a few mockups using cardboard, and everybody wisely decided that although the idea was cool, it was in a completely foreign realm from making books. We had no idea what kind of a budget would be required to build them. So we built a budget to find out what the budget was. We promised our backers that we would spend some of our profits on R&D for \"cool stuff we couldn't afford otherwise.\"  Those R&D funds covered all of the research, design, and tooling for the Game Chief Screens. Thanks to Adroit Engineering, we have a small run of the actual, final product in our hands. This Kickstarter will allow us to make more, and offer them to you.  What Are We Funding? Our funding goal is relatively low. It covers the minimum manufacturing run from our molding company. The funding goal also covers Kickstarter overhead, shipping, and the relevant taxes (ours, because we pay lots of taxes.) Obviously, if there's huge demand, the manufacturer can mold as many of the screens as we need. Stretch Goals The screens are fully designed. They're DONE. We're not doing anything fancy to them as stretch goals. Even if the project over-funds in enormous ways, the core product will be finished within a few weeks.  We do have some stretch goals: $30,000 - Ubiquitous Pins, and B/W Art:   Every screen will come with a pin (sets of three will come with three pins), and we will commission black & white art for the adventure PDF. We'll create additional maps and stats that are formatted into half sheets so they fit in your screen. (Note: The text-only PDF will still arrive in August. The art update will arrive in September.) $45,000 - Clear Plastic, and Adventure-in-Print: Every screen will also include a drop-in sheet of clear plastic, suitable for dry erase overlays. We'll also offer  a print version of the adventure as an add-on. The cover will be in color, and the interior (with all the art and stuff from the 30k stretch) will be in black and white. (Note: The printed adventure won't arrive until October.The text-only PDF will still arrive in August, and the art-and-layout PDF will still arrive in September.) $60,000 - So Colorful!  The print version of the adventure will be full color, inside and out. (Note: Same dates as above—Text-only in August, art update in September, print version in October) These stretch goals will not delay the delivery date of the screens. The pins and plastic are now sourced, and can be obtained and packed as part of the original schedule. FOOTNOTES ¹ A4 paper, when folded in half, is a teency bit taller than 8.5\"x11\", but still fits behind the borders of the screen. Width-wise it's a tighter fit, but Adroit Engineering made sure that it was an actual fit. Put another way, the screens are 100% compatible with the A4, A5, and Letter paper sizes.  ²   The screens are 100% American designed and manufactured. We like being able to do that.   Risks and challenges The screens are completely designed, tooled, and ready to be molded. The only real risk with the manufacturing is whether our manufacturer suffers some unforeseen issue outside the scope of what we're asking them to build. You know, stuff like floods, or tornadoes, or plagues of locusts. Wandering monsters. Long, statistically unlikely series of crit-fails on \"pull lever\" skill checks.\n\nWe know how to ship thousands of packages to thousands of people, so fulfillment isn't likely to be a problem. We've done this a dozen times before. Sure, we're just as likely to suffer from the random encounter table as anybody else is, but we're taking care to roll as few dice as possible.

Crosstownʼs origins come from various articles dealing with true events centered around the forcible recruitment of undocumented immigrants by the US Military, enticed to fight for their new country with the promise of naturalization papers for themselves and their families. In the period which the film is set – at the end of Bush’s Presidency leading into the Obama era – there were an estimated 20,500 \"non-U.S. citizens\" dubbed \"green-card warriors\" serving in the military, of which a significant numberof “illegals” died in Iraq, and in many cases, the green card never came.. Crosstown stars Manny Perez (La Soga, Bella), Vivica. A. Fox (Curb YourEnthusiasm, Kill Bill, Independence Day), Adrian Bellani (Moneyball, RPMMiami), and introduces a phenomenal young talent, Angel Amaral. \n\n\n\nYoung love with Angel Amaral & Paige Hurd playing Angel & Jazmine. \n \n\n \n\nCrosstown is a labor of love that many people have generously given theirtime, energy and talents for free to ensure this film was made and will havethe chance to be shared with film audiences. Writer/Director MiriamKruishoop and Producer Bronwyn Cornelius led a predominantly female teaminto Los Angeles’ Downtown, South Central and Pico Union neighborhoodsproducing the film for a very low budget, and it is extraordinary what theteam has been able to accomplish for so little. Every dollar has beenmaximized and stretched as far as it possibly can, and we are incrediblygrateful for everything that so many have dedicated to the film. Now weneed your generous help and a little more cash to get this film to the finish line. Funds\nraised from this campaign will cover the following:  \n\nPost Production & Festival Cut Finishing Costs (audio, visual,\ncredits) Festival Publicist & Publicity Materials (posters, postcards,\nElectronic Press Kit) Festival & Film Marketing \n(website design, web building, social media & outreach) With the film being so close to completion and ready for\nfestivals, rather than being in the development or pre-production stage, this\nis a great opportunity to be part of a film that will soon be seen by\naudiences, and to know you are an invaluable part of that dream, reality and\ngoal. \n\nIf you feel this story is important, care about equal rights and believe everyone should get the same opportunities in life, then the message in Crosstown is one that deserves your support. Please help us reach our goal and share this important story with the world. Please see our pledge list in the column on the side.  \n\n\nCrosstown team takes a break from filming to represent outside LA street aritst, Retna's, Pico Blvd. murial \n \n\n \n\n\n\nCT in IndieWire \n \n\n \n\n PRESS & INFO Check out the links below to read articles that inspired the film, more film stills and behind the scenes images etc. Every donation counts and we will make every dollar work!  Get behind the scenes on our Flickr page. FACEBOOK  stay connected Democracy Now! on latino recruitment LiveLeak about US army recruitment Risks and challenges There are always risks associated with funding a project. We understand this and want to put in place checks and balances to ensure the generous donations we receive for our campaign are used efficiently and effectively. \n\nFor our post production funding goals we have pre-negotiated rates with our finishing partners and they have completed parts of the scope of work for deferred fees. There is a risk that our final product could be delayed because of other work that these partners will be doing while they fit us into that schedule. We feel that we have given ourselves enough lead time on this aspect and should there be some delays it won't materially affect our final delivery target.\n\nFor the remaining areas we want to use our Kickstarter funds for we are subject to availability of the people we wish to work with as they are performing their jobs at a much reduced rate because of their passion for the film. So while they are 100% committed to us ultimately there are realities of the working world we have to factor into the timeline. While most of our team is based in Los Angeles we are working we a diverse group of people from other parts of the country and also from Europe. Keeping the work flow on track can be challenging with those parameters and again it is an issue we are aware of and aim to stay one step ahead.

    "textDescription": "Story The purpose of this project is to get the funding required to be able to frame, ship and advertise my work for my first ever solo at the lovely Arts in Oxford gallery in the South Island of New Zealand (which is a charity trust gallery https://artsinoxfordgallery.wordpress.com/ ) from June 10th to July 1st, 2015. It is an exhibition which will help me get to the next level of my art career as it is my first exhibition (of only my work) in a recognised gallery. I would like to give every (worldwide) contributor the equivalent of their monetary contributions back to them in art. In the past year I created many series (over 300 works) in a sort of celebration of the untamed landscape, depicting patterns such as the lines and drips Essence of a landscape series which I will show: http://michelinerobinson.co.uk/575547/drips-and-lines-essence-of-a-landscape-s-2014/ as well as this one: http://michelinerobinson.co.uk/626810/2015-click-on-images-to-see-series/ \n\n\nIn the thick of it, inks on canvas \n \n\n \n\n\nEntranced with a new painting medium (inks), I have produced 4 series (one of them emotional and slightly different) which are an outpouring of all that I have been absorbing visually (especially from my new Kapiti Coast home and my jungle forest walks)– patterns of nature, lushness of landscape...seeking to crystalize the concept of a landscape without losing its essence. Instead of painting a tree I let the inks drip to recognisable shapes, the paint brush rarely being present. The intuitive brain takes over and am now discovering things myself in nature that I recognise from my paintings. Patterns that were created that were from real sources unbeknownst to my thinking brain. \n\n\nEvery day chaos and permanent balance, inks \n \n\n \n\n\nDuring a camping holiday on the South Island, we stopped by a lovely gallery in Oxford and was enchanted with the space and works that were on show. I had a fantastic chat with one of its members, an artist who created works from pigments she combined herself; from mixing honey will local earth and minerals she found around the region. A month later, I was invited to submit a proposal which was consequently, to my absolute pleasure, accepted. \n\n\nFlaques, inks \n \n\n \n\n\nI have continued with the series and the work is getting stronger, larger and better. I am quite excited by the developments and by the prospects of being able to show them shortly. However, although I am building up an audience in NZ and I have started to get collectors, even with the sales I have made, it is unfortunately not enough to cover the costs of framing the works and shipping them to the South Island. \n \n\n\nItalian garden or summer breeze? Inks on large aluminium \n \n\n \n\n\nAs I will need the help of kickstarter to help with the funding of this project, I would like to make it worthwhile for you, my investors and am keen to give you in art the equivalent of what you will give in monetary contributions. \n \n\n\ndetail of one of the recent paintings on aluminium \n \n\n \n\n\nI will update every development with pictures and stories and hope to involve you in the process of this project as much as I can.

Delivery of the artwork is a big task, and I've already got three options, so hoping that one of them works out. Might have to use all three, given the different sized pieces of art and the sheer volume of work being framed and shipped for this show.\nI guess when I travel to the show, either by Interislander Ferry or a cheap flight from Wellington, there may have a few hiccups, but we know we can there somehow. :) Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World of Aden is struggling for survival against a foe that seems invincible. Not so long ago, the world was in the throes of an industrial revolution, with the discovering of gunpowder and steam power giving rise to the incredible power of mechamagic, the union of magic and technology. Each passing year brought incredible new advancements, and war had been absent for so long that it was virtually forgotten. But ten years ago, the sun went black during an unexplained eclipse, and in that moment of darkness, every horror imaginable crawled from the shadows to prey upon the people of the Known Lands. This event became known as the Darkfall, and it changed the face of the world forever. Ten years later, the world of Aden still fights for survival. The creatures created by the Darkfall, known as Nocturnals, have destroyed countless hundreds of settlements, tens of thousands of lives, and brought entire nations to ruin. Every day brings a sigh of relief that the world has survived, and every nightfall brings another threat that it may end. And yet, there is hope. Those who fight against the Darkfall are not necessarily heroes, for there are many who seek to preserve Aden for their own purposes. Regardless, however, the common folk look upon them as leaders and inspiration, because the struggle for their survival is a desperate one. Foremost among the warriors who take the field against the evil plaguing the land are those who possess the power of mechamagic, either in the form of a mechamage, who commands a powerful golem to do his bidding, or a golemoid warrior, whose body has been modified to possess steam-powered weapons built right into their flesh. Others, including the technology-creating steamwright and the survivors of the divinatory Seer order, are only a few of those who hope to save Aden from an evil that no one yet understands. In Thunderscape, your character can fight against the hordes of nocturnals spawned by the Darkfall in a desperate attempt to win back the vast stretches of wasteland lost over the course of years. Or you can defend the few remaining settlements from your enemies, both nocturnals and mortal. You can take up the banner of Urbana and forge new trade routes across the Known Lands, or you can fight against the oppressive regime of Lord Urbane in hopes of liberating the people from his brand of 'necessary tyranny.' You can plumb the depths of the Burning Coast in hopes of retrieving lost treasures, or search for the mysteries of the lost creators of Le'Ciel. Hunt giants in the deep jungles of the Misland Republics, or fight off necromantic incursions from the Gray Isles as part of Arasteen's Radiant Order. The possibilities are limitless! “In my mind, Thunderscape: the World of Aden is one of the best campaign setting books released, and if I had anything bad to say about it, it would be that 224 pages left me wanting more…” – Jere M., DriveThruRPG   “This book is great! I wasn't familiar with the history of the world of Aden until I picked this up, but I'm quite glad that Kyoudai Games got their hands on the rights. The book has some pretty amazing magi-tech related material: from people with cybernetic implants to airships and tanks, this book probably has what you are looking for.” – James Langley, Paizo.com   “I'm a big fan of mixing magic and technology. I love properties like He-Man, Thundercats and Flash Gordon so for a while I was on a huge lookout for products that would satisfy my need to run a few Magitech or Dungeon Punk campaigns. Thunderscape is the book that satisfied me in ways that other similar products didn't.” – Malwing, Paizo.com   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSavage Thunderscape is a complete campaign setting and mechanics sourcebook for the Savage Worlds role-playing game. It details the World of Aden, including eleven different races (including the standard human, elf, and dwarf that so many fantasy aficionados love), twelve unique nations, and countless different groups and organizations that are perfect for a party of enterprising adventurers to be a part of. Editing is still in progress, so we can’t give you an exact page count just yet, but the final product of Savage Thunderscape will be a full-color, 8.5’ by 11’ work with a high quality and density of artwork designed specifically for our setting. When Kyoudai Games first brought Thunderscape back to tabletop gaming, we utilized the Pathfinder system. Since that time, though, the most frequent question we’ve been asked is whether or not we were going to create a Savage Worlds version. Our initial Kickstarter reached a stretch goal that would allow for a free conversion guide to Savage Worlds, but the writer we contracted to write 5,000 words ended up producing 50,000! Finally we admitted that it seems the universe wants this book to happen. And why shouldn’t it? Both are creations of Shane Hensley, after all. The World of Aden was created and developed by Shane Hensley in the mid 1990s as the setting for two computer games, three novels, and two role-playing supplements. Many years later, Shane would go on to develop Savage Worlds with much the same emphasis on vibrant, exciting experiences for everyone involved. Uniting Thunderscape and Savage Worlds is a perfect opportunity to pay homage to the man’s vision while simultaneously spreading our deep and abiding love of the setting to more people. The members of Kyoudai Games have been playing RPGs set in Aden for literally two decades, using all manner of different systems. We’ve had the time of our lives, and we want to share that with you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an extremely important section so please read this carefully! Barring the achievement of some really high-end stretch goals, we are not producing a line of printed books as part of this Kickstarter. Rather, if you back at a level that would give you access to a physical copy of the book, you gain the ability to purchase an at-cost print-on-demand copy. That’s why the increase from PDF to physical copy is only $5, because you will still have to pay the printing cost and the shipping cost for that book. Make no mistake, paying for printing is a lot less than a normal book’s cost, but we do want you to be aware of what you’re getting for your money. For example, one of our 48 page adventure modules has an actual print cost of about $8, which is significantly less than the cover price.\n\nWith regard to shipping, you may want to investigate how close the nearest Lightning Media printing facility is (that is the company we use through DriveThruRPG). The closer you are to one of their outlets, the less shipping will cost you. We know that they have European facilities, so that should save a tremendous amount on shipping if you are a European backer. It may seem a little bit unusual, but we believe that this process will actually save you money if you are interested in a physical copy. Many of you are likely familiar with the quality of work that DriveThru print-on-demand services provide, and the sheer volume of shipping that they do, even internationally, will allow them to offer you a less expensive rate. Of course, if you’re just interested in a PDF, please disregard this entire disclaimer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Add-on Menu: These may be selected by any backer! \nThunderscape: the World of Aden, Pathfinder Edition PDF: $10 (normally $20!) \nThunderscape Pathfinder Edition Ultimate Bundle: $50 (normally $117!) This includes all fourteens products from our Pathfinder line, including the core rulebook up through our April release, Heroes of Aden, all at a better than 50% discount! \nDeck of Thunderscape Playing Cards, at-cost print-on-demand: $5! (With this, you may purchase a deck for the cost of printing, which is between $4 and $5, and the cost of shipping it to your house.) \nUnique Thunderscape Fiction: $25! You can create your own Thunderscape character in either system and the Kyoudai Games Creative Team will write a fiction about your character, based on your requests! If we get enough of these we will compile them into an epub file, which will be free to all participants, and offer it for sale on Amazon! \n Physical Add-on Menu: These items are restricted to our Misari Giantslayer backers and above in order to consolidate physical items with the shipments we're already sending you! \nThunderscape T-Shirt: $10! \nDeck of Thunderscape Playing Cards: $10! \nThunderscape Bumper Sticker: $5! \nThunderscape Bumper Pin: $1! \n The Thunderscape Playing Card Deck is something new that we're working on right now. The design is not yet final, but here's a glimpse of what Mike \"Mad Max\" Brodu has been working on so far. Witness the Queen of Hearts! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this is our second Kickstarter, we learned a great deal about the proper preparation of stretch goals. To be honest, we were surprised by the level of success we experienced in our first one, and as a result we had to scramble to put some stretch goals together at the last minute. That led to some choices that we perhaps might not have made if we had considered it longer! As a result, we have more stretch goals planned out than you can possibly achieve, just in case. For now, however, here are the first few.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for your help! Let’s get Savage!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaching this level of funding means that we will immediately commission conversions of our two Thunderscape Vistas settings, the Mechamagical Academy and the Besieged Village, upon conclusion of the Kickstarter. No waiting for them to be paid for by sales! You get them as soon as we can get them converted and laid out, thanks to your generosity! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs above, this goal means that we will immediately convert and lay out the Savage Worlds conversion of our two Thunderscape Nights mini-modules, Trouble at the Dunswood Inn and Mission of Mercy! No waiting around, they get converted immediately, and like many other items on this list, are free to backers at level $20 and above! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first great adventure in the Lost Lexicon series, Heart of the Machine, will be converted immediately upon conclusion of the Kickstarter! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the most popular types of characters in Thunderscape are the Golemoids, men and women who have given up parts of their body to be replaced with mechamagical steam-powered weaponry, and the Thunder Scouts, who roam the wastelands in steam-powered vehicles, bringing order to the chaos brought by the Darkfall! Ready to get Savage with these guys? More options, more steam, more everything! No waiting for it to be paid for by sales, it's paid for now! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediate commissioning of the first in our series of Thunderscape World books, the Radiant Order! Curious about the egalitarian paladins who rule the nation of Arasteen? Here's everything you need to know! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediate commissioning of the first installment of our Aden Wildlife Journals! Read the bickering expertise of Dr. Danderfall Malcolm of Mekanus and his BFF Professor Atticus Caesar of Refuge! Learn all the secrets of the goreaux race! Learn about the enigmatic salamanders that hide away beneath the smoking volcanoes of the Charred Peaks! And learn all the horrible truths six of Aden's most dangerous and deadly creatures! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediate commissioning of the second Lost Lexicon adventure, Radiant Demise! What horrible secrets are hidden in the history of Arasteen? Where will the path of the lost lexicon lead next? What is causing the breakdown of diplomacy between mankind and the secretive slurgithians? Find out here! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, who’s making this thing anyway? Well, as you know, the setting and system were both originally created by Shane Hensley, which might explain why they seem to mesh together so well. However, since Kyoudai Games got the rights to Aden from Shane Hensley, all creative direction has been handled by Shawn Carman and Rich Wulf, both of whom you may know from their days working on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG and RPG (and Rich also wrote an amazing trilogy of Eberron novels for Wizards of the Coast!). Shawn and Rich are operating largely in an oversight capacity on Savage Thunderscape, however, helping provide direction and guidance to ensure all mechanics mesh with the themes of Thunderscape as it currently exists, a delicious blend of old-school Hensley innovation and modern role-playing advancements. For our Savage Worlds mechanics, we turned to a couple of long-standing members of the Savage Worlds community, Mark Swafford and John Beattie. These two gentlemen have done an amazing job of taking the spirit of the World of Aden and translating it into the fast, furious fun of Savage Worlds. You’ll be seeing a lot more of these guys in the months and years to come, I’ll wager. And of course we would be remiss if we did not mention the wonderful Jodi Black of Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Jodi has been a mentor to us as we work to ensure that our game is 100% worthy of the mantle of Savage Worlds, and with every suggestion she offered us she included ample amounts of encouragement as well, for which we will forever be in her debt. Thanks, Jodi! I would go on for pages about the amazing graphic design skills of our layout guy, Mike Brodu, but I don’t have to. You’ll see the pages and you’ll know this man is a champion among designers. It’s going to be amazing.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges This is not Kyoudai Games’ first Kickstarter. It’s our second! And in the execution of our first, we learned a great deal about the process of fulfillment and, to be perfectly frank with you, what not to do when promising things to our backers. We have constructed this Kickstarter very meticulously to ensure that we can deliver 100% of the items we promise in the manner we have promised. Like our previous endeavor, the text for this particular book is already complete and in editing as this Kickstarter launches. Unlike last time, however, we are not adding material directly to the core book as a result of the backer levels, so we can have the text ready for backers to review as soon as the Kickstarter ends. (The exception to that being the special edition version, which will have additional items, hence its arrival date being several months behind the basic release. Extra chapters, don't you know!)\n\nDelays are possible, because frankly there’s always something that can be overlooked or complications that can arise that no one could have predicted. We’ve been doing this for a little while now, though, and we’re ready to deal with whatever gets in our way. And you can ask any of our former backers… sometimes we run a little slow, but we always live up to our promises. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Why No Man is an Island ? Stories like this come along once in a generation. And the story behind our proposed film is perhaps one of the greatest of the generation of our parents and grandparents who valiantly fought tyranny and oppression during the hard years of the Second World War in Greece. But ours isn't one of resistance, sabotage and bombs and bullets-- against the occupier. No Man is an Island is a story of soft power-- the victory of humanity over hatred; and, compassion over cruelty. Our short film will tell the story-- the survival story that is unique in all of Europe -- of the only Jewish community that didn't lose a single soul during the Holocaust. It is a story of heroism that needs to be told-- not only for future generations, but for the current one. International Interest The project and the story of the Jews of Zakynthos have already generated international attention and media publicity in Greece, the United States, Canada, Mexico and beyond in major newspapers and media outlets. The story was even the topic of conversation between the Prime Ministers of Greece and Israel recently when the two met. We have also been featured in: \n\nShalom Life , Canada's largest online Jewish publication\n \n\nKathimerini , one of Greece's top daily newspapers \n Meet the Team Producers For producer Gregory Pappas , Zakynthos is personal. After hearing the survival story from his Cretan father as a teenager, Greg first uncovered testimony about Zakynthos while studying at the American College of Greece in Athens. He's dreamed of making a film ever since. In the last two years, Greg has produced two Cannes Short Film Corner films (Foreigner , Dichotomous ), a feature-length personal documentary (Hello Anatolia ), and a soon-to-be-released short starring Olympia Dukakis . With co-producer and DP Steven Priovolos , he recently circumnavigated the globe for a new TV series featuring adventure-seeker and kindness-champion Leon Logothetis. When he’s not producing films, Greg runs the Greek America Foundation , heads an event-planning firm called the Pappas Media Group , and writes for the Huffington Post . He also speaks regularly about Greece’s role during World War II, an era he has studied and researched extensively. We’re thrilled that No Man Is an Island has also attracted the support of the former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Sid Ganis . As an Executive Producer, Ganis will lend advice and support on how to overcome the challenges of shooting a complex period film in a foreign country. \n\n\nProducers Gregory Pappas and Steven Priovolos, with Executive Producer Sid Ganis \n \n\n \nDirector Raised in Venezuela, director Joel Novoa  is passionate about films that both entertain and convey a social-political message. Which is why NO MAN IS AN ISLAND felt like a perfect fit for Variety Magazine's rising Latin-American star . A recent graduate of the American Film Institute, Joel just completed his debut feature, “ESCLAVO DE DIOS” (“GOD’S SLAVE”), inspired by the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association. Joel has worked on shorts and features in places like Venezuela, Argentina, Spain, Uruguay, Los Angeles, and Israel. His films have been recognized with selections and honors at more than 30 film festivals worldwide, including Cannes and the Los Angeles Shorts Fest. Director of Photography  Award-winning cinematographer Steven Priovolos has signed on to shoot the film, in addition to his contribution as a producer. Born in Athens, Steven has worked on commercials, short films, and feature projects throughout the world, including the Greek features 180 Degrees and Kiss of Life . Have a closer look at Steven’s work here: http://www.stevendp.com Screenwriter Already called a \"masterpiece\" by some of the top names in Hollywood who have read it, the script was penned by British screenwriter Mia Christou . Mia has worked professionally as a published author, writer, producer and actress. Her background in theatre includes a Bachelor of Arts in Drama and English. Recently, her feature script Lines in the Sand attracted the attention of Kennedy/Marshall and Sam Mendes, among others. Production Designer Two-time Art Director’s Guild nominee Giles Masters  will be handling production design duties. Recognized for his art directing work in The Da Vinci Code , the Mummy franchise, and Tomorrow Never Dies , Giles brings over thirty years of experience to our short film.\n \n\n\nConcept art from another of Giles' WWII projects \n \n\n \nSet Photographer Born in Tel Aviv, Roy Schweiger is an accomplished fashion photographer whose work has been showcased in Milan, Cannes, and his home city. He has also served as an in house backstage photographer for DSQUARED2 since 2007. In addition to volunteering his time as a set photographer, Roy has painstakingly researched, located, and met with Greek Jewish survivors from Zakynthos.  His photographs speak to an eye for turning any location into his own stage. \n\n\nJewish Zakynthos survivors located and photographed by Roy Schweiger \n \n\n \nLocation, Location, Location \n\n\n\n\n\nThe true story behind No Man Is an Island played out on Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea. We plan to shoot some of the film on location in Zakynthos. In light of a 1953 earthquake that destroyed most of the World War II-era architecture on the island, we’ve identified the city of Chania in Crete as a primary stand-in for key Zakynthos exteriors. Since Greg's family is from Chania, our film will have plenty of local support. \n\n\nThe 15th century synagogue of Etz Hayim on Crete matches period architecture on Zakynthos. \n \n\n \nBudget Our budget is more than $165,000 to shoot the short film in Greece and ultimately submit it to festivals throughout the world. We have already raised half of this budget from major donors from a community of people around the world, like you! This Kickstarter campaign is designed to raise $25,000 and build a bigger army of support for this project.   In Conclusion! Our message is timeless.  No Man is an Island will share the largely unknown and untold story of how two men and 35,000 citizens of a Greek Island stood on the side of goodness and humanity when they stared evil in the face. No Man is an Island  is a film that must be made. It is a story that must be told. With your help, this can become a reality. Remember-- your support is tax-deductible. The Greek America Foundation is a non-profit organization. We thank for your support and cannot wait to start shooting in 2014.\n Sincerely,Gregory Pappas & Steven Priovolos Producers PS: We are also grateful for the support we've received from our friends for other projects. This year, we successfully completed our \"Greeks of Hollywood\" Kickstarter campaign that involved the exhibition of an important collection of memorabilia. This exhibition is now in the process of being digitized and transformed into a website for the entire world to see. Estimated delivery of the Greeks of Hollywood website is Summer 2014. \n\n\nThese and other great vintage posters will be digitized for our Greeks of Hollywood website that our Kickstarter supporters made possible \n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Greeks of Hollywood exhibition at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood the weekend of May 29th 2013 \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges Risks and challenges include all issues that could arise in pre-production with regards to preparation for the film, including but not limited to location scouting issues, talent booking and overall scheduling of crew and cast. We will overcome this challenge by hiring professional below the line producers with experience in such projects to successfully manage all components of the project from the onset.

    "textDescription": "Story Dancing  Classrooms Greater Richmond is a 501 c 3 Non Profit   founded in 2012 to bring the Dancing Classrooms program to the entire Greater Richmond area. We are currently collaborating with Richmond Public Schools, and concluded a successful Pilot at Swasnboro Elementary School in December 2012. We will offer the program in another two RPS Elementary schools this semester, and plan to expand further into RPS amd the rest of GRVA.  In 2013 , we will also be able to take the program to middle schools. If you've seen the documentary Mad Hot Ballroom or the feature film\nwith Antonio Banderas , Take the Lead ,\nthen you know the Dancing Classrooms story, and you know the positive\ndifference Dancing Classrooms makes in the lives of children, parents, schools\nand their communities. Founder\nPierre Dulaine started Dancing Classrooms almost 20 years ago by volunteering\nin one New York City School. From that single school, Dancing Classrooms has\ngrown to serve over 40,000 children in over 500 schools in more than\ntwenty-five locations across the country and around the world.  Our mission is to build\nsocial awareness, confidence and self-esteem in children through the practice\nof social dance. Through standards-based, in-school residencies, we use the\nvocabulary of ballroom dance to cultivate the positive feelings that are\ninherent in every child. The maturity necessary to dance together fosters\nrespect, teamwork, confidence and a sense of joy and accomplishment which we\nhope to bring to every child. Based on a holistic\napproach to build confidence and team work, stretch creative skills and support\nacademic excellence, Dancing Classrooms uses the rich and varied vocabularies of\nsocial dance to increase cooperation, to improve concentration, and to explore\nareas of commonality, understanding and cultural awareness. \n\nScrupulous attention to program\nquality and professional development ensures consistent delivery of the Dancing\nClassrooms program and maximum benefit to students and schools. In other words,\nwhat you see in Mad Hot Ballroom is\nwhat you get in every Dancing Classrooms school. Studies have shown that\nparticipation in Dancing Classrooms results in positive impact on key\nindicators of social and academic success. Post-residency interviews show\nconsistent high levels of satisfaction with the Dancing Classrooms program\namong students, classroom teachers, school administrators and parents. Risks and challenges Once funding is secured, the key challenge is deciding which School District and school to offer the program to. We have been working with Richmond Pubic Schools thus far, and have their endorsement and agreement to expand the program. Our intent would be to offer a Pilot to one or more additional School Districts in the Greater Richmond area in order to drive awareness in the community. The hurdle will be gaining access to decision makers in these school districts and securing their endorsement, but we are collaborating with Communities in Schools and are certain that with their help this hurdle can be overcome. If it cannot , we will use the funds to bring the program to another school in RPS this year. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Project In 2004, I made my first road trip photographing across rural Greece. I was searching for the “real” Greece, not the places tourism had altered but places where people still worked the earth and celebrated traditions. My Greek was okay and so I stopped, asked questions of strangers, took photos, wrote stories and made friends along the way. Narratives poured forth in the quiet light of a 6 a.m. milking—in numerous images that witnessed the slow integration of 21st century ways into rural lives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 years later, I have hundreds of photographs and a pile of notebooks filled with narratives and impressions. Now the whole story begs to be told. Imagine! The many voices speaking out in an 80-100 page book—a book that reaches beyond the stereotypical image the media presents of the Greek people. Beyond stories of riots in Athens and headlines heralding the crisis of debt. Now, more than ever before, Greece needs to be recognized for its spectacular landscape, the richness of the culture and strength of the Greek people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy book, “Daily Bread: Stories from Rural Greece” will immerse you in the everyday lives of farmers, bakers, sheepers, fishermen­, people living simple lives in small villages across Greece. In my photos and stories, I have reached for the moments that distill the essence of character and occasion, moments that celebrate the ancient traditions, the love of family, the courage and dignity of the people.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Photographs from “Daily Bread, Stories of Rural Greece,” have already been exhibited and well received at galleries and exhibition centers in the US and Greece as well as at the Greek Embassy in Washington, DC. I have printed and framed photos and launched numerous shows successfully in the past. I first began making photos and writing stories over 20 years ago so I've been at it just a little while!\n\nI am qualified and able to see this book through the details of printing to final publication but I need your help. Printing a fine-art book is an expensive process. Although work prints are already finished, the stories written and edited, I will need to print finished gelatin-silver prints in my darkroom and send each of these out for high-resolution scans. The book will be printed on a traditional off-set press to insure the highest standards of reproduction. This book will be a beautiful collection of handmade photos reproduced to exacting standards.\n\nSo please, give as generously as you can. Right now! Don’t wait. Even the smallest contribution will help me bring “Daily Bread” to life. Thank you for helping me to make this important book a reality.

    "textLength": 7976,
    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nProjecteo press coverage \n \n\n \n\nProjecteo is a tiny Instagram projector. It uses wheels of 35mm slide film you make online and each one holds nine photos. Whether they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've developed a process to get your Instagrams onto a single frame of 35mm Kodak film stock, which is cut into a circle and fits snugly inside a wheel.  To change wheels, just gently pull it out and place the next one in the slot. You will be able to collect as many wheels as you like. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo pixels, no pixelation. \n \nLike all projectors, Projecteo works best in the dark. We've had great looking images up to two and a half feet wide in a pitch black room. Unlike screens, slide film doesn't have pixels. This means you get beautiful looking images from a device the size of a matchbox. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functioning prototype \n\n\n\nSLS printed prototype \n \n\n \n\n\nWe started off by 3D printing early prototypes of Projecteo. Sure, it was rough and stuck together with tape but it had enough charm to make us fall in love with the idea. We wanted to see how far we could take it. \nThrough an iterative process, we optimised the focal length of the lenses and added a focusing mechanism. We looked for the most powerful LEDs we could find, made the batteries replaceable and figured out the perfect ratio of images per wheel. We modified the outside edges to give Projecteo a five degree chamfer, to make it a bit nicer to hold. Oh and of course, we gave it cute little feet. \n\nThough we had a prototype that did everything we wanted Projecteo to do, we were not ready for manufacturing. To take us through to that next step, we started working with Meso, a product development consultancy in Scotland. With their help and guidance, we made a production prototype. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now had a model with parts designed to be injection moulded and all components custom made to fit right in the case. The surface finishes are high gloss on top with a textured matte grey bottom. We now also had a production prototype circuit board, the miniaturised version of the electronics we would be able to make at scale. As a final touch, we made the button a bright, fire truck red. Buttons you want to press are always red. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a working production prototype, the beginnings of tooling and the first sample ready to be injection moulded, the hardware was coming together nicely. But we also had to figure out how you pick your images online. Luckily, we know a thing or two about that. How do you pick your images? \nMint Digital is an agency and product development company. We collaborate with startups to large companies to make digital products. We also invent, build and run our own ventures like Foldable.me and Stickygram , giving us quite a bit of an experience in connecting to Instagram and turning digital pixels into physical stuff. We've also learned a lot about fulfilment and shipping to the world. \nWe've already been hard at work on the web component of Projecteo and will continue to polish the experience. For now, here's a sneak peek. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do your pictures become slide film? \nOur developers in the US use a similar technique to how Hollywood convert digital movies to 35mm film to project in cinemas. Your Instagrams are 'melted' on to a single frame of Kodak film, which is then processed in a similar way to how analogue films are developed, except in full colour. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the development trays, we cut out individual sets using our custom circle cutter.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then place each unique piece into one of our wheels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrews, not glue Projecteo has been designed so you can disassemble it.  This will not only make them easier to recycle but it means you can pull it open and see what's going on inside. There, you will find a super bright LED, capacitors and resistors, a switch, a decade counter and three batteries. Feel free to hack away! We can't wait to see your creations. \nWhere will it be made? \nThe components will be sourced and injection moulded in China. The factory we are working with is in Guangdong city and adheres to all labour condition laws. It's run by a nice gentleman called Henry, who looks after his staff well. Assembly of Projecteo and the development of images will happen in upstate New York, at a professional photography lab run by a lovely man called Neil. He will take care of printing your Instagrams and popping them into wheels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will you have Projecteo? With successful funding, we will be able to make Projecteo between mid-December and mid-January. After manufacturing, units will be drop tested to the American standard and EU/FCC certified, which should take a maximum of two weeks. We'll then need to test our fulfilment process to make sure the Instagrams you choose on the site are matched with the physical wheels. \nOnce we have everything running smoothly, we should be able to roll out units to our first Kickstarter backers around late February. We will ship units in the order we receive the pledges, so back early to get Projecteo early! Something special for Kickstarter… The whole idea behind Projecteo came about when Ben found a Rollei film projector and a bunch of slides on a market stall. He fell in love with the beautiful and refined design of the projector and set about to find a way of getting his Instagrams onto slide film. In homage, we'd like to make 1000 limited edition Projecteos in the Rollei P35 colours. We will only ever make these available on Kickstarter. \n\n\nSpecial Kickstarter edition \n \n\n \n\nIt's been a long and difficult but fascinating journey so far, and we can't wait to get Projecteo into your hands. However, there are still a few bumps along the way and we need your help to get us there. \n\n\nThanks for taking a peek. \n \n\n \nProjecteo is a project by Mint Digital . With thanks to Meso Design . Risks and challenges There are inherent risks and challenges when developing any sort of product, be it physical or digital. When we mix the two, it gets slightly more complex. We've got a great team working on Projecteo with the right skills and experience to finish the job. Here is what we face in the upcoming months.\n\n1. Financial backing\nWithout your support, we can't cover the cost of tooling and get a handle on the minimum order quantity we should commit to for the first batch. We need your help to get us there.\n\n2. Refining the tool\nWe have made a pretty good start on this and produced some first samples. To get the tooling to the standard we require at volume will take more time, money and effort.\n\n3. Fulfilment\nThough we have our circle cutter, we will need to install it in the photography studio and look to set up an efficient and accurate fulfilment procedure to produce wheels at scale for Projecteo.\n\n4. Web\nThis part of the project is well underway. Making digital products is something we have the expertise in, but there are still tricky problems to solve. We'll keep working at it until we get the experience of creating your wheel just right.\n\n5. Rollout\nOnce we reach our funding goal, we'll need to send Projecteos to all our backers. This will involve shipping from China, assembly in the US, developing each individual film and wheel, boxing them up and sending them across the world. We have experience in this from our previous ventures, but Projecteo is just that much more complex. \n\nWe are looking to trickle units out in increasing volumes to test all our processes as we go and iron out any kinks as early as we can. With your support, we can tackle anything that comes our way and get Projecteo out in to the world.\n\nThanks for checking out our project and have an awesome day.\n\nBen and the Mint Digital team.

Everyone who pledges over $4 will get this awesome reward! \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Everyone who backs this project will get their name on the backer's page in Cyberines #1. Everyone! Cyberine, the USCC and Shadowflame. Cyberines #1 takes us to the next step of human evolution. We delve into the past of what turned one of the Cyberines into a deadly enemy. Was he always destined to be? We also introduce a new \"Villain\". The Persian freedom fighter Sirocco. Is he friend, or the worst type of foe? The story, is a simple one. When I was 14 years old I created my Captain America mixed with The Six Million Dollar Man  hero, Cyberine . That is 1985 to you young pups. In Bergen Tech Print Shop, Mr. Pavlu tasked us with creating a flyer for something that interested us. Me being a huge comic fan and also had just read Captain America with Deathlok, I created a character to be in that vein. I was also very patriotic as a teen. I still am.  Cyberine made his first appearance alongside Agent Napalm in Shadowflame #2(1996/2007) to arrest Billy Barnes, also knows as KillWatt the Electrocutioner. He was hired by Don Tony Baltinetti to kill Shadowflame for disrespecting his nephew Tommy.  The Cyberines, or United States Cyberine Corps made their first full appearance in Shadowflame #4 (1997/2007)  where they helped Shadowflame fight and defeat Maldestrak.  Cyberine was in a tragic accident that required the government to make him better, stronger and faster. The cost was a helluva lot more than $6 million dollars.\n The Cyberines follows a \"family\" of Cybernetic Marines. They are the top tier of elite combat class of soldier: the USCC , the United States Cyberine Corps . Their members are recruited and trained at a young age and then cybernetically or genetically enhanced. This can be due to an accident or injury that has occurred in the line of duty or just to unlock their genetic potential. \n\n\nCyberines #1 cover by Cory Hamscher and Sean Forney \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nJoe, Jeff and Sean's cover. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cyberines first appeared in the Shadowflame mini-series from 1996. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nI no longer have the first Cyberine drawing that I did. But this is from 1986! \n \n\n \n\n\nSpecial thanks to the creative team, Cory Hamscher, Pow Rodrix, Sean Forney, Ed Dukeshire DW from Fanboysinc and R.J. Michaels.  Risks and challenges The book is 99% done. It needs to be lettered and printed. This will mean that the book will be in your hands soon after the Kickstarter is over.

    "textDescription": "Story ABOUT US:  Fresh & Local is a movement to\nfacilitate urban farming in Mumbai.  We started in the spring of 2010, in\nreaction to the lack of fresh and organic produce, and the lack of resources\nand support for urban farming in the city.  We research and develop best\npractices, design gardens and garden products, host gardening workshops and\nwork in partnership with NGOs and individuals to set up kitchen gardens across\nthe city.\n\nFresh and Local’s Flyover Farm project is a natural\nprogression and culmination of the work currently being carried out. THE CHALLENGE:  We want to transform 5,000 sqft of\nunused rooftop into an exemplar urban farm and community space.  The Farm\nis located atop a low income, mixed-use building on the busiest street in\nMumbai.  There is no source for organic produce or any green, open space\nin walking distance from the building.  We hope that by showing it is\npossible to grow food in a densely urbanized area with limited resources we\nwill inspire others to start growing (some of) their own food in the\nunderutilized spaces that surround them. Turning this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(view larger) Into THIS: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(view larger) The Flyover Farm will: \nGrow organic fruits, herbs and vegetables \nCompost kitchen waste \nSell produce through the rooftop grocery \nHost workshops to educate and expose city dwellers to the possibilities of urban farming and train urban farmers \nResearch, design and develop best practices for rooftop farming \nServe as an outdoor community and activity space for building residents \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(view larger) THE\nHARVEST:  We will grow lots of herbs like\nbasil (Italian and Indian varieties), lemongrass, fenugreek, coriander, curry\nleaf, chives, ginger and garlic.  In the\nsummer we will grow vegetables like okra, eggplant, peppers, cucumber and\ngourds, and in the winter spinach, beets and lettuces.  Our fruit trees include banana, mango,\nstarfruit, chikoo, lime and lemon. \n\nTHE QUESTIONS:  How much food can we grow in 5,000sqft\nof roof space?  How many people will this\nfeed?  How many jobs will this\ncreate?  How financially feasible is it\n(in Mumbai) to convert rooftops into community farms?  Fresh & Local plans to develop a model\nthat others can replicate and will share all information and findings on our website\nand publications. KICKSTARTER FUNDING:  The Flyover Farm will make use of about 5,000sqft of rooftop.  Phase 1 will focus on half the roof (2,500 sqft) and requires $5,500 (just over  $2 per square foot)  to be successfully completed. To date the Farm has a 20 sqft vegetable and herb garden, 15 fruit trees, over 50 ornamental plants and weekly yoga classes. In Phase 1 we will add: \nApproximately 750 sqft of elevated vegetable and herb growing space \n20 fruit trees \nShaded plant nursery, grocery and vertical garden structure \nShaded activity and workshop spaces with tables and seating \nStorage shed for tools and garden materials \nComposting Unit \n The $5,500 budgeted will be used to cover the costs of: \nSoil and potting mix (about 1000 cubic feet) \nSeedlings and fruit trees \nRooftop-friendly growing containers \n2 shade structures made from natural materials (materials and labor) \nVertical garden structure (materials and labor) \nTables and seating (refurbished second-hand pieces) \nComposting Unit \nTool Shed (made of discarded building materials) \nBasic gardening tools and drums for storage \n Any additional funds raised will go towards Phase 2 (on the second half of the roof), to be carried out in October after the monsoon.  In Phase 2 we will add an additional 1500 sqft of vegetable and herb growing space, build an amrut mithi (soil) making station, expand the composting unit, start urban bee keeping and begin our mali (gardener) training program. WHY MUMBAI:  Mumbai is one of the largest and most\ndensely populated cities in the world.  As the city grows in size and\npopulation, open spaces and farmable land disappear.  Access to quality,\nnutrient-rich and fresh food is an ever growing problem for all residents,\nespecially the city's poor.  On average food prices have increased by 11%\nsince last year.  Produce travels about 5 days before it reaches markets\nand approximately 40% of produce is lost from farm to table.  Because of\nthis, produce is often harvested before it is ripe to prevent spoiling, and\nharmful chemicals such as Ethylene and Ethephon are used to artificially ripen\nit.  Both these chemicals are known to cause neurological damage. India, along with Nepal, Bangladesh and Ethiopia, has the\nhighest percentage of undernourished children in the world.  In India,\nurban children are more likely to be malnourished than children in rural\nareas.  This is due to a number of factors, one of which is the\nunavailability of fresh produce that contains proper nutritional content. Growing food locally, in the vast amounts of useable space\n(flat, open rooftops and terraces) in urban Mumbai can begin to address the\nproblem of a lack of access, due to affordability and availability, of quality\nproduce.  Additionally, transport time and costs are drastically reduced,\nand little to no energy resources or packaging is needed to store produce from\nthe time it is harvested to sold.  Urban agriculture also holds the\npotential to raise awareness about organic food growing practices, healthy\neating habits, and provides beautiful, green outdoor spaces for city dwellers\nto enjoy.  THE FRESH & LOCAL TEAM:  Nicola Antaki, Naheed\nCarimjee, Nanda Kumar, Matthew Nelson, Liam Rees, Adrienne Thadani and\ncountless volunteers. We thank you for your support and are incredibly grateful\nfor your help in making this project possible!

    "title": "Faithful: A Lesbian Mormon Story",

    "hasHeaderVideo": true,
    "videoLength": 86,
    "descriptionMediaNumber": 2,
    "textLength": 4894,
    "textDescription": "Story Our Film's Journey Faithful was born out of the need to better understand lesbian Mormons. Over the past several decades, at least 20 movies and documentaries have been made about the gay Mormon experience, but almost no films have been made about Mormon lesbians. This is a story we want to tell. Some of you may be wondering –– do lesbian Mormons even exist? The short answer is YES, although for those who are living on the intersection where faith and orientation are at odds, the world can feel lonely and bleak. Our goal in making this film is to tell an honest story and to foster compassion and conversation around the lived experiences of LGBT+ people. Some live in communities that may have had limited exposure to diversity and as a result, may resist understanding their hearts.  It is through spending time with people different from us that we have the chance to cast aside our own misconceptions and learn to love everyone more fully. Now, more than ever, is the time to raise awareness and understanding of those whose orientation may conflict with their faith.  What is the Film About? Join us on a journey with Lauralie and her best friend and roommate, Marylu, to experience the joys and pains that any couple in a committed relationship might have –– but with the addition of being fully committed to a religion that is defined largely by heterosexuality. For many people, their religion is the basis for understanding their existence and purpose. However, since much of Mormonism is rooted in a heteronormative paradigm, many LGBT+ Mormons are left despairing as they wholeheartedly seek to practice their religion but also wish to find love and companionship with a person of the same gender. Throughout the decades, they have either stayed in the Church and downplayed their need for companionship or have left the Church and found companionship and existential meaning elsewhere. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Marylu and Lauralie  Being Mormon is a big part of who they are. Marylu comes from many generations of Mormons who crossed the plains, and Lauralie was once married in the temple to a man. Together, they live in the plateaus of eastern Utah in Roosevelt, a town of 6700 people. This is a tight-knit community made even tighter by the fact that almost everyone practices the same religion: Mormonism. A large part of being Mormon is believing that marriage transcends mortal life into the eternities and that couples who marry in the Mormon temple can be with each other and their posterity, forever. In order to achieve this highest reward everyone must also follow strict rules in this life. \n\nMarylu and Lauralie are following these rules as closely as possible. They are also in love and dream that they too can be together forever. A same-gender couple, however, is not permitted to marry in the temple. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Will My Contribution Do? We have spent the last year making this film and are now in the final stages of editing. A contribution to this project will go directly toward production costs of the film––travel, accommodation, music, equipment, pizza, etc. But more importantly, a contribution to this project means supporting a film that has potential to build understanding and open hearts.  We have big plans to screen this film in the festival circuit and in community screenings in California, Utah, and beyond. The more people who see the film the better! We’ve calculated into our production costs what it will take to reach these screening goals and we’re confident we will reach them. We are hopeful that this story will increase understanding in the hearts of those who watch it and offer an important window into the lives of lesbian Mormons. If you've wanted to support a cause that can impact many people for the better, now is the time to contribute! Who are the Filmmakers?\n\n Dane Christensen grew up in Utah and is a second-year in the Documentary Film & Video MFA program at Stanford University. His filmmaking is rooted in the belief that the stories we tell can make change happen. His impetus for making this film comes from the urgent need to understand, empathize, and support our LGBT+ Mormon brothers and sisters.\n\n Jenn Lee Smith was born into the Mormon faith in Taiwan and was raised partly in rural Utah. She worked in academia for over 10 years and pursued a PhD that focused on telling the stories of women migrants. Jenn Lee is a life-long student of film and writing, and strives to give voice to those who have yet to be heard.\n Risks and challenges What if the project isn't fully funded? Since this is Dane's thesis film, he needs to finish it in order to graduate. And Dane really wants to graduate! If the kickstarter isn't fully funded, the project will continue to be self-funded by Dane. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Sports and outdoor activity drink bottles have become very popular, there has been some good successes. We are not afraid of this competition as the Intelishake has a better, design, function and look , we realised that there was more that could be done to make drink bottles more useful and provide some useful function to your high energy active sessions whilst remaining in the same price bracket .   Intelishake will provide that missing element, with added compartments which if you decide not to use, can be unscrewed and bottle made shorter into a regular drink bottle. Design was important to us because consumers want more for their money these days and what better than to buy a product that fits in with their style and trend requirements. We estimate that by the time we sell 2000 pcs, we will be able to bring the cost of each unit down to $9.99 each and $14.99 delivered worldwide to your door. That makes our product a serious contender with other drink bottles on the shelf! At this unit price, there are usually no customs or import charges in most countries as it falls within low value goods categorization making it exempt and therefore no unexpected bills on delivery from the tax office in the USA, Europe, Canada or Australia. \n\nWhat We Need, and Why \n\nNewtonstein\n– that’s the name of our start-up company – has already spent over $10,000 of\nour own funds in the development of this project, which has enabled us to\ncreate a variety of prototypes, apply for our patent, pay for legal fees, set\nup of logistics and choose a packing operation in Switzerland. Read the inventor's brief diary on processes we went through to set up here. \n\nWe\nrequire an additional $20,000 to meet the shortfall for tooling costs and\nproduction of a starting order of 1000 pieces. This is where you come in and get to grab the opportunity of becoming one of the first backers to put your hands on one! We are not setting any limits, because the more we get funded, the more we can spend on new variations and trade shows to establish this product in global markets whilst putting a team in place to drive its growth through retail distribution! All quotations for tooling and manufacturing ready, we got our final prototypes made by the same factory to ensure they are familiar with the product long term. We have numerous distributors and retailers already showing interest in stocking this product but they require finished product samples, we strongly believe that through this process of crowd funding, we will be able to successfully secure large orders long term once our product comes to life. The challenge is simply to be able to produce our Intelishake in bulk quantities, which will enable us to charge a competitive price . For that reason, funding from our friends at Kickstarter is essential to launch the Intelishake properly. The entire process of crowd funding will inevitably help us learn a great deal more about our market, our product and our direction for the future because your critical appraisal and feedback will help us perfect our invention, after all, it is you that will make use of it the most! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Journey We came up with sketches Prototype 1 of Intelishake as shown below, and started looking at perfecting design 3 months ago, reducing costs as the initial design with aluminium casing would cost $75 each. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the $10 - $20 price range\n . Our revisions produced Prototype 2 which was cool, sleek and trendy. Once we got this in our hands we collectively agreed that it was slightly large with 8.5 cm diameter. Finally we settled on Prototype 3 as shown on all our images which was slimmer at 7.7cm diameter and shorter at around 30cm.\n\n We modified the middle compartment to make it the same size as the top liquid compartment, this would remove the need for a separate moulding tool saving $5000 on cost of manufacturing whilst allowing middle compartment logos to be etched or printed on.  From our campaign and product feedback, we decided to include the carbon water filter which is an easy snap on snap off option. The final version is made primarily from Blow Moulding significantly reducing the unit cost of this product and making it possible to put it on the shelf of retailers quicker and cost effectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards & Goals Most of our rewards start off with the Green Grasshopper colour as the shipped bottle, but if you want a different colour, please place and order and then once its funded, email us to swap the colour! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our very special beach towel merchandise shipped with eligible orders! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Newtonstein Team \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriyesh  is the founder of Newtonstein, and is one of the two\ninventors for this small business.  He\nhas run commerce operations and designed bespoke ecommerce systems for\nmarketplace selling.

It lives above the garage, is finished and heated, and spacious enough to create the dyelab of my dreams and to host sizable workshops in dyeing and many other skills in fiber arts: felting, spinning, knitting, and fiber preparation. \nThe space needs tools and comfort in order to get started as a real Lab and Lounge. It wants to be a place not only for formal workshops, but for informal gatherings and for drop-in help and tool exploration. Whether it be a workshop with myself or another knowledgeable instructor, a quick lesson, or a weekly knitting/fiber craft night, The Spun Monkey Dyeworks and Lounge wants to be a local destination for fiber enthusiasts in southern Vermont as well as a beautiful space worthy of traveling to for a weekend workshop. \nHelp us turn this empty space into a real Dyeworks Lab and Lounge! Some new equipment, work tables and storage solutions will allow The Spun Monkey to be more productive with our own output, but also to have the space and materials required to share skills with others in an environment conducive to instruction, with elbow room and shared tools in a warm and friendly space. \nCarders, dyepots, dye materials, spindles, a teaching wheel, furniture (including worktables for felting)...are things the Lab and Lounge needs to fill the space with in order to offer the services we would like to provide.

Rob was saddened to learn that modern-day  Scooby Doo now fights actual monsters and has lost that magic of teaching kids to watch for those with power and means to do harm. Rob being Inspired by this loss of integrity in something he was a fan of and the FANTASTIC Art of CGhirardo's , Rob turned  Classic MONSTERS into REAL PEOPLE with believable back stories and used them to Expose the real Monsters of Life,  those who constantly affect everyday people without care, The Greedy and Corprotasied Americans who seek to rule the world at any cost or loss of life, so long as it does not negatively affect profits  THE STORY   In Naples  Florida, our \"Monsters\" have made a quiet life and faded into obscurity.  The \"Monsters\" consist of the  Invisible Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein, and Dracula who are real people, not Monsters,  with unfortunate misconceptions about who they are thanks to the silver screen.  The local police think they know who they are, based on the silver screen, despite not being anything like their Hollywood myths.  When dead bodies beginning showing up around them it doesn't take long for the police to try to pin the deaths on the \"Monsters\".  These so-called\" MONSTERS\"  must act fast to clear their names and in the process will expose the REAL LIFE MONSTERS living freely under all of our noses.  How it all Came together Rob Andersin and CGhirardo wanted to work together and were trying to make a completely different comic at first. The Orginal Comic book Rob felt was not a good fit for CGhirardo's Art, but Rob was both inspired and inspired by CGhirardo's Artistic talent and wrote a 5 page story about Monsters to match his style and embrace it. The Preliminary art was drawn by CGhirardo and it quickly filled 5 pages with the beginning of an amazing story and suddenly a longer story was born out of enjoyment of creating by both writer and artist. By the time all was said and done a 32-page Comic had been created in a couple of months. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n  Who is CGhirardo A graduate of the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, Inc., artist CGhirardo sees comics as art and looks to experiment and push the boundaries and limits of the medium to its full potential.

    "textDescription": "Story what is YEMANJA? \n\nYEMANJA is a very special travel destination in the Caribbean. Founded by two Caribbean women, it is a restaurant, bar and hostel in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Named in honor of the mythical Caribbean mermaid, YEMANJA will open its doors in December, 2012. where is Bocas del Toro? Bocas del Toro is a province on the Northeast coast of Panama, just an hour south of Costa Rica. The area is a popular travel destination with beautiful beaches, strong surf, gentle bays, jungle tours and wild birding. There are many different communities that reside in Bocas del Toro, and many languages spoken. YEMANJA is located on the edge of one serene island called Careneros, and just minutes away, by boat, from the main drag of bustling Bocas Town. what makes YEMANJA unique? YEMANJA's founders were born and raised in very different parts of the Caribbean - one in Jamaica and the other in Panama. After meeting in Brooklyn in 2008 they decided to bring their respective Caribbeans together, and to design a space that truly reflects the rich and enormous culture of the region. YEMANJA's mission is to change conventional ideas of Caribbean travel, and to create a space where guests and visitors, as well as locals, celebrate this diverse culture, with delicious food, music, and engagement with the local community. about the HOSTEL YEMANJA's hostel is run out of a rustic and traditional Caribbean home, along a quiet waterfront, but just across from the busy, main island of Isla Colon. YEMANJA accommodates eighteen guests - twelve inside the house and six more in bungalows. Guests have access to a kitchen, a garden, an outdoor lounge with hammocks and spectacular views, as well as a breathtaking swimming beach that is just a ten-minute walk from the hostel. The rooms will be designed and decorated in a traditional Caribbean style with folk art from around the region. Guests may want to cook and eat together at the hostel, or stroll down the sandy pathway to the watertop restaurant and bar. what about the RESTAURANT? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemanja's restaurant is a 750 square foot structure set atop crystal \nblue water, overlooking the surrounding mountainous islands. As soon as you walk in from the dock you will be greeted by our friendly, open kitchen. The dining room, which seats forty people at large, communal tables, will also serve delicious tropical drinks from the long cocktail bar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now we have a lease signed on both these spaces and are almost ready to open the hostel! But we need to raise the final $15,000 in order to finish the kitchen, dining room, and bathroom inside the restaurant. \n\nwhat can you tell me about the food? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt YEMANJA you'll eat fresh, locally caught seafood. You'll also eat produce grown on neighboring islands, or in our very own backyard! You'll get to taste our \"comida remezclada,\" traditional Caribbean dishes remixed in our kitchen. All day long we'll serve ceviche with tropical island fruits and empanadas filled with Jamaican \"jerk\" chicken. In the morning we'll make salt cod and cassava fritters, and arepas with local cheese. At night you can come try our curry-coconut stew or goat braised slowly with hot peppers. Our cocktails will be strong and delicious, and made with fresh fruits and rums from all over the Caribbean. what do i get by donating? Our dream is that all of our supporters will come visit us down in Panama! The larger your donation, the longer and fuller your reservation will be! For example, a $50 donation earns you dinner and drinks for two in our brand new restaurant. A $500 donation earns you a weeks full stay in our hostel plus dinner and drinks each night of your stay! And we're also offering a donors dinner, from a very tropical New York City restaurant, on Monday the 24th of September, where contributors of $125 or more can come sample the dishes and drinks we'll be serving in Panama. special thanks There are a lot of people who helped us with this Kickstarter page, who tried our hundreds of recipes and cocktails, and who gave us tremendous love and encouragement so far. Extra special thanks to David Felix Sutcliffe and Helene Zund for making an amazing video and graphics; Ryan Greer of Flux Productions for designing YEMANJA's lovely t-shirts; Sebastien Aubert and Michelle Lane of Kaz an Nou for their incredible support and for providing us with such a beautiful space to create and serve our dishes; Reaghan Malloy, Liam and Sophia for sharing the dream; Smooch Cafe for letting us host fundraising events; Mayra Cimet for handmaking our thank you cards; Max Bartoli and his business genius; and our top taste testers: Erin Eldridge, Ahmed Gallab, Nicola Rigoli, Jason Trammel; and to Mr Basquali ********* en español ********** ¿ Qué es YEMANJA? \n\nYemanja es un destino de viajes muy especial situado en el Caribe.  Fundado por dos mujeres provenientes del Caribe,\nes un Restaurante, Bar y Hostal en Bocas del Toro, Panamá. Nombrado en honor a\nla mística diosa del mar, YEMANJA abrirá sus puertas en Diciembre del 2012. \n ¿ Donde es Bocas del\nToro? \n\nBocas del toro es una provincia localizada en\nel noreste de la Republica de Panamá. La isla Colon, también llamada Bocas del\nToro está a solamente una hora de la frontera con Costa Rica. El área es un destino\nde viajes muy popular, cuenta con bellas playas, para surfear o para relajarse,\npaseos por la selva tropical y paseos para ver pájaros. YEMANJA está localizada\na orillas de una serena isla llamada Careneros, y solo minutos, en bote, del\npopular y rebosante centro de Bocas de Toro. ¿Qué hace a YEMANJA unica? \n\nLas fundadoras de\nYEMANJA nacieron y crecieron en distintas partes del Caribe- una en una isla y\nla otra en Centroamérica.  Juntas han\nunido sus caribes respectivos y han diseñado YEMANJA para que refleje la\ndiversidad de la región. Visitantes y huéspedes, igual que locales,  disfrutaran del ambiente de este\nverdaderamente único punto Pancaribeño. \nAcerca del HOSTAL \n\nEl hostal esta sitiado en un casa caribeña rustica y tradicional, en un\nsereno marco frente al mar y al frente del la concurrida isla principal, Isla\nColon. Acomodaremos a 18 huéspedes- doce adentro de la casa y seis en búngalos.\nLos huéspedes del hostal tendrán acceso a una cocina, un jardín y una sala al\naire libre con hamacas y vistas espectaculares. Los cuartos serán diseñados de\nla manera tradicional caribeña y con arte folklórico de toda la región.   \nAcerca del RESTAURANTE \n\nEl restaurant cuenta con 750 pies cuadrados sobre las aguas cristalinas\ndel Caribe y con vistas a las montañas de las islas circundantes. Acomodaremos\na 40 personas en mensas largas y comunales y cinco personas más en el bar. La\ncocina abierta les dará a los visitantes la oportunidad de oler y ver la comida\nmientras es preparada y contribuirá al ambiente relajado del sitio. \nEn estos momentos contamos con un contrato de arrendamiento para los dos\nsitios y ¡estamos casi listos para abrir el hostal!  Pero necesitamos solamente los últimos $10,000\npara construir la cocina, el comedor y el baño adentro del restaurante. ¿Qué me puedes decir acerca de la comida? \n\nEn Yemanja comerás mariscos frescos acabados de pescar. También comerás\nverduras cosechadas en las islas vecinas y en nuestro jardín. Probaras nuestra “comida remezclada,”  comida caribeña tradicional remezclada en\nnuestra cocina.  Haremos ceviches hechos\ncon frutas y vegetales de la isla y empanadas rellenas de pollo al estilo “jerk”\ncon cítricas ensaladas de col. Arepas hechas con quesos locales y guisados de\ncabra cocida a fuego lento en salsa de curry con coco. Nuestros cocteles serán\nfuertes y deliciosos a la vez, y hechos con frutas frescas y rones provenientes\nde todo el Caribe. \n¿Qué consigo si dono? \n\nTodo el que contribuya\ncon YEMANJA tendrá un coctel gratis en el bar. Mientras más contribuyes más\nlarga podrá ser tu reservación. ¡Y te estaremos esperando! Nuestra meta es\nabrir nuestras puertas en Diciembre de este año, ¡y cuando lo hagamos, podrás\nvenir a visitarnos!

This program teaches New Orleans inner city children to live a healthy lifestyle and to have pride in themselves. \nAbout Darryl \"DancingMan504\" Young: \nDarryl was born and raised in the 9th Ward of New Orleans. He started working with kids after Hurricane Katrina with his \"Heal To Toe\" program. He goes to schools and teaches dance and fitness. The dancing is based on local customs and traditions such as second line dancing. With fitness, he stresses the importance of breathing while exercising and doing your best. The kids learn to have pride in themselves and where they're from. \nDarryl tries to bring arts and crafts instructors with him when he can afford the expense. The kids make t-shirts and props that they wear to festivals when performing with DancingMan504. Sadly, the schools don't have much money for extra curricular programs such as this, and the local government offers no support. Almost all of the expenses come out of Darryl's pocket, and in his own words, \"The kids need me and I don't mind.\" \nDarryl also has a program called \"Brassercise\" that he teaches at various spots in New Orleans like Audubon Park. This program is for adults and helps him keep his head above water.The average price is $10-$15 per adult for a one hour class. Kids are free. His classes are almost always full--mostly with the ladies who love his energy and boyish smile. Darryl always tells his kids... \"Come to Brassercise. And you're allowed to bring your parents.\" \nJames Demaria met Darryl Young two years ago while working on location in New Orleans. They share the same passion for preserving New Orleans' culture and heritage without exploiting it and have become fast friends. Darryl regularly comes to New York to share the New Orleans culture with James Demaria Productions. Whether throwing a Second Line on the Brooklyn Bridge or the upcoming Jazz Funeral For Coney Island, they never tire in their endeavors to teach outsiders \"the New Orleans way\" in hopes of keeping it alive and respected for future generations. \nAbout James Demaria: \nJames is from New York and has lived in New Orleans twice in his life. The last time was in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina. Since that time, his work has turned from fashion and advertising to the musicians and performers of New Orleans. His film, Tremé Life, features many artists from the local music scene, including his executive producer Kermit Ruffins. \nJames is passionate about his spiritual home and fights on a daily basis to make sure her culture is not exploited . \nPlease see the link below for our Second Line Across The Brooklyn Bridge which happened on the same date last year. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch...

Each track captures a moment in time, whether for a person or a particular place. Imagine if a John Steinbeck short story had been written as a song, and this will give you a fairly good idea as to what Chicago Farmer accomplishes on his albums\"  - Honest Tune Friends, In 2013, Chicago Farmer released an album titled Backenforth, IL. With your overwhelming support, that album opened a lot of doors and I am truly grateful. I was able to tour the country performing at festivals, at venues supporting some of my all time heroes, and even headlining some of the same venues where those heroes regularly perform. Backenforth, IL rose to #33 on the Americana Charts, top #10 on several folk charts, and as I'm told from many of you spent a long time in a lot of car stereos.  I'm happy to announce that I'm ready to kick down some more doors and put something new into your ears and car stereos. Midwest Side Stories will be available this Fall (Late September) but for those who Pre-Order it here, you will receive it at your door step several weeks before the official release.  Risks and challenges “I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain.”\n-Chicago Farmer (Umbrella, Midwest Side Stories) \n\nWith your support of the last album, and your continued support at Chicago Farmer shows, I'm proud to say that I was able to pay for the studio time, engineering, mixing, mastering, and even the great musicians who laid down their talents on Midwest Side Stories. (Some of them worked for party favors and PBR, but most for cash). I'm grateful to be an Independent Artist able to do such things and couldn't do it with out your support. THANK YOU! \n\nWe put a lot of heart, soul, sweat, tears, and even some blood into making this album. While the basics are covered, we still have a large hill to climb with ordering a few thousand copies of the album, publicity, videos, radio promotion, and eventually Vinyl etc...The goal is to put Midwest Side Stories in as many ears, hands, living rooms, and car stereos as possible. We've set our goal at $20....because we love you! \n\nThink of this as a Pre-order and special incentive for your continued support. Get to know the new songs before the release shows.

    "textDescription": "Story \nHello everyone, thanks so much for coming to this page. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your consideration on this project.  Some of you have been asking about the new self produced record that has been on hold for way too long at this point.  Well, after tracking the CD back in August of 09 things were put on hold due to funding. Yes, it has been that long!! And things are still not moving along any quicker at this point. So, since this is an independent project, and many people have been asking about pre-orders ect, Kickstarter seems to be a great option. So here fans and friends can pre-order and pledge what they can with rewards involved.  \nAfter doing my first record (\"Between the Lines\") on my own, and then another for a record company, I realized that there is nothing better than owning your own CD and having total control over every aspect of the project that will ultimately be released under your name.  So I wanted to try and do the same for this record and keep it in my hands since it is all my own music, and I have already done half the work and funding. This is a project that I have been really excited about.  A band that includes some of my favorite musicians, all of whom are leading voices in jazz today.  Aaron Parks on piano. Warren Wolf on vibraphone. Matt Brewer on Bass, Ted Poor on Drums and we also tracked some with Jochen Rueckert as well.  I'm sure you guys know these names, and if you don't, check em out!  We recorded 9 of my original compositions.  There are two Quartet formats, one with piano and one with vibraphone.  And we also tracked some of the pieces in Quintet format with both chordal instruments, and there are two duo pieces with me and Aaron as well.   \nWe recorded this at Avatar Studios here in New York.  Which is my absolute favorite place to record, and such a historic space with an amazing sound that is just unmatched.  But also not cheap!!  Same engineer as Between the Lines, Anthony Ruotolo.  So far the rough mixes already sound great, so I cant wait to mix and add more things to this recording.  I plan to mix at Avatar and Master there as well.  If I go over the amount I'm aiming for, we will hopefully be able to update a couple of the songs and do another tracking session.  Then get the design done and go straight to printing.  Since I have already done half of the spending for this record, the amount I need to finish this project is $8,000.  Of course if I do better than this on here, it would help out immensely with publicity and the always inevitable and sure to come but still unknown costs that come up while putting a record together. =)  \nEveryone who can pledge $25 or more will receive a hard copy of this record.  So don't think you are just donating money here. You will get something for your money. This is the first time I try something like this, but I figure, I have nothing to loose!  I hope you can take part in it.  All my best !   \nMike Moreno \nmikemoreno.com \n Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Update - June 25, 2012 - The Final Product Revealed \n\n\n\nPlease check out the latest update to see photos of the final product \n \n\n \n\nI've known about Kickstarter for years and have always wanted to launch a project.  I'm sure many of you can relate.  After developing several other projects, I finally decided to go for it with this iPhone skin made from real apple wood. I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible.  Hence, the basic (silent) video and short description listing the main features of the iPhone skin. These iPhone skins are made from real apple wood.  Each skin is unique with its own distinct wood grain.  They are laser cut and measured precisely to fit on the back of your phone.  The camera port has plenty of clearance to allow the camera to function normally.  There is also a relief to reveal the Apple logo.  These iPhone skins are less than 1mm thick, have contoured edges, and a matte finish.  They come with an acid-free, removable adhesive, already applied to the back of the skin.  Also included is 1 sheet of laser cut high tack adhesive.  Please note that these are made for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S only. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than just a box. The packaging for these iPhone skins convert into a stand for your iPhone just by folding along the score lines.  They can be used in portrait or horizontal modes and can accommodate the cord for the charger.  They are made from chipboard, corrugated cardboard, and repulpable tape, and are 100% recyclable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunds will go toward purchasing the raw materials(such as wood and adhesives), expendable supplies(such as sandpaper and sealers), packaging material, and shipping. Why Did I Make This Product? I just thought it would be fun to have an iPhone with a skin made from real apple wood.  I searched online but could not find one, so I decided to make one myself.  There were numerous trials on paper, test cuts on cardboard, and adjustments down to 1/1000th of an inch. \n\nThe Process \nI will be making each one of these skins myself and will not be outsourcing any process.  I buy all of the raw materials and supplies and assemble them. Some of the steps in making these skins include: prepping the material, programming the laser cutter, applying the adhesive, several sanding steps, and finishing.  At this time, I have found that the best way to finish these pieces is to sand by hand and seal each one individually.  It is much more time consuming, but the end result is far superior than finishing my machine. These iPhone skins are easy to apply.  Align the camera port and the relief for the logo.  Center left to right, and top to bottom.  Gently apply even pressure.  Very little pressure is needed to adhere to your phone.  Please note that these iPhone skins are intended as aesthetic only.  Though they may prevent (or cover up) scratches, but they do not protect from damage due to water, impact, or drops.

Over the past 18 years, I have apprenticed with local artists and traveled the world to study this art form at its origins. Supporting my family solely with my art has always been a dream of mine, but the initial investment has been a major obstacle. However, recently I was given the opportunity of a lifetime to purchase four major pieces of equipment that would help me make the transition into a full-time glass artist. I am seeking $10,000 to purchase this equipment, which also covers installation and delivery. Your support would mean the world to me and my family. It would not only allow me to live my dream, but it would also serve as a means to expose my son to creative practices and let him see his father in action doing something I love. In return for your support, I am offering some great rewards.

To see the rest of the collection visit: http://www.theyarnslayer.com/flutter-flow-preorder/ \n\nYour support in this effort will allow me to pay my tech\neditor, my graphic design helper, and print a limited run of books. To thank\nyou for supporting this effort, I've made a special list of rewards for you\nincluding copies of the book, special knitting tutoring sessions, knitting\nkits, and even custom knitted hats and sweaters. \n\n \n\n\nLace Highway & Jannette's Slouch Kits Available \n \n\n \n\n\nAbout Me Conventional wisdom dictates knitting is relaxing and\nmindless. Unfortunately, I’ve never been good at relaxing and mindless. As a\nchild, knitting gave my antsy hands something to do. As I got older, my antsy\nhands and restless brain searched for harder and harder patterns to conquer.\nFinally, nothing would do except to invent new patterns myself. \n\nThese days, the creation of a simple pattern isn’t quite\nenough to tame my restlessness. It demands that my designs push the envelope,\noften beginning with the thought, “Is this possible?” With that, a quest to\nslay the next dragon begins! \n\nYarn is my favorite tool in this quest, but also my most\ngifted adversary. Like my sigil, the ferret, I continually search in familiar\ncorners to find something new and surprising to challenge me. Also like the\nferret, my fingers display a joyous dance of war when I discover it. \n\nMy background includes an M.S. in Textile Engineering from\nPhiladelphia University. My designs have appeared in publications including\nInterweave Knits, Knitscene, knit.wear, Creative Knitting, Vogue Knitting, and\nKnitter’s Magazine. My winning knit fabric design was also distributed\nnationally through Urban Outfitters. \n\nThrough my work as a knitting instructor and yarn guru at\nPrairie Yarns in Fargo, ND, I enjoy teaching people how to slay their own\ndragons.

It will take a significant amount of work but it will also be fun.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKickstarter? \nWhy am I here on Kickstarter when I have already created 3 successful courses without it? \n\nThis course is quite a bit larger in scope than my other courses. To help with the larger scope I’ve hired Toby Dixon as a contract pixel artist. As you can see from the screenshots, his art is amazing! I’ve been paying him using my business savings but I’m running low. I will be using the funds donated via Kickstarter to continue paying Toby as he creates the different worlds and animates the many monsters. \n\nAlso, a Kickstarter allows me to create a more flexible pricing structure before the course is placed on Udemy (see pledge tiers).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks \nThank you so much for your interest in my course!\nPlease consider pledging your support! \n \n\n Risks and challenges There are many challenges that might arise during the course creation process. Having created 3 successful courses, I've already encountered many of them. I'm confident in my ability to overcome any challenges that might come up.

It is made by empassioned human beings who are on a mission to reveal what might otherwise stay hidden; who intend to sit and stare at truths and experiences that often just vanish. Secret Behavior  is full of feelings, flesh and other human stuff. It celebrates beauty, ugliness, desire, mystery and solitude, and recognizes our common and uncommon mental states, physical forms and sexual experiences.  Secret Behavior ’s second issue is nearly complete and scheduled to launch during the NY Art Book Fair at MoMA/PS1 Queens in September. The issue will consist of 180 pages devoted to the intimacy, beauty and dysfunction of family.

    "textDescription": "Story Project by Michale Graves and Hydraulic Entertainment \n \n\n“This is a true labor of love” \nThe origin of the idea: \nIn November of 2012 Michale launched his first Kickstarter project – the Rock Folk album “Vagabond”. Vagabond was released on February 26th of 2013 and has been incredibly well received by Michale’s loyal fans as well as new fans that have had the opportunity to hear the album. Michale supported the album with the Spring “Vagabond” tour that kicked off at the historic Stanhope House on March 22nd – the tour will run through May 25th of this year.  \n One of the pledge levels created for that Kickstarter project was a limited number of in-home acoustic performances - Michale has been playing acoustically throughout his career but never in an intimate of a setting as in-home. The first of these events occurred at the residence of longtime fans and friends JoeMisfit and MaggieMisfit,  “home of the JoeMisfit Collection”. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring that incredibly touching private performance, Michale began each song with a story of its origin and commentary about the influences that impacted each song. With 15 people within arm’s reach, Michale in the living room and his business partner Mark, sitting on the center hallway steps - the idea for this album – “Vagabond Acoustic” was born.  \n“It was one of the most memorable musical experiences that we have ever had – and the ability to share it with family and friends was simply AMAZING”. - JoeMisfit \n\"The intention of this project is to recreate that experience on one compelling and personal album” \nTelling the Story of Vagabond Acoustic \nMichale has selected 8 songs from the “Vagabond” album to perform on “Vagabond Acoustic”. These songs lend themselves incredibly well to the acoustic format and each is prefaced with an audio commentary that highlights the origin and history of each song. Songs included on the album will be: \n     “Revolution By Candlelight” \n     “Burn Baby Burn”  \n     “Oh, Please Why”  \n     “I Can Feel Heaven”  \n     “Train to the End of the World”  \n     “The Best Of Me”  \n     “Vagabond”  \n     “Break Me Out”  Intro to “Best of Me” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Narration intro and beginning of “Break Me Out”\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSong sample for “Revolution By Candle Light” \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtremely Limited Edition “Vagabond Acoustic” CD set to be released 8/15/13  \n\"Vagabond Acoustic” is a very limited edition project with only 400 total CD’s being produced for this campaign.  Michale has created several pledge levels for this project ranging from a $10 thank you to a $1,000 public performance where you are the producer. The heart of this project is the “Vagabond Acoustic” CD. There will only be 300 Hand numbered CD’s at the $20 level and Michale is offering something special for his friends and fans at the $40 pledge level - an ULTRA limited numbered of autographed and number “Vagabond” CD’s. THERE WILL ONLY BE 100 SIGNED AND NUMBERED “Vagabond Acoustic” CD’s.  \n\n\nPledge $175 or more for one of these \n \n\n \n\n\nAnd being true to the origin of the original “Vagabond” project there are 3 levels of acoustic performances being offered: an in-home event for up to 10 people for $500 plus travel, an in-home performance for up to 25 people for $750 plus travel and a public performance that you promote for $1,000. But there will only be a total of 15 acoustic performances offered with this project – set to be performed during August and early September of 2013. \nWhy Kickstarter?  \n \nThis is Michale’s third Kickstarter project and he feels that this is the ideal platform to pre-sell, promote and interact with his fans. We consistently receive feedback and requests to continue to use Kickstarter so we are very excited about this project.  \nHydraulic Entertainment  \nHydraulic Entertainment, headed by CEO Mark Allen Stuart, is a creator, producer and promoter of eclectic film, video, music and entertainment properties. Accessing the finest talent in the business, Hydraulic Entertainment is a vertically integrated company that is comprised of artist/business people throughout the organization.  \nAbout Michale Graves  \nMichale entered the music scene in 1995 in a huge way – as lead singer for The Misfits . Michale rapidly shifted the band’s music from the Horror Punk style that it originated in 1977 into an Anthem Rock vibe that the band is most recognized for throughout the world. Enjoying US and world-wide acclaim Michale was named the “Number One Vocalist” in Japan in 1999. After a successful run with the band, Michale separated from The Misfits in 2001, and he counts that time as a gift that he will always cherish with love and respect, for the band and all of the fans that experienced the electrifying in concert musical experiences the band created.  \nAfter the Misfits, Michale formed several bands including Graves where he recorded the “Web of Dharma” album in 2001, Gotham Road “Seasons of the Witch” album in 2003 and his current band, Michale Graves - where he released several albums including “Punk Rock is Dead” in 2005, “Return To Earth” and “Illusions” in 2007, a short film called “The Blackness and The Forest” and a live acoustic record called Illusions Live/Viretta Park in 2008.  \nWith each phase in his career Michale has evolved his voice and the musical experiences that he creates. At the center of his music is the consistent tour of venues in the US and throughout the world. Performing for, entertaining and interacting with fans has always been the driving factor for Michale as a performer. That consistent drive has resulting in over 500 in-person performances over the last 5 years.  \nIn November of 2012 Michale utilized Kickstarter for the first time in creating the “Vagabond” project which was successfully released on 2/26/13 and was followed by the Spring 2013 “Vagabond” tour that took Michale to 45 venues across the United States. Just prior to departing for tour Michale recorded his first Monster Rock album in many years titled “Lost Skeleton Returns” – and the album has a street release date of 6/14/13.  \nA Note from Michale  \n“When I write all of my music I first compose it in acoustic form. The opportunity to create a unique and intimate experience with this album is so compelling and so original, that I had to make this happen. I hope you enjoy the “in-home performance” feel of “Vagabond Acoustic”.   \n ~ Michale \n Risks and challenges The “Vagabond” full band project has been incredibly well received. The Spring “Vagabond” tour with 45 tour stops has helped in promoting the “Vagabond” voice. We anticipate that “Vagabond Acoustic” will have a very strong following:\n\nR/C #1 – An acoustic version of the “Vagabond” album doesn’t have market demand. During the spring tour Michale carved out 4 songs and performed them acoustically. This prove to be the highlight of each performance.\n\nR/C #2 – An album that includes acoustic songs with audio background commentary will not be accepted by the fan base. Michale has been performing acoustically for 10 years and each of those performance involved telling the background story of each song.\n\nR/C #3 – The goal isn’t met and the CD isn’t produced. We have set the goal at a very low level to insure that the project will be completed and fans rewarded with a diverse assortment of pledge levels.\n\nR/C #4 – The concept of the album is interesting but how can Michale’s fans have an in person experience themselves? There is an assortment of pledge levels that include in-home performances by Michale. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story THE REASON FOR THE PROJECT  Over the years,  gun violence and crime across the entire United States has dramatically increased. Whether it occurs on the street, in homes, or even in schools there is always someone staring down the barrel of a gun and taking lives. This issue is very two sided and leaves much controversy in the offices of politicians and the eyes of society. There are many in this country who enjoy shooting firearms recreationally, while others stray away from the deadly potential of these weapons.  This is the concept and controversy in which I choose to decipher in my undergraduate capstone exhibition. It is a very serious issue in today’s society and I want to bring the intensity to life through the visual arts in a neutral way that not only appeals to viewers but educates them as well. This exhibition will emulate my advanced knowledge of sculpture and art education through a series of six pieces using the assemblage process. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT  I will be creating a representation of the American Flag out of nearly 15,000 spent brass bullet shells. The size of the flag will be approximately 4 feet high by 7.6 feet wide.  Each of the shells will be mounted onto a hard wood backdrop using a two part epoxy and then hung for the viewers eye to see. From a distance it will look like a typical american flag, however as the viewer steps closer they will realize that it is made solely from spent shells. For this project I will be using thee different size shells to asset in depicting the values of color in the flag. I will not be painting the shells, rather the orientation of each shell will create each value as seen in the small model below.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By placing the charge end up as seen in the star, it creates a white value. On the other hand, by placing the hollow end up, the residue of gun powder creates a dark value such as a blue or red.  TYPES OF SHELLS USED For the stars I will be using nearly 1,550 .22mm shells. These shells are most commonly shot by criminals. Below you will find an image of what the .22mm looks like.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The second shell size I will be using is the 9mm which is also commonly shot by criminals. This shell will be used to make up the blue surrounding the stars. There will be approximately 5,000 used.  Finally, I will be using the 45 ACP shell to make up the stripes in the flag. These are commonly shot by task forces and federal agencies. There will be approximately 8,500 of these used. Below is an image of the 45 ACP, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS WORK \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROCESS  There are two different methods that I have considered for constructing this massive piece. The first is very simple yet very expensive. Firstly, I plan on purchasing a sheet of 3/4\" thick hardwood and then sectioning it off into three pieces. Then, I plan to input a computer designed file that lays out the organization of each hole into a CNC router. This will then scan the file and drill each of the 15,000 holes into the wood accordingly. After the piece has been drilled  I will epoxy each and every shell into the coordinating hole. Finally, I will affix each section together and then mount the piece on my designated presentation wall.  The second process is much more tedious. If the cost of running the CNC is too expensive I plan on creating wood frames for the size of each section. Then I will staple a polyurethane screen to the bottom of each portion. Next, I will have to place each shell individually on the screen. Once all are placed I will lift each section and lay it onto its coordinating background piece of wood which will be lathered in epoxy. I will let each section dry, then remove the frames and affix the sections together.   MY GOAL! Essentially, my goal in\ncreating this work is to show people my ability to create a work of art that is\nboth representational and educational. It is to leave the viewer with their own\ninterpretation as to what they value and believe in this tragic time of gun\nviolence and crime.  This piece will provide the community\nwith a positive aesthetic experience. Additionally, it will develop an experience that\nallows the community to support their personal beliefs or even develop a\nstandpoint of their own on this issue.  WITH YOUR HELP AND GENEROSITY I can potentially bring awareness and visual\nunderstanding of this controversial issue. Which, in part, may or may not\nassist in persuading those above to further evaluate this topic.I want to not only appeal to those who are\ndisgusted by this issue but to those who also value recreational gun use. I do\nnot plan to take a standpoint; I simply present both sides of the issue and\neducate the viewer on the intensity through the visual arts. Risks and challenges There are a few issues with this large scale political project that still arise even outside of the funding. The main issue is the over all recognition of the piece and its pathway into the real world.\n\nNot only will you backing help my work be completed but it will also bring recognition and awareness to the work and the topic making it much more feasible to launch into the real world. \n\nIn order to over come this struggle to socialize this piece, I plan to reach out to EACH AND EVERY BACKER and thank them for they help and understand how my work has impacted them. \n\nI am confident that my strong work ethic and passion for this project will guide every obstacle out of way and pursue the piece into societal recognition.

He is a rising talent in the Los Angeles art scene and getting an artist like him means that this book has the potential for great things.You can check out his style on his website: http://illustrateded.com/ .  I am raising money to pay my talented artist, copy write my material and print my book. Every dollar I raise will go straight to funding my dream of having people read what I have to say. I have worked tirelessly to make sure that every investor in my project will get far more than their money's worth and get to own my book proudly knowing that you helped fund one of your most treasured books. Together we can bring my dream into a reality. Thank you for believing in me. Risks and challenges Challenges naturally arise when creating any art. It can be difficult to find the right illustrator to represent your writing and it can be a challenge to layout the book one page at a time and customize every inch of the final product. However, I am lucky to have found the right artist who believes in this project enough that he was able to assist me in the whole design process. So as I launch, most of my obstacles are already overcome. The book you will receive is already laid out and is set to print once I reach my goal.

    "textDescription": "Story Making short films is not an easy task, nor is it cheap. We have an incredibly talented & hard working team of filmmakers, production designers, special effects & makeup artists all working together to ensure that this script is brought to life on screen the way it was meant to be. But without funding, things can prove pretty difficult.  Eddie Holecko, our special effects & makeup artist, has the task of creating living, breathing monsters on screen. You can imagine that special makeup and prosthetics are not cheap, but if you want to do it right then there is only one way. Heath Daniel, Carolyn Shannon, and an extensive art department are all working together to renovate my house into a brothel from the 1990s that will be present for over 75% of the film. We really want this brothel to feel as genuine and believable as possible, as if you can smell the cigarette smoke and the dirty shag carpets. This however requires many props, wallpaper, lamps, etc that all add up in costs. Jeremy Peele, our cinematographer, is in charge of camera and lighting for the film. SCAD does not have all of the heavy duty lights and specific gel colors that are needed for the film to have the correct & intended look that we are going for, so part of our funding will be delegated to this department as well. Lastly, everybody has to eat right? Feeding a cast & crew of over 20 people is not simple, but is so necessary. Being on set, working the long hours, creating films, it's what we're all here for, but we all need energy to do it. Why invest in this project? Our team is committed to making a film that will both entertain & engage you, but also a film with substance that will hopefully linger with you after viewing. Making films is not easy or cheap, especially good ones. Please help us turn this script into the living, breathing, vision it was meant to be. Risks and challenges This is a short film involving many special effects & hard work, and like I had said before, short films are not easy to make. But I had also mentioned that our team is committed. Whatever we may encounter, it will be conquered. We set out to make this film and that is exactly what we are going to do until it is the final product that we have all been striving for from the very beginning.

    "textDescription": "Story THE STORY: A young writer is given a strict last-minute deadline to finish a script he only recently started working on. The deadline gives him just one day to finish the whole thing. To make matters worse, he finds himself unable to ignore the nagging memory of his ex-girlfriend-- who, in a constant attempt to give him suggestions, further distracts him in the process. In the end, he is forced to make the choice between following the direction of his art, or of his heart. PROJECT ORIGINS AND GOALS: Although I have primarily worked on documentaries, this short narrative will be my debut film. The project is important to me because the story's protagonist deals with a very relatable human problem-- one that I'd like to address and offer a solution to. The project arose from the idea of trying desperately to escape painful thoughts/memories that continue to nudge their way back into the forefronts of our consciousnesses. Such memories could be of a lost love, a friend, a relative, even a pet. Whatever it is, we all know that no matter how hard we try to ignore them, there are times when it's near impossible to push these thoughts from our heads. Dwelling on them can interfere with our day-to-day lives so much that I feel it's important to remind ourselves how to move on, as well as what we need to do to put ourselves back on the right track. I chose to examine the subject matter in the form of a lighthearted romantic comedy because although it's about a rather stressful predicament, there is really a lot of humor to be found in the situation as well, and I think there's value in recognizing that. Once the film has been finished, we plan on entering it into as many film festivals as we can in order to attain the broadest possible coverage. It's a passion project that I have been writing for a very long time (say, 14 complete drafts of the story), and I have been dying to find the right like-minded people capable of helping me get it off the ground. Well, that time has finally arrived. CURRENT PROGRESS: With the film being guided by the hard-working and very talented members of Primitive Productions-- Producer Chris Riley, Direct of Photography Jerome Stolly, and Unit Production Manager David Estrada-- the project is really taking off, and we are picking up speed. Our supporting actor Talib Ali has already signed on to the project, and we will be holding casting sessions within the month. August is being dedicated to securing locations and shooting our test footage to ensure a smooth production come time for the week-long shoot. As of right now, the shooting schedule is set for the first week of October. That being said, we are still heavily in the midst of pre-production: finalizing the script, creating storyboards, hiring actors, scouting for locations, etc. Although we still have loads of work to do, the enormous energy and creative drive couldn't be greater, and everyone is very excited to make the film happen! HOW YOU CAN HELP: Yes, we are moving forward, but the film still needs your help! Essentially, all of the budget comes from the support of those interested in seeing the project adapted to the screen, and we would be more than tremendously grateful for any donations to help fund the project. Every contribution will be spent towards production: Permit fees, location fees, equipment rentals, props, transportation, as well as hiring the best actors we can find to bring the roles to life. Anything helps, and you would be given my absolute most heartfelt thanks! However, if you're unable to donate but would still like to contribute, you can spread the word and inform everyone that the project exists by sending them to this web page, which in itself would be extremely helpful! FINALLY: Thank you SO much for your support! I can't describe how much I appreciate you taking the time to check out this project! I sincerely appreciate all of your help and I can't wait for you to see the finished product! Let's make a movie!

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction for new players\n Defenders of the Realm (DOTR) was first published in 2010 and has sold thousands of copies worldwide since then.   Created by the wonderfully fertile and imaginative mind of designer Richard Launius, and enhanced by the genius of artist Larry Elmore, DOTR has developed an ever-increasingly larger and loyal fan base.  This Kickstarter campaign is primarily geared to that fan base and generally assumes that Backers will be familiar with the base game of DOTR.  However, Eagle Games recognizes and appreciates that some Backers will not be familiar with DOTR and for them we offer this link so that you can check out the world of Defenders of the Realm and perhaps purchase the base game as an add-on to this Kickstarter project: More Information Here \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat will I get if I back this project? 1) You will have your choice of getting from one to four of the expansions of 25 unpainted Minion figures.  Each Minion Expansion will include 5 Elite Minions and 20 Base minions. The Elite Minions are pictured in the video above and the sketches below, along with sketches of the Base minions and  a description of each race. Keep in mind that these are the artist sketches of the figures you will obtain.  The molds have not yet been created as this is the primary purpose of raising funds via Kickstarter for this project.  The molds and resultant figures will be created from these sketches and will thus highly resemble them.  The material used will be PVC resin, the same as that used for the DOTR Hero Expansions (also available as an add-on in this campaign).  The factory that produces the Minion Expansions will be the same as that used to produce the Hero Expansions.  The 25 Minions (per expansion) that you will receive will each be in one solid color (i.e. the Orcs will be green, the Undead black, the Dragonkin blue, and the Demons red). 2) You have the opportunity to purchase Additional DOTR items --some never produced before , including:    a) The QUEST deck -- 84 standard-sized (3.5\" by 2.5\") cards, including 23 from the original game, 9 from the Dragon Expansion, and 52 that are brand new!     b) The MAGIC GATES pack of five 3D plastic magic gates to replace the 2D tokens used in the original game!  3) You will get any and all stretch goals we reach for free if you have pledged at least $45 (of any sort) to this campaign.  Later on (post Kickstarter) they will only be available for an extra cost as an expansion. 4) You may purchase the base game of DOTR ; or the Hero Packs ; the standalone Defenders of the Realm: Battlefields Game; or even painted versions of these Minion Packs; as add-ons to the basic Minion Pack campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrc Minions: The Orc Minions are made up of large numbers of savage\nwarriors and swift Wolf Riders that swarm over the Realm. Although weaker in\ncombat than the Demons, Undead, or Dragon Armies, their vast numbers can lead\nto a quick Dark Lord victory if not kept in check. The elite Wolf Riders roam\nthe realm making the movement of the Realm Troops and Heroes difficult,\ndisrupting Hero Quests and attack plans. The Orc Minions Pack provides the\nplayers with 20 Orc Warriors and 5 Wolf Riders, along with the Minion Cards\ndescribing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndead Minions: The Undead Minions are the most\nterrifying troops of the Dark Lord’s Army. The most numerous of the Undead\nMinions are the ferocious Skeleton Warriors raised from the dead by powerful\nnecromancers, terrifying the inhabitants of the Realm as they march unceasingly\ntoward Monarch City. Riding in support of the Undead Skeletons are terrifying\nNightmares, heartless creatures raised from the underworld, riding flaming\nstallions as they terrorize the villages and cities throughout the Realm. The\nUndead Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Skeleton Warriors and 5\nNightmares, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be\nused in playing Defenders of the Realm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemon Minions : The Demon Minions are foul and corrupt\ncreatures primarily made up of grotesque Gluttons; bloated creatures that feed\noff the land, destroying all life and consuming the mana from the Realm as they\ntrundle toward Monarch City. In combat, the Gluttons attack using their long\nspike-like claws to skewer their enemies and pull them into their gigantic\nrazor-toothed mouths, feeding upon their enemies the way they feed upon the Realm.\nDeadlier than the Gluttons, the Blood Demons charge into battle wielding a\nflaming sword that not only burns the body, but corrupts the soul as well. The\nDemon Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Gluttons and 5 Blood Demons,\nalong with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in\nplaying Defenders of the Realm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDragonkin Minions : The Dragonkin Minions are made up\nprimarily of the brutal Dragonkin themselves. These ancient creatures are half-man/half- dragon, with hard-scaled skin that deflects arrows and blades in combat-- making\nthem the toughest warriors of the Dark Lord’s very formidable army.  Controlling\nthe Dragon-Kin are the Dragon Mages, powerful wizards casting ancient Dragon\nSpells to protect the armies of the Dark Lord. The Dragonkin Minions Pack provides\nthe players with 20 Dragonkin Minions and 5 Dragon Mages, along with the\nMinion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders\nof the Realm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get FREE Stretch Goals--when we reach these Funding Levels they are Unlocked and FREE to you if you have pledged at least $45 in total pledges (of any sort) for this campaign! \n \n\n \n$28,000 - Unlocked ALTERNATE MINION CARDS - These cards feature different, harder abilities for the base game Demons and Dragonkin. \n\n\n\n\n\n$31,000 Goal - Unlocked ALTERNATE MINION CARDS - These cards feature different, harder abilities for the base game Orcs and Undead. \n\n\n\n\n\n$34,000 Goal - Unlocked Demon and Dragonkin Darkness Spreads Monarch City raid cards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$37,000 Goal - Unlocked Orc and Undead Darkness Spreads Monarch City raid cards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$40,000 Goal - Unlocked Inn Raid and Move any General Darkness spreads cards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50,000 Goal - Unlocked Legendary Deck - an ALL-NEW Deck of cards to add new abilities to the heroes!  This is a 16-card pack. \n\n\n\n\n\n$55,000 Goal - Unlocked Global Effects Deck - This is a 9-card pack reprinting the Global Effects Cards inside the out of print Dragon Expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n$60,000 Goal - Unlocked Alternate Orc General - This Goal is for a new Orc General miniature and General Board!  NOTE the BGG contest running now to name this General! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$65,000 Goal -- Unlocked Two New Darkness Spreads cards: Realm in Flames.

We realize that some of you think that Eagle Games, being a well-established and reliable company, and that Richard Launius, being a well-respected and accomplished designer, should not necessarily need to raise money on Kickstarter for such a project.  However, there are many risks and challenges in the games publishing business, and we want to take on these challenges sensibly.  There are numerous companies that cannot handle these challenges and there have been some spectacular failures recently. Eagle Games has been around for more than a decade (and we intend to be around for a good deal longer).  To us it makes no sense to spend the many thousands of dollars required to produce molds and miniature figures unless there is clearly demand for this product.  So that is the primary reason why we are running this Kickstarter campaign--to establish that sufficient demand is there to warrant this production.  To make it worth your while to help us out, we want to make sure that you realize: 1) When the Kickstarter campaign is over and the product is available, we expect the MSRP for each Minion Pack to be $30.  You are able, via this KS campaign, to get each mini-pack for as little as $20 each. 2) When this Kickstarter campaign is over and the product produced, the Stretch Goals that you are getting for free will be sold separately as an expansion.  We do not have a firm MSRP in mind yet for these but it will likely be $10 or more.  Also, this expansion may not be available for an additional 6 months or so to the mass market, so think of this as a \"Kickstarter Exclusive Release\" to Backers only. 3) You have the opportunity to buy Add-Ons for much better than MSRP prices by buying them now via this KS Project. 4) You get FREE shipping if you are in the USA.  If you are in Canada or another international location, you get the \"American subsidy\" for shipping plus the best rates that we can arrange for you. We really appreciate your support via Kickstarter, it helps us a great deal with decision-making and covering the big production costs involved in producing molds and miniatures. Thanks--Richard Launius and the Eagle Games team \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DOTR Minion Expansions are relatively small. One, by itself, will fit into a USPS Small Flat Rate box tightly--and that's a good thing. That costs $6 in the US. We pay this and send those to you (if you are in the US) for \"free\". Canada In Canada, we plan to send all the Canadian Backers' orders to one single person or company that would agree to having us send all copies to them and then out to individuals. Assuming this works we still need to pay for shipping all the games to Canada, and customs, and the costs of internal-to-Canada postage and materials, as well as some labor to actually send these out. So please add $16 (for the first pack) for shipping if you are a Backer in Canada. And add $3 for each additional pack in the same order delivered in Canada. So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Canada. Germany and other EU countries Unfortunately the small size of the Minions Pack does not help us in the EU -- where the rates for us to send anything from .1kg to 5kgs are all the same. That is great for bigger and heavier games but not for the DOTR Minions.  So we have arranged to send the DOTR Minions and related products  internal to Germany to an individual in Germany who will send them out, and that allows us to tell German backers that they can add $16 to their pledge for the first game sent to an address in Germany and $3 for each additional game sent to that same address.  So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Germany. The Netherlands is also an exception because our warehouse is located there.  So shipping the four pack of minions within the NL costs only $22. The EU other than Germany  If we can find someone in France, Italy, Spain, and other countries that multiple backers might live in then we need to know that. Otherwise we will use our warehouse in The Netherlands to send out all EU orders. And these orders will cost $22 added to each pledge for shipping for one pack and an additional $3 for each additional game. So that is $31 for shipping a four pack to a country in the EU. Australia The rates to Australia are the same as those to Canada because of a new relationship we have with a distributor in Australia. So add $16 for the first game and another $3 for each additional game. So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Australia. Elsewhere in the World Finally, if you live somewhere other than Canada, Germany, the EU, or Australia, please add $30 for shipping the first game to you and $5 for each additional game to the same address. So that is $45 to ship a four pack anywhere else in the world.  We realize that shipping is expensive and we do not like paying this amount any more than any of you do either.   We do subsidize shipping expenses, and we certainly do not profit from them at all. Thanks for your understanding. Risks and challenges Eagle Games has participated in 20+ successful Kickstarter projects completed in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and all of our projects have shipped out either in the same month we originally projected or within 30 days thereafter. Even so, there are always unpredictable events which can occur that might delay our projects. We will do our best to avoid them, but there is always the risk that the project might be delayed. Shipping can be a particularly difficult challenge when it involves destinations outside the US (and sometimes even within the US as well). We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us. We have been producing board games for over 10 years and we have a good reputation for the quality of our productions because we visit and choose our Chinese partners/factories carefully. However, mistakes happen occasionally that we cannot control--such as missing or defective components. When they do, our customer service department will work with you to take care of production problems that might arise. Please contact us with regard to any such issues within 90 days of receiving your copy of the game. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story About this project It came to me first as a vivid dream, and has manifested into a 3-year project I have developed a deep passion for. My novel, “Guardians of Salus,” is a tale of perseverance and overcoming your past; of learning to fight for the great good. It is representative of everything I stand for and I have been granted the opportunity to have it published. I am reaching out to you today, to help me gain the funds I need to make my dream of becoming a published author come true. I have provided an excerpt from “Guardians of Salus” and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Excerpt from Guardians of Salus: “Dead!”\n\tThe word echoed around my head on that day, a long time ago in my twentieth year. It was the same word that woke me up every morning. The same word that took me into my nightmares at night. The voice never changed either. It was the same voice as my father, the day he told me that my mother was dead. My eyes flew open as I sighed, looking towards my clock on the nightstand. It was still blackout time, and I couldn’t hear the whir of electricity running through the room. I reached for my clock and tapped the light button, illuminating the face; 6:00am. Perfect, my favorite time of day.   I swung out of bed and walked towards the window; gently pulled back the thick dark curtain and looked outside. Morning light was starting to penetrate the horizon. I got dressed in the dark, pulling on sweats, a t-shirt, and a sweatshirt. Grabbing my tattered old running shoes, I carefully made my way downstairs, trying not to make any noise so as not to wake up Dad.   Once outside I threw up my hood, and breathing deeply let the fresh air fill my lungs. I stuck my wireless earphones in my ears, turned them on, and let the music wash over me. My feet started pounding the pavement as I took off.\n\tI loved running. Feeling my feet hit the ground, the wind sailing past me.  My Mom used to tell me that I was running before I was even walking. She said one day I just stood up and took off. \n\tI ran as fast as I could away from my house, a place I liked to leave behind. It was big and splendid, and was steeped in family history. But to me it was a burden, a standard I had to live up to. So I left it behind to enter into the neighborhoods that weren’t as grand, but felt more real.  I looked at the row of identical houses stretching in front of me. All made from wood, with stairs leading right up to the door from the sidewalk. Narrow fronts, two stories tall, and a narrow driveway to the right side of the structure.   The monotony of my county is still a vivid picture in my mind. I used to run this route every day, soaking in the moments I had there, for I knew it was a limited time. The sameness was a comfort to me. It spoke of peace, of tranquility. It reminded me of my own insignificance. Thinking about others stopped me from being stuck in my own head, a dangerous place to stay.   As I passed the wooden village I emerged into the Town Square, the next reminder to me of the world I could have lived, the place I wanted to leave behind. The Town Square was literally a square, with a large fountain in the middle. Shops on each corner, and at the tip of the square stood the massive Justice Building, with its white marble pillars, neat rows of windows, and majestic façade. It spanned about 100 yards wide, and even farther back. Behind it hid the place that I longed to run from, the place I never wanted to be: The Governor’s mansion; my home.   I lived in Salus, a refuge city divided into four counties; Potentia, Ager, Industria, and Contego. I lived in what was called Central, the governing district of Potentia, really the hub of the city. I was the son of the Deputy Governor, a man with a life sentence.  Salus was all I’d ever known. It was beautiful and full of life. But even the most beautiful places can have the darkest secrets. I think I felt it, even then, the darkness that resided in Salus, that would soon take over everything we thought we knew. \n Risks and challenges There is a possibility that I will not make the funding for this project, but rest assured your money will not be taken from you if that is the case. As well I'm still unsure as of yet when publication will be, but as soon as my editor starts her work I will have a better idea and let you know of any changes or obstacles.

Since its premiere at the 2012 Twin Cities Horror Festival, we have performed the show for audiences in New York, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Kansas City and Edmonton, Canada and have been overwhelmed by the response from patrons and critics alike. One of our goals with The Legend of White Woman Creek is to record an album of the thirteen song cycle and we are excited to announce that we have scheduled studio space in New York City to begin the process.

    "descriptionMediaNumber": 0,
    "textLength": 7668,
    "textDescription": "Story Hi, my name is Stephanie Mathias, and I want to thank you for checking out my Kickstarter Page! I am a pop singer-songwriter, and this project will raise funds for my first ever professionally recorded CD - an EP titled \"Fragile.\" Here is the long version of my story and project: Purpose: I have always had two main goals in my life: 1. Help people and 2. Make music. My childhood dream for accomplishing both goals was to be a singer-songwriter. When I was just 3 years old, I was so fascinated by singing and the piano that my mom, who was an amazing classical pianist, began to teach me how to express my emotions through music. Since birth I have battled with anxiety, but when I am writing songs I address my conflicts and calm my fears. I also feel unique and special when my music comforts or inspires someone else! So songwriting has always been a part of me. Until recently, this was just something I have always loved, and I have been fulfilling my missions of helping people and making music as a wife, a nanny, a teacher, a professional violist, a devoted Mormon, and now as a mother. I feel so blessed by these opportunities to grow as a person and as a musician! My personal experiences inspired my music, and even though I was not a professional singer-songwriter yet, I had my friends and family encouraging my singing and songwriting abilities. After my daughter Natalie was born I felt inspired to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter. Motherhood opened me up to my most vulnerable self and the widest range of my emotions. I suffered from post-partum depression and even more anxiety than what I was already dealing with. I also felt grief stronger than ever from the death of my own mom, which was 10 years ago this month. Above all I felt this new, deep and intense love for my daughter that made me feel infinitely inadequate. Music has been one of my ways of processing it all and working through it. I would also sing and play for Natalie, and I told myself, \"I don't want my daughter to ask me why I never pursued my dream or developed my talent.\" So for the first time I shared my original song \"Fragile\" with the world through YouTube and Facebook. I was nervous about putting my heart out there for everyone to see, but I was received so well by all of you! And my songs began to help me heal too. So I kept writing and sharing more homemade videos, started performing in local open mics, and got some recording experience, even between hectic babysitting jobs and the whirlwind of new Motherhood. Goal: Now, 3 years later, I am ready to take my music to a professional level by making my first radio-ready CD! This EP (which is a 5-song CD) will allow me to be taken seriously as an artist so that I can sell my best songs online, submit them to songwriting competitions, and perform at bigger live music venues. And if I am able to start earning a little money with my music, I can write, record and share even more songs, which is what I ultimately love to do. I want all of you to have my CD because I am making it with you in mind! The 5 songs I have chosen for this EP are inspired by what I have learned in the past 3 years about love, trust and hope that helped me overcome my fears. I am so grateful for what I have been able to overcome and as I see many others going through similar things, I want to reach out to them and let them know that they are not alone. I have faith that through our struggles we can still love ourselves and others. We can reach out and let God, loved ones, and even professionals lift us up. We can let our fears sink in for a minute so we can work them out because in the end, there is always hope that we can grow through it. Plan: I have found an expert recording artist to bring my vision to life. Marco Delmar from Recording Arts Studio is an incredible producer and musician and also an artist development specialist who knows how to steer my career into the directions that I want to go. It is so meaningful to have someone on my team who cares about me as a person AND as an artist and also has the wealth of knowledge and abilities to help me accomplish my goals! I also have touring drummer Nik Hughes playing on these songs and it is an honor to have his talent showcased on my EP! I have a wonderful job with a schedule that allows me to invest my time and money in this project. So we have already begun recording the EP and we finished recording the EP's lead single \"Fragile\" which you will hear a preview of in the Kickstarter video! But now I need your help to pay for the rest of the EP. $3000 from you will allow me to: \nCover the rest of the recording fees  \nPay Kickstarter.com and distribute rewards  \nPay for mixing and mastering  \nMake album art and CD copies  \nCopyright my songs  \nSell my music online  \nDonations beyond that will go towards expanding on the EP, creating music videos, distributing more rewards, promoting my music, and/or recording future songs. Every dollar helps! \n Rewards: I appreciate every single dollar and minute that you invest in my project!  So you each will be rewarded handsomely and personally thanked by me!  By donating $5 you can get your hands on the digital download of the EP before its release date! Other rewards for $10, $20 or $30 include signed CDs, PDF sheet music, violin lessons, and exclusive T-shirts and posters designed by my ridiculously talented husband. Backers who donate $50 or more will receive a \"sponsor package\" with all the goodies and also be named as a sponsor on my CD cover! Other great rewards on the higher donation level include a personal concert, a song commission, and even a charity performance in your name!  So Please Click The Green Button and Back My Project! I am so excited to finally make my childhood dream a reality. I know that there are many more challenges to come but I will always have my faith, my music, and your love and support to help me through it. I have discovered that some of the most beautiful things come from the hardest things. My EP \"Fragile\" will show you my fears and pain, but also my faith, strength and love. THANK YOU for joining my cause and allowing me to share these songs with you! Love Always, Stephanie Risks and challenges There are always challenges when you do something for the first time. First of all, my nerves! But I have overcome so much and am allowing myself to stretch even more, and it is empowering. This Kickstarter is a prime example of taking risks and putting my heart on the line, and I have been able to accomplish it! \n\nI also have a busy schedule, so I have also taken the time to investigate the turnover for each part of the process and am planning accordingly. I gave myself plenty of room in the timing in case there are any setbacks with my schedule or production.\n\nI have an amazing support team that will allow me to finish the recording on time. Marco Delmar is professional and confident and we have already recorded a song to prove it. My family and friends have already begun helping me by watching Natalie so I can record. Ricky is helping me with the visual designing (because I am not a visual person, and he is!) And even my daughter \"helps\" me practice my songs by singing and dancing along! \n\nI take pride in being a responsible person (and I have many nanny references to prove it! ;) But seriously, this is something I am putting my heart and soul into and I am excited for every single part of the process. You will be more than happy with your pledge rewards and with the final product! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Data is transferred in both directions with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) so it is easy to troubleshoot. We call this feature Esquilo Remote Procedure Call or E-RPC for short. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut E-RPC doesn't just stop with JavaScript in your web browser, you can also integrate it with standalone applications using a REST-like interface.  Here is an example E-RPC call using curl: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You also can call E-RPC with an HTTP POST: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr you can call it from your favorite programming or scripting language such as this Python example:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-RPC makes it easy to integrate embedded functionality into virtually any connected application. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heart of Esquilo is a Freescale Kinetis ARM Cortex-M4F processor running at 120MHz. This processor is packed full of features including a 1MB flash, 256K SRAM, hardware floating-point, hardware encryption, 16- bit ADC's, a number of serial buses, and the list goes on and on. The 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi interface is built around a Broadcom chipset. There are two options for powering your Esquilo, a 2.1mm barrel jack with a 6 to 17V DC supply or with 5V via the micro-USB jack. There are a large number of hardware features so take a look below for a longer list. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120 MHz ARM Cortex-M4F \n1MB flash, 256KB SRAM, 8KB EEPROM \n802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi\nArduino UNO R3 shields \nHardware cryptography engine \nHardware floating point \n6-17V DC power input (or 5V via USB) \nMicro-USB (for bootloader and USB CDC console) \nMicro-SD with FAT32 support (up to 32 GB) \n46 digital I/Os (5V tolerant inputs) \nSerial buses: 2 x SPI, 2 x I2C, 5 x UART, 1 x CAN \n18 PWM outputs \nQuadrature digital input \n16 analog inputs with 16-bit resolution (4 differential) \nAnalog output with 12-bit resolution \nPrecision voltage reference \nAnalog comparator \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsquilo would not have been possible without all of the great open source software available in the community. It seems only natural for us to give back too. That's why our hardware design is completely open source. Want to see the schematics or build a board for yourself? It's all available on our web site. Much of our software is also open source and available on GitHub. Want to create your own cloud portal? No problem. Download our secure tunnel daemon and run it on your own server.  Want to add a new Squirrel library?  You can do that too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs big fans of the maker movement, we have created a wide variety of DIY projects with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and a slew other development platforms.  A simple development board like Arduino lets you quickly jump in and start creating.  But to add Wi-Fi, you've got to buy an Arduino and Linux mash-up board or add an expensive Wi-Fi shield and spend lots of effort integrating software just to provide basic networking. \n\n\nEsquilo has Arduino-like simplicity \n \n\n \n\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Linux-based boards like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone let you leverage a vast array of open source networking software but integrating them together still requires a lot of work and know-how. You've got to install a Wi-Fi dongle, load drivers, write configuration scripts, and install software packages just to get a usable Wi-Fi networking stack going. \n\n\nEsquilo has Linux-like networking functionality \n \n\n \n\n\nThere is also a new crop of IoT development platforms that make it much easier to get a Wi-Fi networking application going but these new platforms share a common flaw in that they require you to use cloud infrastructure.  In essence, they are \"handcuffed\" to the cloud.  Esquilo gives you the freedom to choose to use the cloud or not.  Since everything you need is built-in, Esquilo is perfectly happy running in an isolated network. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe think the community needs a development platform that bridges the gap between simple boards like Arduino and complex Linux-based systems to enable developers to create rich, network-enabled applications with ease without the cloud dependencies.  That’s why we created Esquilo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing drives home an idea like a good example.  Let's go through the weather station demonstration in the video in detail to show you how easy it is to develop a connected application with Esquilo. \n\n\n\n\nWeather demo in a Safari browser \n \n\n \n\n\nWe are using a SparkFun weather shield that uses two I2C sensors, the MPL3115A2 for pressure, and the HTU21D-F for humidity and temperature.  For the embedded app, we write a getWeather() function to read each parameter from the sensors over the I2C bus and a little code to initialize the sensors and the hardware. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we write some JavaScript and HTML boilerplate for the web page.  The JavaScript calls the getWeather() function using our E-RPC technology in the embedded app once per second and updates the HTML.  Combine this with a style sheet and you have a 100% code complete connected weather station. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas Meter The gas meter demo shows you how to create a smart WiFi gas meter that you can use to graph your natural gas or propane usage as well as monitoring your bill and greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote LCD The LCD demo shows remote control of a Newhaven Serial RGB LCD module using the NetIO mobile control app. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprinkler Controller The sprinkler controller demo shows how to run an autonomous task on your Esquilo that functions independently from the web interface. It uses the Squirrel Timer class to run asynchronous timers in the background to control the sprinkler zones. The web interface is used to both configure the schedule for the zones and to immediately control their operation.  The demo uses a Seeed Studio relay shield to control the sprinkler zones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsquilo 3D The Esquilo 3D demo shows a three dimensional Esquilo logo that moves in real time to match the orientation of the Esquilo board. The demo uses a Freescale IMU shield with accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope. The logo is rendered on the browser using WebGL and the three.js JavaScript 3D library. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop and bottom views of the ProtoShell \n \n\n \n\n\nWe also developed a prototyping shell - our name for an Arduino shield with our 40 pin expansion header - to allow you to add your own custom hardware on top of Esquilo.  The middle of the ProtoShell has a 12 x 12 grid for through hole components surrounded by power and ground bus bars.  There is also an area with a variety of footprints for adding SMT components, each with their own through hole pads to jumper to.  There are footprints for SOIC, SOP, SOT363, SOT23, 0603/0402, and 1206/0804.  Also, each pin coming from the Esquilo has a dedicated through hole pad so you can stack more shields or shells on top. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know someone who might be interested in easily creating Internet-connected things, then please help us spread the word.  The bigger the Kickstarter campaign, the more cool things we can add to Esquilo. Thanks for checking us out! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp us get to $25K, and we will add an MQTT client with an easy-to-use Squirrel interface that also supports MQTT over SSL/TLS. This will make it super easy to integrate Esquilo into any MQTT network and communicate with other IoT devices.\n\n  Help us get to $50K, and we will include a MicroSD card with every reward we ship to store programs, data, web content, or whatever using Esquilo's MicroSD slot.\n  Help us get to $75K, and we add an Esquilo Nest cloud drive and integrate it into the Esquilo operating system. You can read and write files stored in the cloud drive from your Squirrel programs, run Squirrel programs in the cloud from the Esquilo IDE, and share files between your Esquilos.\n  Help us get to $100K, and we will include an Esquilo ProtoShell with every reward. For those rewards that already include them, then you'll get an extra ProtoShell. Esquilo is a great prototyping tool and having a flexible prototyping area for extra hardware sure comes in handy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Esquilo project started in June of 2014.  By September, we had hardware prototypes working with a full WiFi stack.  In November, we had the Squirrel virtual machine executing code with a fully functional IDE.  We spent December through February implementing the secure cloud access and Esquilo Nest and entered beta testing in March.  Our first production run is under way and we are set to be able to ship the first round of rewards by June of 2015. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsquilo prototype, revision A0, and revision A1 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a great relationship with our contract manufacturer who is based very near us in Austin, Texas.  We have already made a pilot run of Esquilos on their production line which are currently in the hands of our beta testers.  Our first production for our Kickstarter is already in progress. \n\n\nPCB Panel for Production \n \n\n \n\n\nWe are big believers in testing products to assure quality from the design phase all of the way through to production.  We developed a sophisticated test fixture for manufacturing that performs both electrical and functional tests to assure quality and make our manufacturing process as efficient as possible.  We based our test fixture on a custom interface board connected to a Raspberry Pi running open source JTAG and testing software. \n\n\nProduction Test Fixture \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Shumate started his hardware hacking career in his early teenage years by ripping apart the family's Tandy 1000 PC to see how it worked. He went on to study hardware more seriously by earning a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas.  Scott was a lead architect at industry bellwether Cisco Systems for 8 years.  He has also shown his entrepreneurial talent by founding successful start-ups including Linux home automation pioneer uControl. In his spare time, he enjoys contributing to open source with projects such as writing BOSSA, the ARM flash programmer in the Arduino IDE, the ShumaTech digital readouts, and many others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Jackson has been coding since his dad brought home a Sinclair ZX80 way back in 1980. He holds a BSEE from the University of Texas and has performed architecture and team lead roles for the industry leader Cisco Systems, as well as a handful of startups. He founded a successful consulting firm, where he and his partners provided full-stack hardware, firmware, and software development services for a wide range of companies and products. He spends exactly the right amount of his spare time (and money) hacking together home automation projects. Risks and challenges Given our extensive professional experience and the fact that we have a fully working system already in beta test, we are very confident that the technical risks to this project are minimal. Production risks are low since we have an established relationship with a US-based contract manufacturer that has already built pilot units for the beta test and our production run is already in progress. Fulfillment risks are minimal since we have handled large volume shipments for previous projects and know how to do this efficiently.\n\nThe main uncertainty is concerning delivery dates if there turns out to be substantial interest in Esquilo that exceeds our first production run. We could exhaust available parts inventories for manufacturing a second run but we will mitigate this by staging the delivery of the rewards as availability allows.

    "textDescription": "Story Random tables are a popular part of roleplaying games whether it is coming up with a random monster during a forest trek, naming an inn, or coming up with quirks for a new NPC the players meet.  What's not fun is finding all the tables you want, carrying around a notebook of random tables, updating those tables and manually doing the rolling.  Enter Random Table Wiki! With the Random Table Wiki all of those tables get stored in a wiki for easy creating & updating and you can then roll on those tables using any browser! The RandomTableWiki is already up and running! You can see the wiki here . Backers at the You Can't Wait level and higher can start using the wiki right now!Anyone can make rolls on the random tables in the wiki right now! You make your random table requests at this website .  Use RandomTableWiki everywhere : On your computer, on your Mac, on your tablet, or on your smartphone. Anywhere you have an internet connection, you'll be able to use RandomTableWiki.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate on Tables:  Any table you create in the wiki will be usable by other people and any table someone else creates will be usable by you. My hope is that the wiki will grow to hold a large collection of quality random tables.  Easy Table Sharing:  With one wiki holding all of the tables, you won't have to hunt down and install other users' tables and you won't have to do anything special to share your tables with others. RandomTableWiki  will be the one place for all your random table gaming needs.  Easy Table Creation : Creating a table is as simple as making a list of results.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerful Table Creation : With the ability for one table's result to call another table (and for that table's result to call another table, and so on and so on), you can make powerful random tables utilizing many, many tables for one result.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the basic prototype is up & running. The RandomTableWiki definitely still needs some polish before it's ready for everyone to start to using.  Really though, the Kickstarter is to see how much demand there is for this idea. If the community supports it and is interested, then there are several stretch goals I have in mind.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone, backer or not, can start using the random tables that exist in the wiki right now. Look at the wiki to see what tables are available and roll all you want on the request website .  Everyone who pledges at the I Can't Wait level or higher, will gain access to the RandomTableWiki right now (well, give me a day or so to add you in). You'll get access to the Google group to discuss things and edit permission to the wiki so you can start creating and modifying tables.  Backers who support at the higher levels will help the RandomTableWiki achieve the stretch goals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more the project funds, the more features I can add! The first stretch goal is below: $1000 - Member Area, Buttons & Bookmarks While typing in your request works, it's not the quickest and easiest way to get a random table result. If this stretch goal is acheived, we'll add a members area to the Random Table Wiki. In the member's area, you'll be able to create buttons for your favorite tables and then just click the button to make those rolls without having to type anything in. You'll also be able to bookmark a button so that you can easily do a roll that way.  Risks and challenges Proof of concept is already complete as shown in the video. It just needs to be cleaned up, hopefully with stretch goals, and some more functions added to it. \n\nThe author has developed multiple, data-driven websites as programmer for Paladin Programming and has delivered on a previous Kickstarter as the author of DM's Familiar.

My dad\nsaved me and my 3 siblings, yet my memories of childhood, especially of my\nmother, are very few. From the ages of 9-15, I watched and re-watched our home\nmovies of her. Slowly, my mother became the image of a mother, a depiction of\nfemininity in all its grace and beauty. Last winter I learned that there was a\nstock of film of my mother which I hadn’t seen – 8mm footage of her as a child.\nIn the deep colour and flickering movement of these films, for just a few\nshimmering seconds, I finally saw my mom. Almost everyone has lost someone they loved deeply. It is often very difficult to understand and express our feelings about such a painful experience. We believe that this film is really important, not just for us, but for anyone who understands loss. This film will explore the subject in an alternative way to what we are used to seeing on television and in Hollywood films. We are going to use our bodies, experimental sound, poetry and observational footage to present an unconventional look at childhood memory, adult identity and our understandings of femininity. \n\nABOUT US \n\nI have been\nwith my partner Caitlin for seven years now, and we have been working together\nas artists for over 4 years. ‘Mother, I am going’ marks a point at which our\nvideo-performance work meets our documentary filmmaking . It is our most\nimportant work to date, and this vision we have, of making a cross-genre film, is something that we have been excited about for a long time. \n“The\nvideo installation ‘Clinging’ which they presented in June 2011 was well\nconceived and very powerful. It was made with a very slender budget, which in\nno way diminished its effect as a strong and provocative piece of work.” Stuart Cameron, Director of Crescent\nArts\n\n \n\nOur collaborative partnership began at the Arts\nUniversity at Bournemouth, where we graduated in 2012 with first class honors\nin BA Photography. We have exhibited in galleries nationally and\ninternationally. Our 44 minute graduation film, In Search of Silent\nLandscapes , premiered at the 26th Leeds International Film Festival in\nNovember 2012, becoming a 'festival favorite', with two sell-out screenings. \n“A very interesting film ... the\nstart on black with voice over, the brilliant cinematography, the pace - a vision of an extraordinarily driven woman.”  Peter Symes , BBC Producer \n\nIn 2012,\nCaitlin was identified as an emerging talent by the film producer, Colin Pons (‘The\nAcid House’, ‘Hush’). After a national\ncall, Caitlin was selected to take part in ‘FilmWorks ’,\na Creative England professional development scheme for up and coming film\ndirectors and producers. During the three month intensive programme, Caitlin\nreceived invaluable one-to-one mentoring from industry professionals, and\ndeveloped the skills and vision needed to bring to life an ambitious project\nlike ‘Mother, I am going’. \n\n\nFilmWorks final networking event at Watershed, Bristol \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe support of FilmWorks, the success of ‘In Search of\nSilent Landscapes ’, and my revelations in seeing my mom as a child, has given\nus the courage and conviction that now is the right time to embark on this most\nintimate work. \n\nWHERE ARE WE\nNOW? \n\nIn the last two months we were invited to show our work\nin two exhibitions in Berlin. We performed live together for the first time\n(very nerve-wracking), allowing us to gather some beautiful footage to use in ‘Mother, I am going’. \n\n\nOur performance at AGORA, Berlin \n \n\n \n\n We are working with two magical poems by the\nBengali writer, Rabindranth Tagore , and have recorded some initial voice-over\nwith the celebrated Canadian artist Margaret Dragu . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe aim to\ncomplete the film in Spring 2014. The finished work will be exhibited as a\nmulti-screen gallery installation, and will also be edited as a single-channel\nfestival film. \n\nWe plan to\nsubmit the film to various film and art festivals. Encounters Short Film\nFestival in Bristol are excited about this type of cross-genre film, and\nthrough FilmWorks, we have made a great connection with the festival programmer\nwho is really positive about the project, and the possibility of premiering the\nfilm at Encounters 2014. We are also constantly networking and seeking out\nspaces, such as AGORA \nin Berlin and SITE Gallery in Sheffield, to show the multi-screen installation\nnationally and internationally. We will utilise our growing network of contacts to make sure that the finished work can be seen by as many people as possible… that’s\nwhat it is all about after all! \n\nTHE JOURNEY BEGINS... \n\nWe would\nlove you to join us on this journey… in fact, we need you to join us on this\njourney. This Kickstarter Campaign is our first venture into crowd funding, and\nwe feel that it is the best chance we have to raise the funds needed to produce\nthis film in the most artistically uncompromising way possible. \n\nFinding and\ntraveling to the locations that are essential to the work, both visually and\nconceptually will take time and money. In an abandoned village in Bulgaria we\nplan to shoot a performance using rubble and personal items, toys and photographs,\ngathered from the derelict houses of former inhabitants. We will seek out the\nvast and other-worldly landscapes of Eastern Europe as a metaphor for the\nlandscape of memory, and a backdrop for the film’s exploration of loss. We also\nplan to work with a musician to create a unique, experimental musical score for\nthe film. \n\nFrom now\nuntil the completion of the project in spring 2014, we will completely devote\nour time and passion to our film, living in the converted bus which is our home\nand studio, and putting every penny into production and post-production. \n\n\nFinal book layout for 'In Search of Silent Landscapes' \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is\nhard to describe what this film means to us, and how grateful we are for every\nsingle donation. Each pledge is a voice behind us; someone else who believes in\nthe importance of this work, and our ability to make it fantastic. Please join\nus on this exciting journey! Thank you. THANK YOU REWARDS We think we have come up with some pretty special ways to say thank you, and to bring you along on the journey with us. We are so happy you believe in us, get ready to receive one sweet cyber kiss! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe literally can't wait to get our bodies into action and create an on-the-spot, unique, 10 second performance video to e-mail over to you within 24 hours of your pledge. Please don't forget to send us your e-mail address or you will have to wait until August for any kisses, hugs or 10 second performances :-( Here is a little example of what to look forward to... \nThe original moon drawings come from an on-going work called MANY MOONS. Our Many Moon project is an integral part of our research for the multi-screen installation and is a focused attempt at recognising the sacred in the everyday, of documenting the now. The project consists of a series of drawings of the moon with accurate co-ordinates and collection number written on the paper. Each drawing accompanies a 10-30 second video clip, which is presented on our website. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an experimental project like ‘Mother, I am going’, storyboards are an important part of the idea development, and they also work as a means of communication between us…director to cinematographer. These storyboard images are more stylistic and detailed drawings inspired by our earlier rough storyboard sketches. Each drawing shows our vision for a scene in ‘Mother, I am going’. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are just a few of the rewards, if you have any questions, or would like to know more about the rewards, we would love to hear from you. Enjoy! STAY UPDATED If you like what you see here on Kickstarter and on our website , please tell your friends about this project. Lets join our networks and spread the word. Many thanks! Join our mailing list , then follow us on Facebook , Twitter , and of course, here, for more updates! HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS When\n you donate to Mother, I am going via Kickstarter, we ONLY get the \ndonation IF the campaign reaches its £3,000 goal. If the \ncampaign does not reach its goal, then we receive £0, and you donate \n£0! Whatever happens, you will still get the unique 10 second performance video ;-) ☑ Your payment is as easy as buying a DVD from Amazon.com. (Here is a video  on how to pledge.) ☑ Your pledge amount is NOT displayed publicly. ☑ You can change your pledge at any time. (Here's a video  on how to modify your pledge.) ☑ You can pledge from anywhere in the world! Risks and challenges In Britain, much traditional art remains restrictive and inward looking, as cinema becomes increasingly focused on big budget entertainment. We have a strong wish to engage new audiences in art and offer an alternative perspective on filmmaking. \n\nIt can often be a challenge for cross-genre films like ours to be seen by a wider audience outside of the art gallery. By producing a film that has high production values and beautiful, high quality sound, music and post-production, we will have the best chance of getting the film seen at festivals all over the world, and also getting the film streamed online. \n\nHaving produced and exhibited several multi-screen video installations, and made a 44 minute documentary film over the course of two years, we understand that the creative process is not always easy. We know that there will be days when we question the core of what it is we are doing, but we also understand deeply that these low points are necessary in creating a really good, sincere film. \n\nThe story at the heart of ‘Mother, I am going’ could not be more important to us, which means that the energy and courage needed to overcome any struggle, exists in abundance. Have no fear… this project could not mean more to us! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Did you miss the Fritz Kickstarter? You can buy Fritz at www.xyzbot.com/store.php Fritz is a robotic head, with moving eyes and jaw, but also (in the advanced version available) eyelids, eyebrows, lips and moving neck.  Fritz is great fun, but also a great educational tool.   Update: Stretch goal added. $42K and we will...  1) Include a sonar sensor with every $70 and higher reward. And we will include software to allow Fritz to run in standalone mode, no PC.  So he will react when the sonar sensor triggers. For halloween, you could set up Fritz to start talking when people walk in front of him.\n\n 2) Tweet reader - We will add software to have Fritz read your Tweets to you as they come in. You just connect to Twitter using the Fritz app, and he'll read it to you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFritz says thanks for helping him to reach the $35K stretch goal in this video.  This is a white acrylic Fritz, and really needs the sun, so thanks a lot for helping us hit $35K. This video was made with an actual Fritz, using the Fritz app. \nHere is an MDF Fritz video a week ago, asking for help on the stretch goal. \nWith our $35K funding we have added \"behaviors\" for Fritz, taking input from things like a webcam or sensors and react to them.  First behavior: He will be able to detect a face using your existing webcam and then \"wake up\" and greet you with \"Good morning\".   \nOr to tell you the local temperature, or the temperature in Rome or wherever you'd rather be. So, the app will include ability to get input from sensors, and to read headline from Yahoo news and say it to you.  Over time, we will add other scripted behaviors that you can download. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho can use Fritz? For kids, Fritz is a great project to start with robotics and animatronics.  And once he is built, they can continue to learn and have fun by customizing him, adding features, making a movie starring Fritz, etc.  Fritz can even be a way to study the psychology of human expression and emotion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those that just want to have fun with a robot head, Fritz is ready for duty.  You can use Fritz to build a display for Halloween.  Fritz can talk to Trick-or-treaters, or scare them into dropping those pillowcases and collect the loot for yourself. For more experienced users, Fritz is a good way to break into human emotion mimicry robotics.  The computer software and the Arduino firmware will be open source and can be modified. Basic and Advanced Models Fritz is offered in two versions:  Basic and Advanced.  Basic Fritz has moveable eyes, and jaw.  The Basic model is less expensive and easier to build.  Advanced Fritz has greater range of expression, adding eyelids, eyebrows, lips and moveable neck. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not a robotics expert.  Will I be able to build and use Fritz? Fritz was designed to be easy to assemble.  No robotics experience required.  Fritz is recommended for ages 12 and above. Tools needed are a small Phillips head screwdriver, needle-nose pliers, and glue.  We recommend hot glue or Gorilla Glue.  Budget about 2 hours to build Basic Fritz and 3 hours for Advanced Fritz. Using Fritz is easy once he is assembled.  The control application helps you to get him set up, then you just start having fun, clicking on features and playing around.  You can connect a joystick and control him that way rather than using the app and a mouse and keyboard.  The open source software makes it easy to update and modify if you want to, but no Arduino, or electronics, or programming experience is needed. What about the control app?   XYZbot has created a Windows application that allows you to control Fritz with your mouse, or keystrokes, or even a joystick or game controller.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n The app has a picture of Fritz's face. When you move your mouse over his face, green control dots will appear. For example, click on an eye and you will see red arrows appear (see photo above) that show which direction the eye can be moved. You just click and drag to move that part. Or you can click on a pre-generated \"expression\" like Happy, Sad, Disappointed, etc.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fritz face in the app will show that expression and robot Fritz will move his features at the same time.  You can record a sequence of actions and play them back. WIth his Text to Speech feature , you can type in text and Fritz will \"speak\", moving his jaw and lips in sync.\n\nYou can also use a joystick for a \"live\" feel. If you want to use Fritz as a puppet or ventriloquist dummy, this is probably the best option since you can can get very complex behavior very quickly. More about Behaviors and RoboRealm What if Fritz could \"see\" you sit at your desk in the morning and say hello and tell you the temperature outside, or a news headline, or insult you if you like to start the day that way.  Our stretch goal for $35,000 will make this possible.  We will include 2 behaviors called \"Webcam Detect and Greet\", and \"Tell me temperature\".  Over time we will add more behaviors which you can download, like apps for you smart phone. This is done using the program RoboRealm which will be bundled with Fritz kits IF WE HIT $35K .  RoboRealm will give YOU the ability to script your own behaviors like have Fritz read headlines from your favorite news feed, or stock quotes.  You will be able to write scripts yourself, or download from our site and have them just run using the Fritz app without ever opening RoboRealm or any other program.  For those that are technologically adventurous, RoboRealm is a powerful program for easily and quickly bringing machine vision to your robotics project.  RoboRealm is $49.95 at normal price, but if you back Fritz at $70 and above, you get a copy for no additional cost to you. IF WE HIT $35K , so please forward and tweet this project page link and help us get the word out. \nHow does this compare to other robot products? There are a few products similar to Fritz on the market now.  We are convinced that Fritz gives the most function for the price.  The biggest value that Fritz brings is the control software, which has a picture of Fritz's face that moves with Fritz's actual robotic parts.  Other control software use a slider bar that is labeled \"jaw\" or \"left eye\" which is less intuitive than simply dragging a part on a simulated face.  The table below shows how we compare to other products along with price. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead some press about Fritz  Click below to see articles published about Fritz \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFritz goes snazzy - Acrylic in colors now offered We have had many requests for an acrylic (plastic) with color option, so we have added rewards for acrylic Fritz kits.  A quick sample of what acrylic parts look like below.  Note that all parts will be acrylic in the kit, not just the faceplate.  We offer Fritz in blue, white, red, green,  and clear acrylic.  Stay tuned for more colors as we confirm availability.  You will specify color at the end of the project by our survey.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some sample acrylic units built up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour de Fritz - Video of Fritz's Design Below is a video that shows the inner workings of Fritz.  See how the eyes and eyelids work.  It's like an anatomy lesson but without the blood and other messy stuff. \n\nOpen Source We made Fritz to be an affordable and accessible human feature mimicking robot project, not just a cool toy.  Fritz will be an open source project.  If we are funded, we will publish all the design files, both hardware and software, so you can build one yourself if you have access to a laser cutter and/or a 3D printer, and have some computer savvy.   In the long term, we want Fritz to evolve and become more sophisticated, not just through the efforts of XYZbot, but from hobbyists and professionals all over the world.  We all see humanoid robots in the movies,  walking around and interacting with humans, but a lot of work has to be done to move the technology to that level.  Fritz is a great way to facilitate this.  Even if you decide to not pledge for a Fritz robot, you can consider backing the project to help develop this technology. \nWhat are funds used for? Fritz has custom parts that have to be manufactured specifically for this product.  We have to have tools made to manufacture these parts.  A big piece of our project goal is taken up by these tooling and setup fees.  We also have to buy parts in bulk to get the lowest cost.  And finally, don't forget that Kickstarter and Amazon Payments take about 10% of the funds raised.  No complaints from us.  We love Kickstarter, but not every backer realizes that. No Worries of Robot World Domination T-shirt Do you like the idea of Fritz but you are afraid of him rebelling and dominating the world?  Then get this T shirt to fend off such worries.  You can get behind robotics in technical education, get a great t shirt and sleep soundly at night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark For those that like the idea of an open source robot head project, but don't want to actually buy one, you can help out by backing us at lower levels.  Back at $15 level and get a laser cut FritzMark; a bookmark with a distinctive Fritz head to stick out of your book and keep an eye on you.  The bookmark is laser cut and engraved from recycled card stock.  Below are pictures of the bookmark with the message \"Fritz Lives\", but we're open to suggestions on what the final bookmark should say. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of Fritz, the prototypes We started working on Fritz in summer of 2012.  Over 6 months, and 20 major revisions later, we are ready to bring to market. Here is a photo showing the mechanical design evolution of Fritz from Neanderthal to RoboHead Sapien. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info?   The video tells the story in brief. If you'd like to see more photos and information, visit our web page at www.xyzbot.com Risks and challenges Kickstarter is a great platform for promoting and funding projects. But by now we have all seen some projects that just were not ready to be put on Kickstarter. When projects fail to deliver, we think it is most often because the project creator was not ready to make the project in bulk. He or she may have made one or two in their workspace, or garage or even kitchen. But then when their idea is a hit, they find that making hundreds or even thousands of their terrific idea is beyond their abilities.\n\nThe risks then for any project are:\n Design is too immature. It is still in prototyping stage\n AND / OR\n Design works great, but cannot be manufactured in bulk\n\nWhat have we done to control these risks?\n\nMaturity of design: XYZbot has spent over 6 months developing Fritz and we are ready to manufacture. Fritz has evolved over time through more than 20 versions, each time improving features and fixing design problems. During development we have constructed Fritz in his various manifestations over 30 times, so we have worked out the design and changed things that made assembly difficult. We have donated some Fritz kits to local schools and had them construct and operate Fritz, and we learned lessons from that and fixed problems there too. \n\nBulk manufacturing: Can Fritz be made by the hundreds or thousands (or gulp, millions?): XYZbot has worked with manufacturing facilities early on to be sure that all of his parts can be manufactured reliably and in quantity. XYZbot is staffed by engineers with years of experience in designing projects that can be manufactured, rather than just built one at a time in the garage. (We do have a garage though, by the way). In addition, XYZbot's engineer Kerwin Lumpkins has created and delivered a successful Kickstarter project, The Desktop Ballista. He made over 600 units, and delivered them across the globe on schedule.\n\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/694850905/the-desktop-ballista-shoot-toothpicks-into-the-anc?ref=live\n\nSo what are the risks for Fritz? We can manufacture up to 3000 Fritzes (is that how you spell plural Fritz?) without difficulty in the time frame that we advertise. We do that by making them all locally (in Denver area). If we get more than that number of orders, it will take longer to deliver. We have planned for this contingency by getting quotes from multiple manufacturers, allowing us to increase production numbers if necessary. We can handle up to 10,000 Fritz orders in this way. We think it is unlikely, but if we do get more orders than that, it will simply take more time to deliver. The first 3K would ship on schedule, and additional units would take another month for each 10K units. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

As the Burning Manc Festival was forced to relocate to Sound Control and be taken on by NOIZ Promotions, we have been left in a position that means we are unable to continue with the event unless we sell tickets via an 'all-or-nothing' crowdfunding campaign, which will end on Friday the 25th of November at 11pm, this allows time for the site to process the pledges and release the funds (if target met). We have set a minimum of £1,800, which will allow us to go ahead with a scaled-down event featuring most of the advertised bill, but for us to be able to continue with our headliners, Melechesh, we need more. To help us reach this target, we have offered rewards that allow entry to other future NOIZ events, and also some bands have offered to reduce/waiver their fees to to help make this happen.This is all being run on a not-for-profit basis, we intend to reach the target that allows us to run the show with the full bill solely in order to continue with this date. If you pledge and the final lineup (at the end of the campaign) isn't one you want to have purchased a ticket for, you will be refunded, no questions asked, or you can swap it for entry to any two NOIZ events in 2017. As NOIZ, we have successfully pulled off several replacement shows, including co-hosting a last minute all-dayer in the aftermath of the Temples Festival cancellation this year. We are confident that this lineup has enough weight to merit the ticket price, though we understand this format is largely untested and rather controversial. However, as stated, our sole intention is to put the bands on a stage, and if we go past covering costs then we will use any profit towards putting on a free extreme metal show in Manchester.

    "textDescription": "Story Pick Specifications : \n \nFor Those Concerned with Strings Safety : Aluminum is a very soft metal. The picks have been tested with hevy abuse on nylon strings, flat wound strings and wound strings. No problem at all! Those who cannot trust can take a simple yet unnecessary step for even safer pick on any strings : with a simple kitchen knife or any knife, start to “ peel “ the pick edges off in the same way like potatoes are peeled off : towards the thumb. Make sure you do not cut yourselves. This way, you will make the pick edges duller. You can dull them as much as you want. You can also dull them with a metal file or, even, with a nail file. The blades of the pick may become rough after you dull with a file. Thus, you are advised to smoothen them up either with a knife as described or with sand paper gradually from as low grid number as you wish to 600 or higher. Please, note : I have managed to cut a flat wound with a steel pick but never with an aluminum pick and I have been playing with these picks ever since I started to make them. \n \nDescription : 3mm ( 1 / 8 “ ) Aluminum, Vertically Sharp ( from top to bottom ) Playing Edges \n \nDimensions : 1 “ ; 1” ; 1 /8 “ ( 2.5cm ; 2.5cm ; 3mm ) \n \nWeight : 2g ( 2 grams ), approximately 1 / 16th of an ounce. SUPER LIGHT. \n \nHorizontal Angle : 30 degrees \n \nPlaying area : 0.2 to 0.75cm ( Depends on the version : Sharp picks work best with low playing area which gives a sharper vertical angle thus faster playing. ) \n \nFeatures : Bump in the middle to provide a possibility for the vertical angle ( in some rounded versions ) ; vertically and horizontally flat ( except the vertical bump which is smoothened ), angled \n \nPerformance : The large horizontal and vertical angles, combined with the slickness of Aluminum give a possibility for fast solo playing. Aluminum is a soft metal and will not cut even nylon strings. Picks perform well and safe on flat wounds. OK on wound strings. \n \nGrip : The pick has a good grip anyways and no other provisions have been made since most people prefer flat picks to avoid discomfort. Because Aluminum is soft, anyone who wants can make grip points just with the edge of a kitchen knife, drill, file or, the easiest and the best, with a pair of vice grips or pliers. The best way to grip a pick, however, is to use this sticky rubber which the banks use to stick the credit cards to the piece of paper. Rubber or other non permanent glue can do just as fine as well as blue tack. \n \nSafety and Environment : Aluminum is a safe element which is neutral and does not react with other elements, just as gold, silver, copper and platinum. Does not rust as well. \n \nRe Shape Ability : Anyone who wants can re shape Aluminum with a file or, even, a knife. However, I think, this is the best shape in the class. \n \nOther : PURE ALUMINUM : no anodisation, no chemical, no electrolytic, no any treatment. Two half holes for extra grip in some versions. Treatment with bicarbonate soda ( baking soda ) may be added for grip but not recommended. Playing tip and blades are polished. Slick and soft. Light. Tone : more like plastic than steel yet as fast as steel. Picks “ adjust “ to the player : the more one plays the better they get : they get slightly polished with playing. No maintenance required. Simple sand paper sanding can be performed should the player desires and is not necessary. The same applies for custom filing : can be done with a simple, inexpensive metal file. Aluminum is very soft thus very easy to customise unlike steel. Polishing with 600 and 1500 sand paper would give best results. For heavily deformed ( impossible under normal use ), filing with a metal file and sanding with approximately : 100, 150, 220, 400, 600 and 1500 can give best results although so many grid increments are not necessary. Yet sand paper is inexpensive and largely available. Steel wool and synthetic steel wool with a grid of 0000 can be used for fine polishing. Strong real wool would give the best results. Do NOT be afraid : none of this is necessary unless the purchaser so desires. \n \nCondition : Brand New : Hand crafted in Canada. \n \nDelivery : Shipping paid by the purchaser. Canada Post have the lowest price. Self addressed and self stamped envelope is necessary. Standard stamp may cover the price. Non registered mail is a risk of the purchaser. \n \nFEEDBACK : \n \nNote : The emails of the people who provided the feedbacks are available upon request to those interested. \n \nJ. J., Ottawa : \n \nHello,\n \nThanks for the picks. I really like them. I like a thick pick, and I noticed a big difference in volume and tone. Much crisper. I really noticed this when I went back for a sound test with the plastic one I normally use. Thanks. \n \nNeil, Ottawa : \n \nI've tried them only on the nylon strings and I'm surprised that the thick aluminum has a similar effect as the 1 mm plastic one I had. More of a jazzy tone. All in all you did a good job of smoothing out the edges. \n \nThanks Steven. You really know what you are doing.\n \nNeil \n \nConnor, Ottawa :\n \nVerbally : \n \nI have played these a lot as well as I have given some to friends and colleagues to try and we all like them. These are very fast picks and the tone is very loud. They are very good and a new product which will sell for sure in the future. \n \nArthur, Ottawa :\n \nVerbally : \n \nThese picks are excellent. The first versions were very big. Although there are big picks sold in North America and they are standard, most people in North America prefer the standard ones which are approximately 1 “ ; 1 “ and different width. \n \nI have played these picks and I have liked them. The tonal qualities are excellent. I have given these to guitar players and they have all come with an excellent feedback. \n \nI prefer oval picks and not sharp with a bit of a bump in the middle as well as some grip. \n \nThe problem is : people do not know them hence you should give them for free first, so people can see their qualities. \n \nThe market is very tough on all metal picks but Aluminum is the right material! \n \nMichael, Ottawa : \n \nVerbally : \n \nThese are excellent picks. I am sure people would purchase them. \n \nCassey and Jim, Ottawa : \n \nVia Text : \n \nThese are excellent picks. Jim played them for three hours last night and was amazed by the loud and excellent quality tone. \n \nNick, Ottawa :\n \nI like the picks. Crisp and bright. \n \nJ., Ottawa :\n \nHi Steven, I haven't had much of a chance to play with them. I like the immediate response to changes in grip strength, and the tone is good : not much of a change from my jazz 3's for hybrid picking etc. There is much less noise from the pick when playing more funk / rhythmic styles, which may or may not be to the players taste. There was no appreciable drag on wound or plain strings, which I was not expecting! It really is effortless picking. I may end up re shaping the “ shoulders “ as I'm used to the Jazz 3's so these are a little bigger, but as you explained that should be no big deal. I'll send you a photo. \n \nThanks for the trials! Risks and challenges No risk. Already made. Huge interest. Can hand make. Best CNC or molded. Looking for a CNC Aluminum manufacturer. Extremely easy and inexpensive to manufacture. 2 cents of material in bulk prises. Can sell for $1. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

From creepy talking dolls to adorable zombie dogs, Tara bravely battles every bizarre challenge that comes her way.  \n There's even an alternate timeline version of herself: \"Evil\" Tara Normal ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by all the spooky movies I watched growing up in the 1980's on Up All Night with Rhonda Shear , Commander USA's Groovie Movies and USA's Saturday Nightmares , Tara Normal features creepy stories but told with tons of humor and colorful art . Our hero isn't afraid of the monsters hiding under her bed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spirit of Tara Normal is that anything can - and does -happen in this book. If I thought of it, I put it in there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s why Tara encounters such fun characters as Baby Cthulhu, Painbow Fright, the Goatman, Frankenstein Lawyer, a cemetery filled with the zombie versions of 80’s celebrities, and a 70 foot tall Teddy Roosevelt …who carries a trident and lives under the Baltimore Harbor.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can preview more art pages from the book at my website . \nThere are a ton of unique rewards and experiences available including a Jason Hawes autograph reward package, the first ever Tara Normal necklace (designed by Lunar Star Collections ), Tara Normal shirts and much, much more. \nHere are some of the great rewards we are offering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are also able to add-on any item you like to your reward level. Example: Do you want a Tara Normal necklace in addition to your book? Add $20. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've set up stretch goals that can transform this book into a 200 page compendium boasting a huge special features section that includes the first Tara Normal 5 page pitch comic, a giant art gallery and the Tara comic strips as seen in TAPS Paramagazine , the official publication of the show Ghost Hunters on SyFy. In these humorous comics strips, Tara ghost hunts with paranormal reality stars such as Jason Hawes, Grant Wilson, Steve Gonsalves, Dave Tango, Amy Bruni and Adam Berry from the shows Ghost Nation, Ghost Hunters and Kindred Spirits . \n\nI couldn’t create my book - and have copies to sell at the shows to new readers -without your help. Through the past 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns , you’ve helped me continue creating and drawing original, independent comic book stories. \nThank you for celebrating 10 years of Tara Normal with me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges As I'm writing this, the artwork for Tara Normal: The Complete Webcomic Series is 100% completed so any risk is minimal. I have previously run & delivered ON TIME three successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's how to turn your messy Arduino projects for only $2. With this card, you can make your Arduino project that can include wireless card like the popular NRF24L01 or WIFI (ESP8266) or Bluetooth HC06. In addition, your project can have a 2x16 LCD, a 4x4 keypad, two servos, a temperature sensor (1-wire) and an internal 3.7v li-po battery. All in one with this customizable PCB. If you consider the time you save for assembling without even thinking to save time of debugging. All that for less than $2 USD! Why using Pro Mini board? Simply because it is the cheapest (about 2$) and the smallest design with Atmega328P. No need USB interface, just use one FTDI to upload your sketch for all of your projects.  \n\n\nTop side of the Pro Mini Breakout \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBottom side of the Pro Mini Breakout \n \n\n \n\n\nThis PCB is designed for this version of Pro Mini board (3.3v or 5v) \n\n\nUse this version of Pro Mini board (3.3v or 5v).

With each order, I include the two surface mount resistances  (R1 and R2) because not all electronics enthusiast that have it stock. About Rewards: I offer 3 types of rewards: \nA - PCB only (available in quantity of 1/4/8/16 pcs) \nB - PCB with passive components (available in 1/4/8/16 pcs) \nC - PCB with passive components including LiPo battery (available in 1/4/8/16 pcs) \n \n\n* Based on exchange rate of 1,335% from xe.com  on novembre 21th 2015. ***Lipo battery charge warning***\n  As you may have seen in the schematic, there is no electronic management of the battery charge (current, voltage or time limitation). Therefore the user must be very careful when charging the battery. Always charge the battery from a standard USB port and for a maximum of 45 minutes. Charging LiPo batteries can be dangerous if not done carefully. You should always have an eye on the battery when charging. You should know what you do, so be careful.\n Risks and challenges The biggest challenge for this project was to put most of popular components in a small package to meet the maximum needs of Arduino enthusiasts.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\nWe are Haas & Hahn, of the Favela Painting project. Between 2005 and now, the favelas of Rio de Janeiro have provided the inspiration and locations for several public artworks that we painted together with local community members. Each new project being larger than the last, we now we aim to realize our ultimate dream; to plaster and paint an entire hillside favela. With your help we will return to Rio to create this community artwork of unprecedented scale: A monument that will radiate the pride and energy of the people who live in a community that they built with their own hands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsketch for a painted hill in Vila Cruzeiro \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we first visited the favelas in 2005, the way they are built and how they function socially struck us as very beautiful. At the same time they were generally perceived as grim, dangerous and dysfunctional. \nOur project aims to provide an opportunity for people to transform their own neighborhood from a place seen as negative into a place that is able to communicate its creativity, beauty and innovation to the outside world through art. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavela Painting: Rio Cruzeiro, realized in 2008 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile painting the houses brings a visual improvement, plastering them helps with controlling moisture, acoustics and temperature. Through training and hiring, jobs are created in places where opportunities are scarce. More people coming to see the artwork will bring new business and employment opportunities for locals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavela Painters at work \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual beautification, job creation and positive attention boost pride and self esteem and help bridge social gaps in a creative and artful manner. The projects create a voice for the inhabitants, influence public opinion and media, and can help to change perception and remove stigma. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavela Painting: Boy with Kite, 2007 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//How much do we need? In order to realize this dream, every donation counts: 1 dollar could buy us a brush, 100 dollars pays for 10 gallons of paint. 1000 dollars employs a painter for a full month, including insurance, uniform and lunch. Our minimum goal of $100.000 will enable us to  start. We will return to Rio to set up our headquarters and production team, train local youth and get enough materials to start painting and get the Favela Painting project on it's way. But it does not have to stop there. With every extra dollar, more people can be trained and hired and the project can be continued longer. There are hundreds of houses on the hill in Vila Cruzeiro and - if funding is successful - we could paint them all.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//location \n\n\n\nsatelite image of proposed project site in Vila Cruzeiro \n \n\n \n\nOur project site is a central hill in the community of Vila Cruzeiro, part of Complexo da Penha in the North Zone of Rio. We spent extensive time creating our first two projects there and lived in the community for several months. We have many friends there and good contacts with all stakeholders and key figures. Visually, the hill offers a perfect geographical location for a monumental effect.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//donations and rewards \nWe have added a few tiers and rewards to our campaign. Now you can opt for a rewards that will give you a chance to interact with our crew, or to own a part of the actual project. We are sending out used brushes, shirts, flip flops as a memory of Favela Painting. We also offer virtual tours via Skype and penpal relationships with the crew, so you can get personal updates with text and behind-the-scenes snapshots! \n\nEveryone donating more than $25 will receive a membership. You will receive updates, exclusive images, videos and first look at new artworks for sale. You also get a cool Kuvva-wallpaperset and receive an optional mention on our backer-list on our website. $50 dollar donations get a set of large postcards and $75 donations get our popular Favela Painting Tee. We added the option to get a shirt that is actually worn in Vila Cruzeiro, complete with paint splatters. \n\n\n\nFavela Painting \"Pintor\" Shirt \n \n\n \n\nHigher tiers receive exclusive Haas&Hahn artwork. \n\n\n\nHaas&Hahn exhibit at Storefront for Art & Architecture, NYC \n \n\n \n\n\n Donations of $250 receive a beautiful photo by master printer Ruygrok, of either one of our projects (you choose). Backing $500 results in a exclusive-to-the-campaign silkscreen, numbered and signed by Haas&Hahn. The $750 reward is extra special as it's actual production process. During the project, we print our paint plans on hi grade paper. After work we collect all plans - worn and splattered - and signed by both painter and Haas&Hahn. Each one is a different and unique part of the process.  \n\n\n\nExample of paint plan \n \n\n \n\n\nAs we hope to raise as much money as possible, we decided to include all these cool artworks (although our agent was not too happy with this idea) with every donation of $1000. \n\nDonations over $1000 get something  personal. A private virtual tour, your very own on-site barbecue and even a personal visit by Haas&Hahn. This could mean a lecture, a brainstorm session, or maybe just a few beers. We are pretty flexible, so whatever you wish, we will figure it out! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//video \nmore on the work of Haas&Hahn in this short film by Seven Halsema, narrated by Rich Medina: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//organization and fiscal sponsorship \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Favela Painting Foundation supports the creation of striking artworks in unexpected places.

If for any reason it becomes too challenging or unsafe to execute the project in the planned area of Vila Cruzeiro, we will relocate to an equally visually stunning alternative location and still fulfill all project goals as described. Our projects have never gone exactly as planned, but have always yielded results greater than expected. We are flexible, dedicated and work with a great team. We're excited and ready to go.

I am already dreaming of what sounds I will be able to make there.\"   Alvin Lucier, composer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TANK is an acoustical marvel and a sonic wonder of the world, with a shifting, swirling reverberation longer and richer than the Taj Majal or the Great Pyramid. The 65’ tall, 40’ wide empty steel water tank that was discovered in Rangely, Colorado by sound artist and sonic thinker Bruce Odland in 1976 became a place where a small group of musicians and sound artists recorded their music for decades. By 2012, The TANK was in danger of falling silent: No more music, no more sound; rusting and decaying in the elements; left to dust, weather, vandalism, and neglect. To answer this urgency, Friends of The TANK was born, and a “SAVE The TANK” Kickstarter campaign was launched — and funded — in 2013. \n\n\nThe immersive experience of The TANK encourages visitors to learn about sound from within.\nFree to experiment with sounds, movement, and cause-and-effect, these students, on entering The TANK for the first time, come to  listen in a different way​ and​ to understand the mathematics of space through the poetry of the 40 second reverberation. A truly multidisciplinary learning can take place, all while \"playing\" The TANK.   Thanks to almost 800 backers from around the world, The TANK was saved as a world class reverberant space and valued musical resource for all to share. \n\n\n\n\nTom Wasinger and Cameron McCoin relax on the porch with neighbors and friends. \n \n\n \n\n\nIn the three years since achieving our first Kickstarter goal, we have accomplished everything we promised to do in that campaign — and much, much more: \nWe were granted our Change of Use Permit from Rio Blanco County;  \nElectrical service was installed to The TANK and control room;  \nLighting was added, inside and out;  \nLocal volunteers built a new access road;  \nFriends of The TANK became a 501c3 charitable organization;  \nThe TANK GAMELAN was created from a knee-high pipe that used to bisect The TANK;  \nA ventilation fan was installed without changing the acoustics of The TANK;  \nNew parking lots were added for visitors;  \nA safety fence was strung along the cliff;  \nRhino Cubed (in Boulder) built our new recording studio from a shipping container;  \nLocal supporters delivered the recording studio on the back of a flat bed truck;  \nThe recording studio/control room was settled on a vibration-cancelling, Crocs-filled foundation next to The TANK;  \nThe new, full-size door was designed and cut by volunteer metal workers;  \nAn accessible wooden deck was built to welcome visitors, and to link The TANK to the recording studio;  \nA freshly painted floor invites everyone to take off their shoes and move about the space;  \nOur Occupancy Permit from the county was awarded in September 2015;  \nWe were able to give our first legal concert at The TANK Open House during Rangely's Septemberfest 2015;  \nTwelve homeschool students came to The TANK to help us test-run our school outreach program;  \nThe Flobots stopped in Rangely to play in The TANK on their recent \"deTour\" of Colorado. \n \n\n\n .soundcloud .card {\n max-height: 250px;\n }\n .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {\n height: 220px;\n }\n .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {\n height: unset;\n }\n \n\n\n THE GOAL We're back on Kickstarter because it’s time to OPEN The TANK as a fully operational Center for Sonic Arts! The crowdfunding community, including 751 sound lovers and acoustical pioneers from around the world, made it possible to SAVE The TANK. If your name already appears on The TANK wall, we ask you to join us again as we raise the funds to OPEN The TANK to the world. If you're new to The TANK, or to the crowdfunding community, welcome. Together we will continue our journey. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing — OPEN The TANK must reach its goal of $57,000 by February 28th, 3PM EST or we do not receive any funding.

Immersion in The TANK's unique sonic environment provokes an immediate sense of reverence and humility. You realize what all others before you have inevitably realized: The old rules do not apply. Everything must be re-explored and created anew. The TANK is more than a special effect. The TANK is an instrument.\"                                – Jonny 5, The Flobots \n\n\n\n\nThe Flobots conduct a community jam session in The TANK. \n \n\n \n\n\n WHO WE ARE \"Friends of The TANK\" is an eclectic group of artists, sonic explorers, and practical minds bound by a common experience: The TANK. Once again, we have joined together on behalf of this magnificent acoustic resource, this time to OPEN The TANK to the world as a Center for Sonic Arts.

With so much to experience at The TANK, we plan to work with local schools and colleges to develop new ways of learning in this uniquely reverberant space. We hosted a school group in September, 2015, as part of our Open House during Septemberfest. Here is the result. \n\n\nThe TANK is not a product; rather, it is an actual place with hyper-real acoustics where people learn to listen deeply again, understand the joy of music and sound reflecting most vividly from the 70 foot steel walls around them, and refresh the sense of awe and limitless creativity latent within each of us.  \n\n\nLois LaFond sings with Elaine Urie, and Heather Zadra in the early days.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .soundcloud .card {\n max-height: 250px;\n }\n .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {\n height: 220px;\n }\n .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {\n height: unset;\n }\n \n\n\nSound artists O+A, Bruce Odland and Sam Auinger, recorded the sound of the river singing through a Rheinharp, and reverberated the recordings in the magnificent acoustics of The TANK.  We look forward to artists from around the world bringing their projects to The TANK. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges We are committed to making The TANK available for all to share through opening a Center for Sonic Arts in Rangely. We have navigated more than a few obstacles to get where we are, and we have every confidence that we have the commitment and support to meet the challenges ahead. \n\nWe understand that this Kickstarter is just the beginning of the fundraising that will be needed to open and expand a Center for Sonic Arts. By allowing us to solidify our operations and put in place the programs we envision, we believe the support we receive in this Kickstarter campaign will be the key to our future success. \n\nWe promise to keep our supporters informed of our progress, every step of the way.

    "textDescription": "Story Our Kickstarter campaign has ended, what a journey!  Thank you SO MUCH to each and every one of you, you have been a huge part of the next step for Technology Will Save Us.  We’re now busy producing your Movers, painting rainbow snap bands, packaging everything and getting the coding platform ready for your awesome inventions!  You can stay up to date with the Mover journey by signing up to our email updates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForbes’ Toy to Watch in 2016 “This DIY wearable aims to make kids fearless about technology”  — The Verge “The Mover is a STEM toy, for sure, but it’s also a Trojan Horse for getting kids started on computational thinking”  — Wired “Youngsters can gamify everyday tasks such as brushing their teeth or make sports activities more fun”  — LSN:Global “This kit isn’t just about building – the real creativity lies in the fact kids can decide what the rules are themselves and make and code them”  — Forbes What is the Mover Kit? The Mover Kit is an intuitive way for kids ages 8 and over to learn the fundamentals of electronics, programming and solve problems creatively. It encourages kids to learn by doing what they do best - being active and playing!  Right now we are production ready and are turning to you, the Kickstarter community, to get the Mover Kit into the hands of kids everywhere. \n\n\nAs seen on... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've had such wonderful reviews already from BBC News , Fast Company , Forbes , Wired , The Verge , BoingBoing , Wall Street Journal , Cool Mom Tech , Creative Review and Geek Dad ! How it works \n\nYou build it yourself:  Straight out of the box, kids (and parents!) can connect the electronics, case, and accessories together to build their very own Mover Kit. It’s as simple as making a LEGO house or paper airplanes – but way cooler. \n\n\n~ BUILD IT ~ \n \n\n \n\n\nMove it to bring it to life:  Slap it on their wrist, attach it to their scooter, make a disco necklace. Running with the dog, spinning in the backyard, dancing with dad, scooting to school and exploring outside are just some ways to learn and play with the Mover Kit. \n\n\n\n\n~ MOVE IT ~ \n \n\n \n\n\nCode your own games:  Kids can then invent their own apps on the Mover Kit by programming the motion sensor (accelerometer), compass (magnetometer) and rainbow lights (LEDs) with our online platform called Make, designed specifically for kids to make and code. You can program it with up to three different apps at any one time.\n \n\n\n~ CODE IT ~ \n \n\n \n\n\nHelp us reach our stretch goal: $125K! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, you're reading that right: RAINBOW SNAP BANDS! If we reach $125,000 we will give ALL BACKERS rainbow snap bands for their Mover Kits. Snap bands are the bands that keep your Mover Kit firmly on your wrist, bike, or anything that they can fit around. Each snap band will be custom made so no two rainbow patterns will be the same!  Here's how you can pledge: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you pledge, help us spread the word: Inspire every kid in your life by sharing the Mover Kit with their parents, family, educators. How? We made it super easy, just click on one of these buttons and share it!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes in the box?  Everything you need to make your Mover Kit! Build it in 15 minutes, and immediately play with it for hours. Every day can be a new Mover Kit adventure.  Inside you will find (and put together): \nMover board: A printed circuit board with the amazing components affixed  \nRainbow lights: 8 RGB LEDs  \nMotion sensor: Accelerometer  \nCompass: Magnetometer  \nUSB connector: for programming and recharging the battery \nRechargeable battery  \nSnap band bracelet  \nLanyard   \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBuild the Mover Kit and learn how it works \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTa-da! A completed Mover Kit, ready for rainbows \n \n\n \n\n\nMake, Code, Share, Repeat Once the kit is made, kids can use craft, code and creativity to create all kinds of inventions with our safe and kid-friendly Make platform. With this platform kids can easily learn how to code the motion sensor, compass, and rainbow lights no matter what their skill level may be. It also has tons of Mover Kit craft projects made by us and our community – every day can be a new Mover Kit adventure. Plugging the Mover into your computer unlocks a whole new world of activities:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the get go, you can download different apps to your Mover, and even customise them. Apps completely transforms it into something else — a game, a lightsaber or a wizard’s staff: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn to code your own apps using our simple visual coding interface and upload them to your Mover with a simple click of a button. When you’re done, share it with the entire community so they can enjoy the app you invented! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat parents are saying Ije Nwokorie, dad of two and creative powerhouse, talking about how he and his family would use the Mover Kit: \n\n\n\nRoanne cares the Mover will help her child with type 1 diabetes be more active: \n\n\nJ Milligan, dad of two, and kids play and learning expert wishes he was a kid right now:\n \n\n\nDesigning with and for kids\n All of our kits and digital tools are created with a user-centered process that involves kids and parents at every stage — from ideation all the way through to home, park and play testing. \n\n\nAfter testing our prototypes with over 300 kids, we learned that kids love technology that they can wear as it allows them to be engaged and active while having fun. \n\n\n\n\nWe worked with over 300 kids to design the Mover Kit \n \n\n \n\n\nWe’ve also conducted extensive research projects funded by organizations like NESTA, Google and Mozilla, to understand what young people love doing and what skills they are learning both in and out of school.\nDuring this research, we uncovered insights that drove us to create something that would have a real impact on children’s lives: \n\n\n\nKids aren’t getting enough exercise: The World Health Organization suggests that all kids need 60 minutes of exercise every day to stay healthy – sadly most are only getting around 20 minutes! Exercise and movement are the best way to ensure healthy brain activity and we even learn better when we move!  \n\nThere’s a gap between boys and girls in technology: In the 2014 Digital Makers Report, the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (NESTA) found that “76% of girls are interested in digital making, but less interested in learning about technology for its own sake”. We wanted to create something that inspired both boys and girls.  \n\nThere’s not enough making and coding together: Over the last 3 years of making with thousands of kids and parents, we have learned that when you introduce coding alongside crafting and making, it boosts confidence and enthusiasm, leaving kids wanting to learn more. \n People Will Save Us! We launched Tech Will Save Us after we worked for many years in education and design realized it wasn’t moving fast enough for the pace of tech. We also have a child, who was basically born with an iPad, we wanted him to have experiences that were productive and creative with technology not just consuming it. We found that we weren’t alone and this was something many other parents felt as well. \n\n\n\n\nOur range of make it yourself kits for ages 4-104. \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\nWe started small around our kitchen table and have now built a company of 28 passionate designers, educators, engineers and problems solvers - obsessed with inspiriThe awesome team that brought all of this to life\nng kids and empowering parents to become creators of technology.  \n\n\nThe awesome team that brought all of this to life \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDaniel, Ash and Bethany: Co-Founders and Mover Fan #1 \n \n\n \n\n\nKeep following our story  You can download our  Press Kit  here.    Get in touch! MoverKit@techwillsaveus.com THANK YOU! We cannot wait for the new Mover Kit to add some disco rainbow to all of your lives! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Risks and challenges Everyone says it; “hardware is hard”. This is true, and we love it! For over three years we have been building a product business with hardware, software and kids at the center of it.\n\nWe have shipped over 60,000 kits to over 97 countries and have designed a team around making sure we have control and partners to deliver the best end-to-end experience. From the out of the box experience, to our tight supply chain and our customer satisfaction and support.\n\nOf course, there is always the real possibility of things going wrong, and challenges do arise – which is why we have an experienced team of product designers, product managers, manufacturing specialists who are passionately building the best process to deliver the best products.\n\nWe will deliver the Mover Kit with the same detail, quality and robust educational resources as we have become known for. Our community knows, we strive to have the happiest most satisfied customers, and we will welcome our new backers with the same love and high quality support.

    "textDescription": "Story The concept is simple .  Taking the best elements from the original GearPull and the Mini-D, I've created a 3rd (and final) generation product with a slimmer profile, better price point, and improved tensile properties.  The VolksDangler is the peoples' dangler. Just attach keys and/or pocket gear and use the VolksDangler to suspend everything in your pocket or bag. You can now access all your gear in a split second without having to search for it.  The \"deluxe\" models come with 5 premium clips which the Volksdangler has been designed to accommodate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you choose to back this campaign you join an intrepid group of like-minded people who will be the first to experience the VolksDangler....but your reward is only half the story. Thanks to your faith and support, independent makers like myself can subvert the corporate model. Every backer helps to usher in a new form of commerce that brings the power directly to the consumer, and permits makers to set their own terms and succeed on their own merit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to having my deep gratitude and respect, here is what you have to choose from in return for backing my project.  It's fine if you want multiple rewards, read how in the FAQ at he bottom of this page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlow slot enhancement is available for Rewards 1, 2, 3 & 4 as an \"ADD ON\" for an additional $14. Adjust your pledge accordingly if you want green or blue glow. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial: \n\n\nTitanium : Titanium is a sought after material for EDC gear because of its startling strength to weight ratio.  The finish on these is an even and consistent satin grey with low gloss highlights. \n\nStealth Finish : All Stealth units are flat \"Armor Black\" Cerakote over titanium. This is an extremely durable, premium finish mostly used for firearms and is well suited to the rigors of pocket carry. Though it will never fade, peel or flake, it will slowly wear at the high points over time.  All of the Cerakote is done by Jeff Forbush.  Google \"4bushwrs\" if you want to learn more about his services. \n\nMokume gane : In these examples of this exotic material, copper and nickle-silver are heated, laminated and forged to create beautiful patterns resembling wood grain or cloud formations. Each piece is as unique as a fingerprint. The copper will patina as you carry it, enhancing the contrast. That alchemical process is part of what makes Mokume such a pleasure to possess over time. All the Mokume blanks are fabricated by Mike Sakmar. Google \"Sakmar Enterprises\" if you want to learn more about his services. \n\nGlow Slots : These are available as an \"add on\", if you want a glow slot installed you must increase your base pledge amount by $14.   An extra slot is cut in the toe of the VolksDangler and carefully filled flush by hand. Choose from either \"Ultra Green\" which is brighter and glows for 24 hrs., or \"Ultra Blue\" which glows for 9hrs. Both require just 10 minutes of charging. \n \n \n\nYour Support is Critical: If you like my work please share this campaign on your preferred social network, or even just share a link with one friend you think may be interested. The best major social platform you can use to help promote the VolksDangler is Instagram , please consider posting this campaign on your feed, and follow @gamblemade for real time updates from my shop. I'll be working to capacity every day while the campaign is live to get the word out, so any promotional support you may be inspired to provide would be deeply appreciated.  All proceeds will go into fulfilling the promises of this campaign first, and then into purchasing a surplus of parts from my suppliers and collaborators so I can keep it all going after the rewards have been fulfilled. Another portion will be funneled back into research and development. \n\n\nEach Mokume VolksDangler is as unique as a fingerprint. \n \n\n \n\n\nShipping & Delivery: Your VolksDangler will be shipped according to the schedule detailed in the rewards summary on the right of your screen. Basically, you will have yours in hand no later than Nov 31st, 2015. Fulfillment takes as long as it does because I personally grind and form every dangler.  In my past two campaigns every shipping deadline was met, and I'm prepared to do it again. Backers of this campaign will be the first to experience The VolksDangler, as they will not be for sale to the general public until every reward has been fulfilled. US backers get theirs delivered free of charge via 1st class parcel post with delivery confirmation; international shipments only cost $8, and go out via international parcel. Shipping to Canada is $7. The GearPull Family of Danglers. Thanks again to those who backed the original GearPull and the Mini-D here on Kickstarter, none of what I do today would be possible without your enthusiasm and support.  Thanks as well to those of you who are new to my work, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimitless possibilities \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges I've already established firm relationships with my United States collaborators for this project and have tried my best to prevent every foreseeable problem. \n\nI am an obsessive planner, and while I can't prevent every problem, I do have the temperament, experience and integrity to deal with whatever happens in a professional manner. I promise to be transparent, and keep everyone informed with comprehensive monthly updates regarding the progress of the project before and after the funding deadline. There's no pretending that every aspect of a project of this scope will go smoothly, but my backers will be the among the first to know if there are any issues.\n\nThanks again, and please wish me luck!

Over the past year I've been asked to play more and more shows around the Cleveland and Chattanooga area and so many people have asked me for recordings, but I didn't have anything to give! Now, my album is going to be a reality and I can't wait. Several people have offered to record my music, but I've really been clueless about how to make it happen. I didn't want to jump into anything I didn't feel sure about. Thankfully my brother Justin is also a musician and has some friends who are willing to help me out! Stephen Nichols has a wonderful studio in Chattanooga we will be using to record during the first 2 weeks of August. My brother Justin and his friend Randy Cantrell are also going to help me out with arranging music as well as playing various instruments on the album. Using the studio is going to cost $300 a day so we have a ways to go before we have all the money we need to fund this album! We then will also need money to master the tracks and then find a way to package it and put it into the hands of all my lovely supporters who want to hear more tunes from The Mailboxes! Thank each and every one of you for your love and support! There's no way I could do this without you and anything you can give will help.

The game will be presented in an authentic atmosphere set in the world of the 1930/40s - all in high-definition stylized graphics with a new orchestral soundtrack and amazing sound effects! All of the game's action sequences will be vastly enhanced while staying true to the spirit of the original game. \n\n\n\nFight the enemy and uncover secret locations! \n \n\n \n\n\nAmong the original gameplay elements that will come back are: \n\nDogfighting sequences against a larger variety of enemies and scenarios! \n \nExciting shoot-outs at secret, expanded Nazi locations! \n \nBoxing punch-outs against multiple enemy guards! \n \nStrategic-decision making as you deploy and manage your secret agents' moves! \n \n\nRocket and weapons research at the Fort Dix labs! \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we REALLY do not want to stop there! Help us go beyond the minimum funding goal and we will further enhance the game with a much deeper plot, an expanded cast of characters, new action sequences and gameplay mechanics, multiple additional scenarios and secret locations to discover, a deeper strategic component and lots of additional futuristic gear and weapons to find which will reload Rocket Ranger to the next level! \n\n\n\nRocket Ranger - Reloaded! \n \n\n \n\n\nReloaded vs. Remastered? \nSo, what is the difference between a \"remastered\" and \"reloaded\" game by Cinemaware you may ask? \nWith Wings! Remastered Edition , we stayed true to the original source material and remastered the audio-visual components of the game, keeping (almost) everything else intact. Read for yourself what others have to say about it!   Critics were equally vocal: \n\"Wings! Remastered Edition does everything right.\" (Hooked Gamers, 85%) \n\"...one of the best remastered games that I ever played.\" (NeoGamer Germany, 90%) \n\n\n\nFight The Future before it arrives! \n \n\n \n\n\nIn Rocket Ranger Reloaded, with your help we intend to go one step beyond: we will not only bring back all the original source material that made the game great back in 1988 (while enhancing several of its shortcomings), but we will also boost and expand it with tons of new content (locations, gadgets, weapons, equipment, outfits, characters, vehicles, etc.), gameplay upgrades, brand-new action and story sequences, a deeper strategic component and several new characters that will come together to greatly increase the replayability and help fulfill the great vision of this unique game! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nearly concept art \n \n\n \n\n\nHere are just a few of the exciting new things we have planned: \n\n\n\nNew locations in a broader world map with several additional countries to visit! \nSpecial locations such as islands, ships, submarines, underwater bases and other secret spots to discover! \n \n\nAdditional abilities that can be assigned to your agents! \nEnhanced and expanded RPG-style features! \n \n\nNew action sequences such as trench runs, fighting tanks, stratosphere shootouts and manning vehicles! \nThe ability to research weapons and gadgets! \n \n\nExpanded functions on your Telefunken wrist monitor! \nAnd many, many more! \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We beg you to help us. After the Nazis won the war,\nHitler's Third Reich established a world government run by the Führer's\nfascist puppets, an empire of evil governments dominating the entire\nearth. The members of our group are scientists forced to work at a Nazi\nweapons research facility located at the place you called Fort Dix, New\nJersey. But it bears little resemblance to the Fort Dix from 1940. The\nbuilding housing our laboratories occupies the site of your laboratory; so\nwe are in the same physical space, although we exist in different\ntimes. \n \n\nWe live and work as prisoners, forced to collaborate with the Nazi\nscientists developing new technologies for their conquest of space, and other advanced technologies and weaponry. Our loved\nones are held as hostages, allowed to live only as long as we continue to\ncollaborate.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Ranger Reloaded is being produced by a team of very experienced and talented developers , including all members of the team who brought you Wings! Remastered Edition ! \nThe team has also got some other incredible game credits such as NBA Jam, Shadowman, Mega Man Anniversary Collection, Jackie Chan Adventures, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and Cinemaware’s own Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown and many classic Amiga classics such as Spellbound Dizzy, Switchblade 2 and Pegasus. \n\n\n\n\nThe Rocket Ranger Team! \n \n\n \n\n\nIt is a team that has been together and working on game development for over 30 years, all of whom love Cinemaware games and retro gaming in general. \nFinally, Doug Barnett (Cinemaware alumnus and writer/game designer of Lords of the Rising Sun ) will also be collaborating with us on the game design, great new content and future story extensions if YOU help us reach our funding goals! \n\n\n\n\nSome of our released titles! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\"In the future, no power is great enough to resist the Greater Reich; but in your time, there is a chance. We believe that someone, armed with the right tools and advance warning of coming events can stop them. \nThough the Nazis have rewritten history to justify their perverted doctrines, we have uncovered proof that they should not have been able to win the war. We've learned that the country you call the United States was the world's strongest industrial power. With enough time to marshal her resources, the United States and her allies could have defeated the Nazis.\" \n\n\n\nZeppelin Fleet, 1940 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\"But in 1940 the balance of power suddenly shifted. German technology quickly leaped ahead several decades and the Nazis won the war before America could intervene. According to legend, in 1938 an expedition to Tibet led by members of the Thule Society discovered SOMETHING that allowed them to accelerate the speed at which new weapons were developed. Shortly after, the discovery of the moon mineral Lunarium, a new powerful fuel source, gave their technology a huge advantage over the Allies.\" \n\n\n\nZeppelin Fleet...2039? \n \n\n \n\n\n\"In support of their armies, the Nazis also attacked in Zeppelins that flew in the stratosphere, so high that even the newest Allied fighter planes could not reach them. There was no defense against the power of these Death Ships. Entire nations were conquered from the air by the Nazi Zeppelin fleet and many other miracle weapons.” \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRocket Ranger Reloaded’s original score will be composed by Sound of Games - #1 in Premium Game Music  and collaborator in our successful Wings!

During the development of Wings! Remastered Edition , we listened closely to our fans' feedback and criticisms to make that game what fans wanted to see. We believe we largely succeeded but feel there is still lots to do! \n\n\n\n\nRocket pack upgrades - early concept art \n \n\n \n\n\nWith Rocket Ranger Reloaded, we want to show our fans and the gaming community at large that Cinemaware's classic games have not only an important place in gaming's history but can also once again become highly innovative and original works of interactive entertainment and storytelling. \n\nWe want to keep delivering highly entertaining and accessible titles that place a lot of importance on atmosphere, art style, characters and emotions which ultimately touch the heart - and soul - of our fans. \n\n\nHowever, we can realistically only achieve this lofty goal with the support and active involvement of our community. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully funding and releasing Wings! Remastered Edition to a warm reception by Cinemaware fans and critics alike , we believe Rocket Ranger Reloaded will represent the next step in our evolution towards ever more exciting and unique gaming experiences.  Rocket Ranger Reloaded marks the second title in a new generation of Cinemaware games that we are planning to bring back. Many more are in the works, like Defender of the Crown and It Came from the Desert – and with YOUR help and continuing support, we will develop Rocket Ranger Reloaded into another successful game for all our fans to enjoy!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have demonstrated, we will continue to listen closely to our fans and community and are confident this project will represent another big stepping-stone towards an exciting future for Cinemaware fans and gamers everywhere!\n \n\n\nPlease share this campaign with your friends, family and gaming community at large.

It will be a larger, more complex project that will require more resources due to its highly non-linear game structure. High replayability is one of our aims with this game and this requires a lot more content to be created.\n\nIn addition, we are completely overhauling the visual presentation and art direction of the game, many of the original game sequences, including introducing brand-new gameplay mechanics. These objectives will take time and resources to develop and fine-tune properly in order to meet our fans' expectations, as a lot of experimentation and trial & error is involved. Our community's involvement (and patience) will be crucial to this project's ultimate success.\n\nWe truly hope we can raise more than the minimum funds to fully realize the vision for Rocket Ranger Reloaded. It is a title that deserves a lot of care and attention to detail, like all Cinemaware titles. \n\nUltimately, it is YOU who will decide how far this project can go and how Rocket Ranger will be able to FIGHT THE FUTURE!

    "textDescription": "Story WHAT'S IT ABOUT? \"So You Like the Neighborhood\" is an offbeat crime thriller/comedy. It's based on something that happened to me last summer. It tells the story of a girl who is being evicted from her Brooklyn apartment of 12 years. She goes to drown her sorrows at a nearby bar. There she befriends some locals, who offer to help her with the eviction. They just so happen to be former mafia members, and by \"help,\" they mean something more nefarious.  WHY CONTRIBUTE? Making films, even short films, is insane-oh expensive. Especially in New York City! Even when you try and do things on the cheap, it adds up fast! For an aspiring director, a strong short film can be hugely instrumental for professional growth and exposure. Shorts are the first step in the journey of forging a career in film directing.  Your help, however small, is invaluable in this process.  WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO This is a micro-budget movie, and shooting in New York City is tough and expensive. My cast and crew is working for free, on a deferred basis, or at drastically reduced rates. NYU provides some resources to help bring down the cost, but there are still many expenses that require your support! These include: Cast, Crew, food, permits, Locations, equipment trucks, camera lenses, Hair & Make-up, Sound Mixing and Sound Design, Grip & Electric Rentals, etc. etc.  DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT \"So You Like the Neighborhood\" combines suspense, sarcastic humor, thoughtful eccentricity and the threat of violence. It is ultimately a story about unlikely friendship and taking responsibility in one's life. I like to mine for the humor inside dark, sinister worlds, and to infuse all of my films with comedic elements. A film with a similar tone would be Scorsese’s \"After Hours.\" Visually I like to use muted colors and pools of shadow. I love creating creepy soundscapes (whale mating calls being a personal favorite); worlds where there is always something nightmarish lurking outside; worlds that are missing the moral framework necessary for producing your typical heroes. While in the NYU Grad Film program, I directed three films similar in tone, two of which did very well on the festival circuit.

Why this matters: Student engagement is one of the best predictors of academic success, and there are few things more engaging than designing and building something with your hands.  Education leaders like Sir Ken Robinson and Salman Khan have called for more creative and integrated projects in schools, but many districts just don't have the resources or space to support these kinds of activities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe truck: With your help, we'll find and outfit a delivery truck with cutting-edge maker tools and software (like laser cutters, 3D printers, and hand tools) and drive from school to school bringing teachers and students the resources and equipment they need to create engaging, educational activities.  We'll use our expertise in making, education and technology to help teachers come up with creative ways to teach their curriculum, and enable them to bring more excitement into their classrooms. UPDATE: We have a truck (for now)!!! HUUUGE THANK YOU to Matt Hengehold of Hengehold Trucks for letting us borrow one of his 11' step vans until the end of June!

    "textDescription": "Story The oldest recorded town in Britain! Something anyone from Colchester will almost certainly tell you if you ever give them just half a chance. Something to be proud of maybe? Unfortunately it seems the food in the town centre might be vying for the same title (except noodle bar. if you know, you know). Yes, the town centre has 'the chains' and a fair few places to get that guilty (but so good) burger after a night out, even a swanky new hotel to go and posh it up at, but let's be honest that's about it! Hardly blazing a culinary trail are we.  Could it be we're getting left behind? Our Food \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's where we come in. grain . Yes a pretentious one word restaurant name, is going to change all that.  We are going to redefine how a restaurant in Colchester operates.  No more of the boring, run of the mill menus.  Instead we're going to offer modern British food, small plates all starter sized and all priced that way. Of course fresh, of course the best we can produce and of course as local as we can get, that is the promise we aim to fulfill at grain.  So instead of the usual, getting stuck with the 3 courses you settled for, have 4, have 5, have 6, have the whole menu if you want. After all variety (not nutmeg) is the spice of life. Then leave feeling full, satisfied and not wondering if you missed out on the 'other' dessert the table next door had. With money left in your wallet or at least invested in a nice bottle of red rather than in the 'discretionary' service charge we're all too polite to refuse nowadays. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Experience We want you to feel comfortable. There'll be no front of house/back of house divide, the people that cook your food will serve your food, one team completely immersed in every aspect of making grain tick. A dedicated bunch of multi skilled, uber-passionate hospitality professionals.  Trained in some of the top restaurants in the area and across Europe, we're talking about top quality food (or at least the best we can muster) in a comfortable, relaxed environment.  You can have a chat with the chef that cooked your meal, indulge in some top drawer cooking, enjoy a bottle of quality wine (or two) or discover a new craft beer and above all else feel at home from the minute you walk in to the time you leave. Who are we? Paul  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan (Sid) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChances are you won't know us, but we are committed to making grain happen. It all started with a shared vision working together 3 years ago, wanting to open a restaurant we wanted to eat in, serving top end food, our food, without all the stuffy pretentiousness that normally goes with it.  We're passionate about doing things our way, and it just happens our way meant throwing the rule book out the window.  But we're still conventional chefs, we'll be using local produce, making everything fresh, from scratch to the highest standard and in time we hope to work with the community and support not just the local trades but also you, if your allotment is overstocked with tomatoes or you have a garden full of chickens laying eggs, let's talk. We want the people of Colchester to feel part of the project too. Let us turn your hard earned efforts in to something fantastic and sharing the rewards from it. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does Kickstarter come in? Now we've kind of fallen on our feet.  After years of graft and hard saving it just happens a property came on the market. In our home town of Colchester. In the town centre. In good enough condition that it's almost ready to go. So, we scraped together every penny we have between us (£30000), did a little creative borrowing from the bank (£25000) and we just about have enough to open.  But we don't want to just 'open' we need just a little lift from you. To enable us to make grain the restaurant experience we always imagined.  So the £10000 we hope to raise through kickstarter will give us the funds to stock the wine shelves, fill the fridges, buy the pots, the pans, the cups, the plates, the knives, forks and spoons. Generally to make sure we're 100% ready to give you the experience we think you deserve. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rewards The beauty of Kickstarter is it's not a charity.  You're not just giving us your money.  You're buying something from us, the moment you pledge your money (if we're successful) you're a customer at grain : a restaurant that will exist, by hook or by crook by the end of the summer.  Just look at it as pre payment, and how nice is it to think that at some point you'll get to come and have a meal and perhaps a few drinks and not have to worry about the bill at the end of it (because lets face it, that's the part everyone hates regardless of cost) \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Anyone that knows a thing or two about the restaurant trade will know its tough. The hours, the stress, the surrender of social life - but we're used to that, unfortunately so are our loved ones.\nBut the reality is a very high percentage struggle to make it past the first year and even less make it past five. Its a sobering statistic but we've considered it, done our research, crossed our t's and dotted our i's and we're confident we can make it work on our business plan in the current market. It will be tough but we're ready for every challenge it throws at us, more to the point we're looking forward to conquering them and for our customers to be part of the journey and grow with us.\nSomething else to consider is this is going to be our first restaurant and that will only add to the challenge. Professionally we are up to the challenge. We've amassed the skills we need to run a successful restaurant, we've even opened one or two for other people. Along with the contacts we have developed in our careers and friends in the industry that are already offering their support along the way so we certainly don't feel like we're doing this alone.\nYes there will always be competition, yes there will inevitably be somewhere newer or cheaper to eat, we know that. But we are offering something different, somewhere everyone can feel comfortable, where the food is as good as if not better than anywhere in the area, run by people who genuinely care about their craft and their customers. We're confident we'll go from strength to strength with you. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

We are so excited to finish making the book and get it into your hands. Making a photo-illustrated children's book is an expensive process. It's a lot like making a movie. We need to pay for actors and locations and camera equipment. We're absolutely thrilled to have met our original goal! Now we're pushing for $20,000 so we can make the book even better.  The more money we raise, the more incredible and magical the book will be. We want to inspire a generation of kids to be brave and learn to face their fears, so let's give it all we've got. Additional money raised will go toward the production of the images and allow for better printing, so everyone that backs the book benefits. Let's do this! \n\n Update 7/4: New Pictures! We've been hard at work making new images and finishing up the storyline for the book. Here's a little scene that didn't make the cut, with some adorable lettering and doodles by Valerie Navarro . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho We Are Hi! We're Mitch (human) and Vivian (dog), and together we're making \"Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn,\" a children's book about a big dog moving to the \"big city.\" Mitch is the writer and photo-illustrator, and Vivian plays the part of the adorable giant dog. In our five years together, we've moved around a lot—four states, five cities, and 10 different apartments or houses. We've been in Brooklyn for two years, and love it, so we're settling down ;). No matter how many times you move, it's always difficult, especially when you're young. Every year, over 5.5 million kids between the ages 1 to 9 move to a new home, in the United States alone.* It's scary to leave behind the home and people you love when you relocate. So we're making a photo-illustrated children's book about a dog who moves to a new city to help kids who are going through a similar experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Book \"Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn,\" is a book about a big dog moving from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Brooklyn, New York. It's 32 pages long and will be full of beautiful photo-illustrations created by Mitch and starring Vivian, with some pretty fantastic letterings and drawings by the talented, Valerie Navarro (http://thisisval.com ). In the book, Vivian is a giant dog—over 6 feet tall! She loves the wide open spaces and delicious foods of New Mexico, but most of all, she loves playing with her best friend, \"the human.\" When Vivian learns she and the human are moving to New York City, aka the \"Big City,\" she gets very excited. She believes everything will be as big as she is in the \"Big City,\" and she can't wait to move! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might guess, she's pretty disappointed upon arriving in New York City and discovering that she is still the only giant wiener dog around. Things get worse, as she quickly learns their neighborhood in Brooklyn can be a pretty cramped place, especially for a big dog like her. She barely fits in their new living room! She decides to leave the human behind and return to Albuquerque on her own. Does she make it back, or does she get lost along the way? You'll have to get the book to find out! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Photo-Illustrations are Made Vivian is not actually 6 feet tall in real life, so there's a bit of behind-the-scenes magic that goes into each image. Making photo-illustrations is kind of like making a small movie with some big visual effects. We use some of the same techniques that VFX artists use to make people different sizes in movies like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings—a little bit of camera trickery, and a dash of computer effects. Mitch learned many of these tricks in his past life as a VFX Artist, working on movies and commercials for TCHYA! and Spotwelders . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we start with a sketch or storyboard of the scene. This is the initial step in getting the image out of Mitch's head and onto the page. The first sketch is usually very basic, sometimes just a few scribbles. Planning the image out on paper makes the actual shoot go much smoother. Next, Mitch makes a list of props and equipment needed to make the picture work and plans the photo shoot. Some pictures are very simple and don't need much more than Vivian and a pretty background, but some are much more complex and require other actors, props and special camera equipment and lights. \n\nNow it's time to shoot! Most of the pictures are actually a mixture of several images, called a composite. It's important to get all of the shots on the same day, with the same lighting. Otherwise, they might look and feel \"off\" to the viewer, pulling them out of the story's narrative. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast of all, we pull the images from the photo shoot together on the computer. It's always fun to watch the final image start to come together. Each picture takes a lot of time and energy to make, but it's always worth it when you see the final result. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy We are Raising Money on Kickstarter Making a photo-illustrated children's book can be very expensive. We're raising money on Kickstarter for three main reasons: to help print the first batch of books, to pay for a trip to Albuquerque to shoot the scenes set there, and to help find and pay for Vivian's K9 co-star in the book, Lulu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Printing costs Printing is much cheaper when done in bulk, so we've set a goal that will help us print a modest, first run of books. Each book is 32 pages long and is hardcover with a beautiful dust-jacket. If we raise even more money, we can upgrade to a premium printer like Hemlock Press, the company that prints books and magazines for The Great Discontent and Kinfolk ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Trip to Albuquerque to shoot on location Unlike a traditionally illustrated book, each item in a photo-illustrated book needs to be photographed. If you want to set your book in Albuquerque, for example, you either need to build a set that looks like Albuquerque or travel there. We ran the numbers, and it's much cheaper to fly to Albuquerque and shoot with a local crew than it is to rent a space and build a set in New York, where we live. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Finding and paying for Vivian's Co-Star, Lulu! Who is Lulu? She's only Vivian's new K9 BFF/spiritual guide! Vivian runs into Lulu, a \"normal-sized dog\" shortly after deciding to return to Albuquerque. Lulu helps Vivian find her way... or does she? Again, you'll have to get the book to find out! \n\nIf you know a pup that you think would be the perfect Lulu, tag them on Instagram with the hashtag: #VivianNeedsLulu  or emailing us: findlulu@vivianthedog.com . We'll be checking! Bonus points if they live in New York and they share our project! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline We've finished the story and initial manuscript, done some test shoots, and begun meeting with children's book editors, but there is still a lot to do before printing the book. Here's our project timeline: June 2016: Kickstarter campaign July 2016: Finalize story and shooting manuscript with the editor August - September 2016: Shoot New York/Brooklyn scenes October 2016: Shoot Albuquerque scenes November - December 2016: Post-production on the images, begin layout, Valerie Navarro's letterings and drawings are added January 2017: Final reviews with the editor, and reshoots if neededFebruary 2017: Layout is finalized, files sent to the printer March 2017: Review and finalize proofs from the printer, assemble rewards packages and prepare for shipment April 2017: Ship books and other rewards! This book is a passion project, and Mitch works full-time as a photographer and director (He also doodles a bit! You may have seen some of his images on Broad City's Instagram , or Radiolab's new podcast ). This timeline provides enough breathing room to work our day jobs, finish the book, and deliver the rewards to you on time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards We have a bunch of cool rewards for our backers. Every little bit helps, and we can't say thank you enough for backing our project, but we'll try!

Our Story Mitch and Vivian have been together since birth—Vivian's birth, that is. Mitch's sister's dog had puppies and Vivian was one of them. They've been having adventures together ever since. You can follow them on Instagram and Facebook .  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Boyer is the author and photo-illustrator behind \"Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn.\" He came up with the idea after making a series of photos showcasing Vivian's \"true size,\" like many dachshunds she thinks she's much bigger than she actually is. In addition to being a writer and photographer, Mitch works as director and illustrator. His career highlight was when Charlize Theron looked him in the eye and said, \"You're in my light.\" He's done work for Saturday Night Live, Lady Gaga, New York Public Radio, and more. You can see his work at mitchboyer.com . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValerie Navarro  can make pretty much anything and works as a creative producer, visual artist, and assistant food stylist. She and Mitch worked together as creative partners at their last job and have continued collaborating ever since. Val's creating the lettering and doodle illustrations for the book. She loves puppies and food videos, and her acai bowls are to die for. You can see some of her work at thisisval.com . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivian  is the greatest dachshund that ever lived (by her own estimation). She has two great loves in life: food and food. She's much smaller than she appears in the book—but her personality is giant. She loves long walks and even longer naps. If you want more Vivian in your life, you can follow her on Instagram: @iamvivianthedog . This is not the first time Mitch and Val have made Vivian the subject of a side-project. \n\n\nThe first Vivian side-project: a collage made from magazine snippets \n \n\n \n\n\nContact Info Email: kickstarter@vivianthedog.com Website: vivianthedog.com Press kit: bit.ly/vivpress Vivian Instagram: @iamvivianthedog Vivian Facebook: Vivian the Dog Mitch Instagram: @mitchwayneboyer Val Instagram: @thisisval Thanks!

A case could be made that sexual abuse by Catholic priests or his IRA family connections contributed to his path. But he'd admit it all came down to rebellion and love of drugs and alcohol. Christopher did time in juvenile detention, Wexford Jail, and Mountjoy Prison (AKA 'The Joy') by the time he was 30. He befriended Dublin's leading criminal figures including some of the Dunne Family and \"King Scum\" Tony Felloni, who was instrumental in bringing heroin into Dublin in the 1970s.  Christopher's criminal activities grew to be a full-time job when he became addicted to heroin. His addiction got so bad that he and his girlfriend decided to trade heroin for cocaine. They came to Bogota with the intention of muling 4 kilos back to Ireland. They were caught by Colombian police at El Dorado airport. Christopher served 3 years in Colombia's largest prison, La Modelo, where he befriended M-19 guerrilla insurgents , infamous cocaine cartel assassins 'Los Priscos', and the more rank-and-file of Colombia's underworld - mafiosos , thieves, conmen , killers , and more. He was released in 1989 and, having relinquished his passport, has been stranded in Colombia ever since. He traded his previous heroin addiction for debilitating alcoholism on the streets of Bogota at a time when TIME Magazine called it the world's worst city, the capital of the world's most dangerous country. Prison rape, riots , murder , torture , bank robberies, scams, hardcore partying, addiction , hedonism, and a life of crime. It's Basketball Diaries meets Marching Powder in Dublin, Ireland and Bogota, Colombia.  Everything above and more is part of his story. I have already recorded hours of intensive interviews on Christopher's entire life. All I need to make his amazing life story a book is the time off work . I'm asking for $4,399 to deliver this book in exactly 60 days from when it's funded. Be a part of the effort to make This Mick's Life a reality! Risks and challenges The only risk this project faces is NOT BEING FUNDED. \n\nIf the community raises $4,399 so I can support my family for two months, I WILL DELIVER This Mick's Life in 60 days.

A cannonball explodes in front of you.\nYou’re thrown backward, dazed. The sound of ringing fills your\nears. Men fire guns. Swords clash. Then one\npirate turns in your direction. He smiles cruelly. Knife drawn, he\nstalks toward you. Should you race\nafter your friends toward the fort? Pirates are already chasing them.\nOr is it better to escape to the left, in the direction from which\nthe pirates just came? There might be more pirates that way.\nWhat will you choose to do? Choose Your Path This is Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic pirate novel, Treasure Island , retold in the Choose Your Path format. The reader becomes Jim Hawkins. He must first survive the voyage to Treasure Island and then outwit a band of pirates to escape with the gold. The story has been adapted with care to be appropriate for readers, ages 9–13.  This is a pro-literature adventure/survival story for boys. It is written with reluctant readers in mind, but its format appeals to boys and girls alike. Even a few adults have told us they love these books. The path is yours to choose.

This will be the 4th year show show has been running, and its gets better and draws in more people each and every year! We started with just one singing pumpkin and sixteen channels of lights. We are now at four singing pumpkins with 1,068 channels of lights. The shows have been seen by thousands of people all over the world. Last year the show was featured in an online article http://gma.yahoo.com/top-7-outrageous-halloween-houses-214835771--abc-news-house-and-home.html  for Good Morning America on the Yahoo! homepage.

I think promotion is definitely the hardest. Trying to get as many people to come see the show is pretty difficult. Word seems to spread by itself. Another challenge is troubleshooting the problems of some faulty equipment. With this project it will help get rid of some of the faulty equipment.

    "textDescription": "Story This is basically a reiteration of the video but as I writer I understand reading something over watching it.  Anyway, if you don't know me already my name is Peter Helm, I'm 23 years old.  I am a philanthropist, artist and writer and I want to write kids books for a living.  Ever since I was young my big dream was to write meaningful picture books that would be able to positively impact children and adults alike.  With that dream in mind and the encouragement of friends, family and teachers alike I've created two kids books I am really proud of and want to share with the world! And after many revisions, getting my BFA, and paying off school I finally feel like the books are complete and I am ready to publish them!  Unfortunately, publishers right now don't feel the same.  The reason comes down to is there aren't any willing to take chances with new picture book writers right now. There hasn't been that many successful picture books recently so justifiably publishers aren't looking for anyone.  They're not looking period.  \"It's not you- it's me\" attitude.  But I've never been one to give up just because someone tells me so (in this case at least 15 times).  I have good stories that I want to share with the world and I'm not going to give up!  I know they'll do well and I am determined to make it happen.  And with your help I hope I can afford to.  So without further ramblings I should introduce the very thing I'm working at:  The books. The first is the Lonely Lonely Chameleon .  The story -without spoiling too much- is about a chameleon who lives in a forest with all sorts of animals that don't look anything like it and so they all avoid it leaving the Lonely Lonely Chameleon sad and-well lonely  But The Lonely Lonely Chameleon is not without any friends, it has one- The Dear Dear Turtle who loves it despite its odd odd shapes.  Unfortunately the Dear Dear Turtle is so popular among all the other animals that it often doesn't have enough time to play with the Lonely Lonely Chameleon.  With that the Lonely Lonely Chameleon goes off on a quest to find a place that it can home and venture on a perilous journey to discover what true friendship is about, understanding who you are and caring for others for who they are.  The book has a lot of double word play (ie Lonely Lonely Chameleon, Dear Dear Turtle etc), and few tongue twisters and silly phrases here and there that I think both adults and children alike can enjoy.  The drawings are a contrast of straight lines right next to natural lines going with theme of the book and the coloring was done with the same themes in mind and I don't want to get too into it so as to take away from the storyline but my point is is that all of the book is done intentionally to create a story that I think many would enjoy. The second book is Sometimes Life Can Be Scary which shifts gears toward a little more serious of a subject that I feel isn't touched on very often with picture books and that is: Being sad and scared.  And that is what this book confronts: dealing with those scared and sad feelings and knowing what to do with them.  Because I think that children should know that life can be scary at times.  I also think sadly a lot of children know that far more than they should and they need a book that understands the pain that comes along with that and more importantly tells you are s pecial , you are wonderful and life is worth fighting for because life can also be great!  This book is completely different from The Lonely Lonely Chameleon in both art style and message and I think that's appropriate considering that the subject matter is completely different.  Sometimes Life Can Be Scary has a rhyme scheme throughout the entire books.    I wrote this book at the time for someone very dear to me to help them with their struggles and I want share this book with the world now for everyone that is going through rough times, has gone through rough times or will go through rough times and know there is light at the end of the tunnel! And now that I have given you what the books are I want to tell you what I will do to make this vision a reality.  1. I want to get these books cataloged with ISBN #'s.  That way they are official books that can be universally looked up 2. Once given numbers, I will publish them online electronically via ebooks, kindle, nook and whatever other means I can distributing it to as many places as I can justify. I would love to go physical format but I think starting here will be best (And with the profit of the books online I will pursue hard covers). 3. I will market the books with reviewers, ads, blogs and things of that matter to get them noticed and seen by many.  Ultimately people have to know about the books to buy them. 4. Reward those who helped me make my dream a reality.  I will email everyone who donated an electronic copy of the book via whichever option is most accessible to the donor and whatever else I promised to go with it based on the amount donated. 5. I will move forward and keep making kids books, maybe even make these animated books so people can watch them.  Maybe even sell them in physical book form so people can buy them at bookstores.  But it has to start here, and I know will eventually get to there with your help.  So with that I apologize for being long winded, and I thank you for your time and whatever you can allocate will be appreciated and used wisely for the pursuit of my dream and ultimately for good use.  Thank you.

These two geeks--some might say uber-geeks--have the knowledge,\nthe skills, and the necessary lack of sense to track down the truth\nabout the mysteries of our world. No danger is too great. No mystery\ntoo deep. No haunted house too scary** for the… GEEK SEEKERS! \nGeek Seekers is a web series about\ngeeks and the paranormal--two great tastes that taste great together,\nwe think. In each episode two geeks will investigate some strange\nlocation or phenomena. Ghosts, UFOs, bigfoot… these are the kinds\nof things the Geek Seekers will investigate. In the geekiest way\npossible. In Geek Seekers, you'll see a mixture of real\ninvestigations, geekly discussions, and the occasional bit of\nsilliness, just for good measure. What will the Geek Seekers find? Ghosts? Ogopogo? Aliens? What craziness will they instigate on their own? What trouble will they find themselves in as they do this crazy stuff? \nAnd the most important question of all: do you want to watch\nthem do all that? \n\n*Not\nreally. \n**Well,\nmaybe. I mean, there might be some screaming. And running. Expect\nsome running. \nWhat Is This Project? \nGeek Seekers is a web series starring\nus, Jen Page and Monte Cook. We're a couple of geeks, fascinated by\nthe paranormal and the mysterious. One day, while talking about our\nshared love of all things weird and unexplained, we decided to\ninvestigate some of the most intriguing mysteries first hand. And we\nwanted to start big. So we figured, let's try to find Area 51. That's\nright. Eventually, we're going all the way to the unknown reaches of the Nevada\ndesert looking for UFOs, secret government bases, and anything else\ninteresting to a couple of geeks--and we're going to film it. But first we're going to hunt for ghosts, bigfoot, and other fun paranormal stuff.  Now,\nwe'll be honest with you. Knowing us, there's going to be some\nsilliness, and more than a little geekery. We might spend our down\ntime chatting about movies, gaming, and things like that. That's\ngoing to be a part of the series too. But the investigation is for\nreal. We are serious about wanting to really do what we can to\nuncover various mysteries. That's why it's a series. There's just so much\nto explore! We may be geeks who like to joke around, but wouldn't it\nbe amazing if we also actually get some evidence of something for\nreal? On film? For everyone to watch? \nWho Are You Guys? Jen Page: An actor, a\nfilmmaker, and a model, Jen has already cemented herself in the geek\nworld. Her recent acting projects allowed her to become a rebellious\nalien, a crafty sorceress rogue and a vampire (twice).  As a\nchild, though, Jen dreamed of being even more than that. Jen’s wild\nimagination convinced her she could be a superhero when she grew up.\nOr perhaps a cowboy gypsy scientist ghost hunter. All her life people\ntold her that she wasn't being realistic, but she ignored\nthem.Finally, she met someone that agreed with her. After talking\nto Monte, Jen realized that she could ghost hunt, fight Bigfoot, read\npalms and wear some kick ass goggles; all while talking geekery with\nher genre-appropriate co-host. Monte Cook: Monte\nis that D&D guy. He's never had a real job. For most of his adult\nlife, he's stayed at home writing novels, game books, articles, and\nshort stories. He designed Heroclix, co-wrote 3rd Edition D&D, and is working on some new D&D thing.\nHe even wrote a book about conspiracy theories, aliens, and kooky\nstuff like that. It never occurred to him until he met Jen that he\ncould actually go out and investigate UFOs, ghosts, and  the\nparanormal first hand. Even better, she added, \"and when we do,\nlet's film it!\"Now action-oriented Monte has a new rule. He\nnever does anything that he can't justify to his 16-year-old self\nshould he ever travel back in time. When reached for comment\nregarding Geek Seekers, 16-year old Monte said, \"Sounds cool.\nCan we talk about movies, games, and other geeky stuff on the way to\nthe investigations?\" Yes, 16-year old Monte, yes we can. What is the\nFunding For? Gear. Obviously, we need\ncameras, decent lights, and things like that. We'd also really like\nto get some specialized equipment. For what we want to do,\nwe need EMF detectors, motion sensitive cameras, and other cool\ngeekery. We're serious about this. Unfortunately, that stuff is\nexpensive. \nTravel expenses. We need to travel to various planned\ninvestigation sites. We're discussing going down to\nCalifornia and to various locations around the Pacific Northwest, and perhaps even up to Canada. \nAnd probably some No-Doz, because the\nUFOs and ghosts are best seen at late at night. \nMaybe a couple of sandwiches? A bag of\nchips? Some kind of junk food for the trip. We are geeks, after all.\nOur Mountain Dew budget is astronomical. \nWhat Will the Finished Series Be\nLike? If the project gets fully funded, we\naim to do an estimated season of six episodes, each between 7 and 15\nminutes long. \nSome investigations might carry over\ninto multiple episodes, while others might be self-contained. Much of this is still up in the air. The money we're asking for will mostly just get us started with those first few episodes. If we go beyond that (or have a second campaign later), we'll be able to do more episodes and eventually even get to Area 51. \nWhen we conduct an investigation, we'll\ndo our homework. In each episode, we'll provide the\nbackground--hopefully in an entertaining way--so you know what we're\nlooking for. Each episode will involve us doing all that we can to\nget to the truth behind the stories we've been told. \n \nOf course, in investigations like this,\nthere's a lot of downtime, waiting for something to happen. But the\nthing about us is that we're just like you. We love to joke around,\nand talk about geekly stuff. Want to know what Monte really thinks\nabout your favorite rpg? What Jen's favorite action movie is, and\nwhy? You'll probably find that out and a lot more if you watch. \nFirst and foremost, though, we'll be\nthere to actually find some evidence. Each investigation will be an\nadventure with each own challenges and goals. And there will be\nsurprises and fun things. Best of all, through our website, you'll be\nable to provide feedback and share your own ideas for investigations,\nyour own experiences involving the paranormal, and your own views on\nthe geeky stuff we talk about. \nThis is all a new undertaking for each\nof us, but when you think about it, it makes sense. You know us for\nour geeky accomplishment, and what on Earth is geekier than this? We\nthank you in advance for your contributions and support. You guys are\nthe best.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Quern is a first person puzzle adventure with captivating story and beautiful graphics. The game is currently in early development by Zadbox Entertainment. Quern refreshes the genre with flexible gameplay and reuseable puzzle mechanics. The visuals and the music combine traditional and modern elements providing a unique mood for the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Quern is but a little fragment of the World Chain, but it has quite an important role. Civilisations rise and fall due to this world.“ \nAs huge fans of story-driven games and detailed narratives, we wrote and sketched the concepts of a complex and coherent world. The works of Jules Verne in particular, influenced us greatly. Our aim was to capture the mood and essence of his novels and combine that with magical, fantasy elements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis universe is a structured system of worlds all connected to each other. The player assumes the role of a person, who has been trapped in one of these worlds which is a mysterious island surrounded by oceans as far as the eye could see. He finds himself in front of an entrance to a deserted ancient city. \nThe player recieves guidance from two different sources, which are both mysterious in completely different ways. One of them is a scientist, who talks to the player through letters, which are factual, rational - written with a logical approach. The other one is an ancient spirit, who makes connection with us through visions, and gives us guidance about the spirituality of the island.\n\n \n\nThe player soon finds out that these two guides have conflicting opinions about the island’s mysteries. They both demand us to understand Quern, but while the professor wants us to experiment with the environment and manipulate it, the spirit asks us to observe and be a part of it, without physically changing anything. The letters we find contain direct instructions and answers, whereas the visions raise questions, so we find out the answers ourselves. It is up to the player to decide which guide they want to follow, but sooner or later, they must make a permanent choice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we created the story of the stranger (the player), we wrote a whole backstory for the island itself. There were three heroes of an ancient civilisation who have been trapped in Quern long before the stranger has. They managed to understand how the operating principles work in this world and experienced a whole new way of existence. Their presence here made great consequences in their home world. They left behind fragments and the wisdom of their culture in many different forms. Thousands of years after the three heroes managed to leave the island, an archaeologist came in search of their legacy. He knew about the unrealistic nature of the island and he came here with a clear purpose, to understand it. The professor tamed the elements of the island and learned to use them for his own purposes, his knowledge has grown more powerful than he has ever imagined. However, unexpected events happened in Quern not long before the stranger arrived. \n\nAs we delve deeper in the story, we find hints of the happenings of the past, and these aid us in understanding our role and importance in the story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATCH THE GAMEPLAY TRAILER IN HD  \nThe gameplay follows the main elements of classic puzzle adventure games. We can pick up many different objects and store them in our inventory where we can inspect them and interact with them. These objects all have colourful and varied purposes. We run into hints and clues that we will need later on to solve riddles or complete puzzles. At first, we face smaller, easier, independent challenges, and as we progress, the game starts to get more complex and unpredictable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS DIFFERENT? \nQuern is open world, meaning the players can freely explore and wander around the island. Putting an object in a slot and walking away is simply not our style. Of course we have keys opening gates, but in Quern most of the puzzle mechanics are reusable in some other way. As the story is progressing, we face more and more complicated challenges that might lead us back to an earlier puzzle, forcing us to re-imagine it with the extra items or knowledge we have gathered. This way the player needs to think about the game as a whole, not just as a series of individual puzzles. We also allow the player to mess with the game mechanics by not stopping them when the interaction is incorrect. The player has the chance to experience other outcomes which sometimes seem to be completely pointless. These results help the players find out how to get to the solution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAP SYSTEM \n Looking at the map provides the player with a better understanding of the place he is currently exploring. Different zones and locations are revealed on the map as the player wanders around the island. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTROLS \nDespite believing that FPS controls give the player the perfect freedom, we are working on another option for people who are more familiar with the classic, mouse-only controls. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make the game more immersive we wanted the players to be themselves instead of playing a role. One of our main concepts was to give no information about the look or the backstory of the main character. This way people can easily connect with the stranger regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. \nAs great fans of the MYST series, the visual style of these fantastic games have been our biggest influences. We aimed for a surreal mood to make the player curious as to what the rules of this world are, and urge them into diving deeper and deeper into its secrets.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further the surrealism, we designed Quern to be a world full of contrast, yet still maintaining aspects of realism. We have a warm, sandy island in the middle of an endless ocean covered with pine trees, which are originally native to mountains. The sky is full of rain clouds but it never rains, so the ground is dry and cracked. The buildings are clearly ancient with relatively modern, mechanic additions.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the puzzles get more challenging, completing them becomes even more visual and directly rewarding in addition to the progression made in the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Though the island itself is highly detailed and well processed, the menu and interface design is elegant and minimalist, which fits well with the realistic graphics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we started the development, we worked with the free version of Unity 4, but we recently transitioned to the brand new and more efficient Unity 5. This change gives our artist a new level of freedom to further improve Quern's graphics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are working on the English texts and voice over for now, but we plan to translate the game to at least three other languages: German , Spanish and Hungarian. \nFor now, we are developing the game for Windows , Mac and Linux but we hope to be able to reach PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well. \nWe are already testing Oculus Rift  with satisfying results and we are eager to work with it, and make Quern a more believable experience. \nThe game in it’s current state works perfectly with 4:3 , 16:9 and 21:9 aspect ratios and we are working on interface optimization for 4k to make it ready for future standards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all knew each other before we started working as a video game development team. We were a group of friends with completely different professions and interests, but one thing we all had in common, was our love for games. Soon we realised that our differences complement each other, and we started working together on a test project years before Quern. It started out merely as a hobby but we turned out to be an efficient team and we all really enjoyed working together. At the time we were all university students and we had no time to finish the project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n HOW DID QUERN START? \nQuern was originally a 3D artwork for our designer, Daniel’s dissertation. It was basically a non-interactive environment design demonstration for his thesis. People’s reactions to the project were far better than expected and they wanted to explore this yet unfinished world themselves. After getting his degree, Daniel started thinking about developing a game with the already created and beloved style and mood. Years have passed since the test project and we came together as a team again to create something bigger than any of us has ever done before. \nWHAT IS ZADBOX? \nWorking on video games is our dream, and we are eager to do this as a full time job. After we finish Quern, we would like to continue working together on other video games and media related projects as an official studio. For this reason we founded a company called Zadbox Entertainment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n The game has many different areas with their own individual moods and atmospheres. We wanted each zone to have its own unique music while still keeping the soundtrack consistent. One of the challenges was to find the right ambience for each area and to build interesting soundscapes around key scenes in the game.  \n\nThe music is an important factor in making the gameplay even more immersive, by having it react to interactions made by the player. The soundtrack of Quern works well on its own but we had to make sure it also works as background music. It’s very atmospheric with a combination of textural sounds and traditional instruments with the addition of unique musical elements for each scene. \n\n\n\n\n .soundcloud .card {\n max-height: 250px;\n }\n .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {\n height: 220px;\n }\n .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {\n height: unset;\n }\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs indie game developers we don’t have a publisher to cover the expenses that come with creating a video game. This is our first major game and we would like to get feedback from as many sources as possible. Kickstarter is the best way to achieve this. Supporting us here gives us immediate feedback about the possible success of the game. \n\nOur biggest hope is to get enough support to fund the game so we can dedicate all of our time to the project.The money goal we set would allow us to create Quern the way we imagined it. \nWHERE WILL THE MONEY GO? \nWe dedicated most of our free time throughout the last year for the development of the game. We need your support so we can focus on Quern above anything else and invest all of our time and energy into the game. We already have plans we can work with although the game’s quality, length and the amount of details all depend on the money we can invest into the development. \nBesides that, there is a fair amount of money we would like to spend on recording the voice over. We’ve already got in contact with a brilliant voice actor, Michael Morris, who we think is the perfect match for the narration of Quern. We talked to him about the game and our vision and he supported us by recording the narration for our trailer. We knew we needed to work with him at the very moment we first heard his amazing voice. \nFinally there are the expenses we simply cannot avoid. Fees for the services we use, prices of the software we need to buy, renting a workplace for us, paying taxes and managing our company. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur money goal would allow us to finish Quern but we have further plans to improve the quality of the game and to give you more content. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe highly appreciate any support you can give us! Here are a few perks you can choose from when deciding on backing the project. The game will be DRM FREE. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, go to the “manage” section on the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge by the amount your desired add-on costs. (Keep in mind you can add multiple add-ons to your pledge.) These add-ons allow you to add individual items to your rewards. To be able to purchase add-ons however, you need to pledge a certain amount first. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease pledge £10 (£8 for early birds) - ‘Digital copy of the game’ or more to get access to the following add-ons: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand please pledge £40 - ‘Hard copy of the game’ or more to get access to the following add-ons: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of our Kickstarter campaign we will contact you to specify your add-on choices. \n\n \n Risks and challenges Making a video game is something we have always wanted to do so we started working on Quern out of passion. The more time we spend on it, the more we realise creating a video game is a lot more difficult and challenging than we had imagined. There are many risks involved, some of which we can’t necessarily deal with without money.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for us as a newly founded company is that we have a very limited budget. We don’t have a portfolio in game development to show people who we are, so we can only hope that our game itself is enough to get the community’s support.\n\nAnd for the same reason, there is a chance that the game won’t find its audience on Steam Greenlight. This would put us in a very difficult situation, as we would have to come up with a different solution to release the game and make it commercially available.\n\nAs well as having all the risks of the development itself, there could also be personal risks.\nThere are only four of us in our group, so if anything happens to any of us, the whole development might need to shut down, until they are able to get back to work. Since all four of us are great friends, it would be impossible to find a perfect replacement for anyone in the project. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about personal issues, apart from taking care of ourselves.\n\nThere are also technical difficulties that come with working with certain software. Ever since we started adding in puzzles and complex game mechanics, we’ve faced many different technical issues. So far we have managed to overcome all of them, but it is possible that one day we’ll find an issue that we simply can’t fix without having to hire someone with a lot more experience than we have.

Nabil, from Portugal, Karim, from South Korea, and Anise from Australia. Since there is a certain magic that exists only when creative individuals with a unified vision come together in the same physical space - we will come together in August, to finalize the recording process of the album! And in early October we will come together again to film the music video! Recording, mixing, mastering, CD design/printing, and video production will be carried out by industry professionals. We will be producing and recording this album in a world class recording studio in Europe. \n\nFrom Nabil and Karim, you can expect some similarities to their previous two albums of Baha’i inspired songs and from Anise K, you can expect excellence in musicality, production, and his strong ability to bring cultural sounds together as one. This album will be an amalgamation and fusion of all three contributors. Nabil plays guitar, sings and produces, Karim raps, does beatboxing and produces, and Anise plays piano and produces. All three of us are hyped, excited, stoked, thrilled and humbled by the prospects of this conceptual album and music video becoming a reality! We are calling on your support to help us make this happen by doing one or all of the following steps:  1)  Make a financial pledge on this page right now;  2)  Tell your friends, family, and colleagues about our project;  3)  Repeat steps 1 and 2!   These CDs will make for fantastic gifts, the songs will make for great conversation starters to have in your car or on your phone, and the music video will be a powerful online tool for all to share. These will be top-notch pop/hip hop/r&b sounding songs infused with Baha’i quotes, prayers and reflections.  Our process as three different creative minds so far has been one of consultation, cooperation, and true expression - all with an undertone of love, respect, and understanding. We truly want to offer the best of each of our abilities to this project. With this year being so special for every Baha’i to offer unique acts of service we are inspired to offer our best in the form of music that is infused with Baha’u’llah’s Words.  This is the breakdown of our costs:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our timeline:  MAY - Initial Conversations JUNE - Planning / Consultations JULY - Kickstarter Campaign / Spiritual Preparation / Songwriting AUGUST - Travel / Recording / Production SEPTEMBER - Mixing / Mastering / Printing OCTOBER - Digital Download Available / Professional Music Video shoot NOVEMBER - CD Shipping / Reward Fulfillment  All three of us thank you for taking your time to view our project, and we thank you in advance for bringing our music to the world!  Respect and love,  Nabil, Karim, Anise  Some of our previous works: \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground on Nabil & Karim : In 2009, two young men set out on a mission to create music. Music for the next generation. Music, that was directly inspired by and included the Sacred Writings of the Baha’i Faith. Since that time, these two guys (Nabil and Karim) have recorded two albums and travelled to many Baha’i communities and conferences across North America. They have visited many junior youth camps and other various community celebrations and holy day gatherings. Their first album can now be found on all major music sites...and soon their second one as well! \n\n\n\n\n Background on Anise K : Anise Arsalon Khoshmashrab (born February 20, 1985) is a International recording artist, record producer, and songwriter known by his stage name Anise K.

Now don't get us wrong, we've tried to put out a self-produced album, but setting your own vocal level without an extra set of ears can be problematic. We've got a well-worn demo CD floating around out there somewhere. If you look hard enough you're sure to find a copy or two decorating someone's rear-view mirror... But in all seriousness, this CD project is our life for the next couple of months. It is tentatively labeled \"Rough Cut and Duty Free\", with \"Sot Salvation\" and \"Saints and Sinners\" also in contention for the album title. We have a total of 17 tracks recorded thanks to our friend Jud Caswell of \"Frog Hollow Studio\" in Brunswick, Maine. We will be returning to the studio on May 11th to record some last minute songs and to put a bit of polish on the tracks. You can check out the studio here: https://www.facebook.com/FrogHollowStudio Jon and Kate Mess will be our graphic designers.

Not only that but we are meeting with our graphic designers Kate and Jon Mess this Sunday (5/26) to go over some ideas! Even though we're working with professionals, we're still looking to our fans and asking them to send us their pictures and ideas. If you have a crazy kooky idea for album art jot it down, take a picture of it, and email it to us! No creativity will be turned away! This Kickstarter will completely fund the CD production costs. We donated all of our St. Paddy's day gig money to pay for the cost of the recording and mixing, and we just need your help to get it out into the world! Our tentative release date is June 17th, with a solid release date of July 1st. The CD's will be packaged in 100% recycled cardboard packs that will have a barcode so that they can be purchased in your local CD stores. The tracks for the album will be available for online purchase via CD Baby, Amazon, and ITunes. If you are a fan, and you love our music as much as we do, please help us out... Thank-you. -April, Oren, and Brian... AHSB Risks and challenges The only possible set-back that we can see would be if any of our tracks have volume issues during the mastering process. In the event that this happens, production could be pushed back while we re-record those tracks. Even so, we don't anticipate a delay of more than one month.

This basically cuts our\ncosts by one-half in this area.\nI don’t over-press. We learned this lesson the hard way. Generally, we press\n2,000 copies only in our first wave. \nFor the most part, the CHB plays on its own records. Very little spent on\noutside players.\nWhat are the expenses?\n1) Studio time\n2) Studio engineering\n3) Musicians\n4) Graphics\n5) Photography\n6) Printing and pressing of CDs (approx $2500)\n7) Shipping/promo costs PROGRESS: Once\nagain, some of the pre-production work has already been done. Some of the\nfunding we can, as on every project, provide ourselves.\nInitial tracks have been produced on the\nfollowing songs: 1) Over the Hill and Down the Road \n2) The Death of A Honky-Tonk Fool\n3) Pretty Little Lies 4) Blues for the Big State\n5) The Company of Strangers\n6) While the Band Plays \"Every Time We Say Goodbye\"\n7) (Real Love is) A Hard Act To Follow\n8) Life as You Want It\n9) Your Faith in Me\n10) She's Like Brown Sugar \n11) The One You Still Love\n12) Cemetery Road 13) Instrumental 14) Coming Down (After Being in Love) We have been\nperforming Pretty Little Lies, Over the Hill and Down the Road and Blues for the Big State to an\noverwhelmingly positive response for months. We think this will be an excellent\nCD. ANY funds we\nreceive above our pledge goal will be used to produce this CD. All money will\nbe accounted for. thanks for\nstopping by, Cornell Hurd Risks and challenges Risks and challenges?\n\nBy participating, you've entered SHOW BIZ, as tough a business as exists on the planet.

The writing is ongoing and it will happen, but I want this product to be enjoyable and really pop .  To do that, we need artwork.  I want to pay artists a fair price and that's where this comes in.  I could finish writing this up all plain and boring, but this is the chance to get some great art into the game's pages and support other small-time creators like myself. \nDo it because you love art. \nDo it because you love robots. \nDo it because you love the dodecahedron. \n International Backers Sadly, shipping things further away costs more money.  If you back at a tier that gets you physical products in the mail, please add the $6 for backers in Canada and $12 for backers in all other non-US locations to cover the extra cost.  Thank you.

    "textDescription": "Story Hey there!  Here's the deal: For the past ten months, bit by bit, I've been working on recording a six song EP with the amazing producer/composer/sound mastermind Jacob Goldman. The songs are there! The sounds are there! The album is almost there! I have spent days and days and dollars and dollars to get this far, but I need your help in order to make this something you can hold in your hands and put in your ears. Mastering and printings costs add up to over $2500, and without your help, this album won't see the bright light of the good day. I would really appreciate any $$ you can offer, and in exchange I promise you a beautiful record, to hear and to hold. Here's the story: WINTER PART I: About three years ago I sat down at the desk in my dorm room, a little bit heartsick, either because of a boy or because of the paper I hadn't yet written that night, and wrote my first song, \"I Wish I Were a Bird.\" A year later I recorded my debut full-length album, No Town, with Colorado musician and producer Eric Shiveley. Thanks to a strange pizza fate and a German guardian angel named Lars, I took my debut album with me to Europe, where I played in Germany, Spain, and Portugal, and then across the Western U.S., touring across eleven states and driving three thousand miles alone in a Buick LeSabre. Whew! I took a lot of naps in parks that summer. WINTER PART II: Last December I met producer/composer Jacob Goldman at a house show in New Haven. I rescued him from a fire and then asked if he'd help me record my next album. \"Sure,\" he said, because what else can you say to someone who has just saved your life, or at least your turtleneck sweater. \"Great,\" I said. \"I have a million songs ready to go.\" I didn't, in fact, have a million songs. I only had one or two, and I spent a week that month in my childhood home in Colorado writing the rest. Sometimes I got frustrated and took a walk in the snow (often it took hours to regain feeling in my legs post snow-walk). Sometimes I ate enchiladas. I returned to New Haven in January and Jake and I camped out in a third floor studio for three weeks to record the six songs I'd just written. We wore hats. I was always late. We brought in our friends to play their fancy instruments (a handmade violin! a mint and bubble gum pink electric guitar!). We wondered what it would be like if it were warm enough to go outside to play basketball. The end of January came quickly, and recording had to take a pause while \"real life\" pulled us back into its onerous tides. SUMMER: After a six month studio hiatus, a life across the Atlantic, a college diploma, and a long email chain with the subject line \"BIG PLAANS!\" we returned to the third floor to finish recording and mixing the album. It didn't last long. We were again interrupted, this time by the long days of summer and a three week tour of the southeast. We packed up my guitar, Jake's mini drum kit, and some trail mix from the fancy local food coop, and headed south. We played for barefooted teenagers, wine drunk psychiatrists, and a rotting porch watermelon. We loved it, and we ate many hamburgers along the way. FALL: We returned to the northeast, summer ended, though we didn't know when, exactly, and Jake finished mixing the album. It's almost winter, now, and it's time to get these six songs out into the world before they collect too much digital dust somewhere in a Brooklyn apartment. They are peeking out from a blanket of binary waiting for you launch them into the next stage of their little lives! WINTER PART III: ? ? ? ? !! ? ?!?!?!? It's coming. I hope you will be a part of it. Please, have Winter in Mind. ! xo Laurelin Risks and challenges I am very close to finishing this album - Songs - check! Artwork - check! - and with your generous support I will be able to fund the final steps. \n\nHere's what's next!\n1. Songs will be sent off to be mastered!\n2. Stumptown Printers will print beautiful sleeves to house these sounds.\n3. I will send the EP and any other rewards your way. \n\nWhile I am hoping to release the album by the end of November, mastering and printing could potentially take additional time as I work with others to finalize audio and art and wait for the good 'ol pony express to ship the EP to me (and then to you!) I want to get this to you as soon as possible but please keep these things in mind as you eagerly await Winter. Thanks! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Thanks to \nyour speedy support, everyone will not only get the perks promised to \nthem, but a delicious new album for your ears as well!! I'm beyond \nthrilled that Animal Love is actually going to become a reality, and \nthat we can start setting cogs in motion for its creation now that we \nhave a budget. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU - I really do have the most\n amazing fans ever. Now here's the fun part - Many\n of you have been asking if you can still donate now that the project \nhas reached its goal. The answer is a resounding YES! I set the project \nlength at 30 days, so we have until July 15 to spread the word and shoot\n for the moon, the stars, infinity and beyond! The more money we raise \nfor the album, the better we can make it and the more things we can do \nconcerning it (a national/international tour? a music video? five music \nvideos? absurd merch like CK frisbees and kitchenware?) So I challenge \nyou, world -  If we raise $30,000, you will get two things. 1)\n Everyone who donates $15 or more will get a secret link to an exclusive\n director's commentary cut of all of my music videos directed by my \nfantastic sister Liann Kaye (Skin and Bones, Magnolia Wine, Dress and \nTie, and Human) - she can explain her artistic vision behind each of \nthem (why cardboard props? Why have me act as both the wife and the \ntreacherous vixen?), tell funny stories of Darren and I on set, and \nreveal other secrets of her young genius. I might make an appearance, \ntoo! She will even answer questions submitted by YOU about the videos \nand anything else you've ever wanted to know about being an indie \nfilmmaker working with some of America's brightest talent!!  2)\n In the most literal display of commitment to the making of Animal Love,\n I will film a ridiculous video of myself performing a song of my \nchoosing dressed in a gorilla suit in Times Square with Joe Moses. Yes. I will do it for art.LASTLYYYYY......... I\n have recently obtained a very special piece of memorabilia for some \nlucky person's collection - as an additional perk for $2000, I am \nthrowing into the ring my personal pair of Darren Criss pink sunglasses \nthat he gave me last summer, which is signed by the both of us and that I\n have worn at many a show. (getting it gets you everything above except \nthe house concert, dresses, guitar and cardigan). It also has magical \npowers to turn you into a genie, so... I love you all and I'm so\n proud of us! Please keep spreading the word like it's your job and \nlet's make this record one for the books! BIG BIG LOVE xoxoCHARLENE ------------ UPDATE (6/17/11) - Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great joy to announce that the red dress I wore in the Dress and \nTie video and the blue cardigan have been scooped up by some lucky fans \nand those perks are now SOLD OUT!!! But you can still get the white \ndress I wore in the Human music video (which drops in a couple weeks, so\n get excited) and/or my black electric hollowbody guitar I played in the\n Mad Tom of Bedlam video. THANKS to all who have pledged and let's keep it going! ROCK! \n------ORIGINAL POST--------- Dear fans and supporters, You've all been incredible with your support of me and my music over the past few years, and so many of you have asked when I plan to release my next full-length record. It's been almost 3 years since my debut album dropped, and I'm happy to say that I'm FINALLY ready to start work on my sophomore effort. I've got a brand new batch of songs that carries some of my most ambitious and inspired work to date, and I'm dying to get them into your hands - but to do so, I need your help. I've been doing everything myself for as long as I've been making music - the right label just hasn't presented itself yet - but things as an indie haven't been too shabby either. This past year I shot a couple of big-budget music videos, opened for Big Boi and Minus the Bear, went to the Grammys to promote my single \"Dress and Tie\" with Darren Criss, played CMJ and SXSW festivals, had my music on MTVU and licensed by NBC's Chuck, toured the country and made thousands of new fans, all without a label. But alas, records are expensive, and booking studio time, paying musicians, mixing/mastering, packaging, and promotion - still requires impossible amounts of money for people in my position. After crunching numbers, we decided that $20,000 is a wonderful starting point to make this record a reality. If we surpass that, we can do tons more stuff like pay for a tour, even more music videos, and lots of other stuff for the album to be a success! I'll be working with my dear friend and bandmate Tomek Miernowski at the helm as co-producer & engineer, and I have a slew of talented musicians and friends on board for collaborations and guest appearances from all your favorite characters. I hope you'll help me make this record! If you do, you can get a ton of awesome stuff in return, like you can come sing onstage with me at a concert, hang out at the studio while we're making the record, get one of my guitars, and more! Thank you all so much for listening and reading. I love you all.

    "textDescription": "Story Shakewell is a new “Americlectic” restaurant and bar with its roots in Mediterranean cuisine. Shakewell's vibrant and social bar will be the center of the restaurant, where our guests will meet to share food and drink from our affordable, seasonal cocktail menu. Diners looking for great food in a warm, fun atmosphere with a continuously changing menu will find it in our beautiful Oakland restaurant. \n\n\nalbondigas con sofrito \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nroasted spaghetti squash, serrano ham, sherry wine \n \n\n \n\n\nShakewell will be a\ncasual restaurant in Oakland's quickly growing Lakeshore neighborhood. The\nrestaurant will be an open and airy sixty-seat dining room with a long,\ncomfortable sixteen-seat bar where you can sit before you are seated at a table\nor dine at with one of our fantastic bartenders. \n\n\n\n\nmonterey sardine toast \n \n\n \n\nThe menu will be\nfilled with our favorites from Mediterranean countries like Spain, Turkey, and\nNorth Africa, with our own special twists, like salt cod and spring garlic\nfritters, calamari spiced chick pea salad, or manila clams with jamón ibérico\nand coco beans. We’ll also offer a variety of rice dishes (kinda like\npaella), harissa-rubbed lamb kebabs, and chili chocolate coffee braised beef.\nOur objective is to use the freshest ingredients we can get our hands on\nbecause we know that's what makes this type of food delicious. It's easy—using fresh\ningredients with simple preparations lets the ingredients speak for themselves.\nOur small plates menu will also include tapas-style dishes, seasonal salads,\nand, of course, Tim’s famous desserts. Every dish is fresh, healthy,\nhouse-made, and prepared daily. \n\n\n\n\nfisherman's stew \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe bar menu, like the food\nmenu, features seasonal farmers’ market ingredients along with local beers,\nwines from Europe, and, of course, gems from California’s wineries. We want to\nhave wine on tap so that you can enjoy a local wine (or two!) for an affordable\nprice. The bar and the kitchen are the focal points of the restaurant and will\nwork seamlessly to provide daily drink and food specials using the best\ningredients.     \n\n\nwild snapper, sweet peas, baby radish,flowers \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\ngreen garlic, salt cod fritters \n \n\n \n\nShakewell\nprovides guests with-high quality service in a friendly and casual environment.\nWe want our guests to come to Shakewell two or three times a week because they\nare treated like family. \n\n\n\n\nroasted peach tart \n \n\n \n\n\nTo turn Shakewell into the restaurant we've dreamed of and the one we\nknow you will love, we need to make some changes. It needs a new bar, a new\nfloor, tables, and chairs, and the facade needs to be redone. The existing bar\nis small, and because we are planning a fantastic cocktail program, we want the\nsize and quality of the bar to equal that of the wine and cocktails. The existing\nfloor is old carpet, and that just won't do for the beautiful restaurant we\nwant to create. Things have been changing in restaurants, from the way people\nexpect to eat and be served to the place where it all happens, and we want to\nbe at the forefront of those changes. We aren't planning anything fancy, but we\nknow that if we are going to be successful, Shakewell needs an update. We are\ndoing this on a tight budget, but we still need your help!  \n*Many thanks are in order for putting this campaign together, including Aaron Delman (aaron.delman@gmail.com) for his videographer skills, Sara Delman for her Production and editing skills,  and Tessa Swigart for her keen eye thank you! \n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The biggest Risk we are facing is securing the location, if we do not raise enough funding by August 26, 2013, we will loose the space and have to begin looking all over again. We love the space and it has tremendous potential, it will be a success with your help.\n\nOne of the challenges for Shakewell will be maintaining a strong and continually developing relationship with the local community whilst running a busy restaurant. We hope by ensuring that this is an integral part of our business plan from the start this relationship will grow and remain a main focus for ourselves and our restaurant family.\n\nRestaurants have a history of failure which can be scary but we think those failures often happen because of mismanagement, unrealistic financial goals and lack of work ethic. We want to take on this challenge because we're opening this restaurant for all the right reasons. We're not looking to hit it big, we want to create a family in our restaurant--a family that is made up of staff, purveyors and suppliers and of course, our guests. We are both extremely competent people with lots of experience with restaurant financials, food costs, and just about everything else that you need to run a restaurant the right way. It is not an easy life but we love what we do and we work hard to make everything we do great. This restaurant will be our home we share with you! \n\nAnother challenge in opening Shakewell Bar and Kitchen is the economy. We are very hopeful with the direction the economy is going these days, but there are still valid fears that we aren't in the clear yet. However, we've seen that historically, dips in the general economy have less impact on neighborhood restaurants than they do on most other segments of the economy. To some degree this is because food, regardless of whether it is from the grocery or a restaurant is a fundamental necessity of life and consumers spend accordingly. In addition, levels and price points found in the industry allow for accommodation of changing financial circumstances, making it possible for restaurant businesses to succeed in a variety of economic climates. The prices at Shakewell will be very competitive and will allow for a diverse group of diners.\n\nLastly, Shakewell will likely have challenges during the remodel, with permits or will it be plumbing we don't know but we will deal with each challenge head-on so we can bring this great restaurant to life!

    "textDescription": "Story Project Summary The Lonely Himalayas \nis a cinematic effort to document the unprecedented socio-ecological changes\noccurring throughout the Kumaon region of the Himalayas.The acceleration of urban migration, coupled\nwith the ravages of climate change, have left many Kumaoni villages abandoned, their landscapes irrevocably altered.  By\ninvolving the youth of West Binsar Valley in filming this documentary, they are\ngiven an opportunity to learn a professional skill while examining their\ncultural heritage. \n\n\nNanda Kot (6,861 m), Kumaon Himalayas \n \n\n \nProject Description A mere stone’s throw from the Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary lays the sleepy village of Mayoli. If you squint hard enough, you can see the Nanda Devi Himalayan range from the ridgeline, often obscured from the wreath of pollution generated from the swelling urban centers at the base. A legion of pine trees dutifully protects the aesthetics of the hillside. Under starlight, the leopards howl. Come midday, wild boars terrorize ayurvedic garden beds. The Kumaon region of the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India is unparalleled in its untrammeled access to the Himalayas. Within Kumaon, the Western Binsar Valley is renowned for its awe-inspiring solace and biological diversity. However, what may seem like a veritable paradise to foreigners feels like a prison to a younger generation tantalized by images of Bollywood excess, hyper-connectivity to digital surrealities, and the plethora of both professional and educational opportunities in urban settings.  \n\n\nKumaoni women farming in Binsar Valley \n \n\n \n“My mother does farming and raises cattle. I know how to do this work because I have seen it from childhood. In the future, I don’t want to do this work. I want to get out of this place.” --Deepa Kandpal, Media Workshop Participant  In search of a life quite different from their parents’, Binsar Valley youth abandon their agrarian villages and crowd the over-burdened infrastructure of India’s mega-cities. Upon urban migration, vital cultural components are lost, including traditions, regional-specific farming methods, folk songs, handicrafts, herbal medicines, even languages. As politicians unleash free market economic policies and succumb to neoliberal development schemes with multilateral institutions, India is globalizing at breakneck speed.\nDetermined to stem the tide of socio-ecological change, fledgling NGO the Himalayan Ethno Botanic Garden Society (HEBGS) began working with village youth to reexamine their cultural identities. Utilizing the 15 years of documentary film making experience, HEBGS founders Pankaj Bhakuni and Sachin Bisht began a Media Workshop to teach basic film making and editing skills to Binsar Valley adolescents. Throughout the process, the teens rediscovered the traditions of their ancestors they had heretofore spurned. \n The Film \nTwo Kumaoni friends leave the hustle and bustle of Delhi to return to their\nhomeland in order to protect remote Himalayan villages.  Two American backpackers stumble upon this\nmission while in country, become friends with them and volunteer at their\ncampsite.  While sipping tea over a\ncampfire, the four decide to make this documentary. \n\n\nMedia Workshop with Binsar Valley youth \n \n\n \nThis film will contain several sequences filmed by Binsar\nValley youth who participate in a media workshop.  Their interviews of village elders will\nprovide a unique perspective of a generation at a crossroads.  Layered on top of these components are\nexpansive investigations of environmental changes occurring in Kumaon, such as\nbiodiversity loss, topsoil degradation, forest succession, climate change,\ninvasive species, glacial melt, and water scarcity.  Alongside urban migration, other sociological\nelements discussed in the film are poverty, political economy, educational\ndisparity, separation anxiety, and public health concerns. The Facts Sociological change: A demographic\ntransition is occurring in India on a vast scale.  As the middle class expands, consumer\nspending and consumption increases. This inevitably causes a strain in urban\ninfrastructure, such as roads, sewage systems, building, and electricity.  As India modernizes, urban migration is\naccelerating from villages like those in Binsar Valley.  As disparities in wealth continue to expand\nat alarming rates, many urban and seasonal migrants are often relegated to\nhumble living quarters or makeshift dwellings in slums, a critical social\njustice issue.  Mass urbanization is\noccurring for many reasons, among them a dearth of employment opportunities in\nrural settings, chain migration to unite with family members, and a desire for\nbetter educational opportunities.  During\nthis process, migrants are often subsumed into a larger globalized culture, as\ntheir ancestral culture often becomes diluted. Ecological change:   Due to climate change, the average temperature of the Himalayas is warming at a\nfaster rate than the global average rate. \nTemperature increases are greater during the autumn and winter seasons\nwith faster warming happening at higher altitudes.  Over 67% of the Himalayan glaciers have\nretreated.  Climate change will also increase the spread of vector-borne diseases (i.e. Malaria, Dengue Fever, Lyme disease, Bartonellosis, etc.) throughout the Kumaon region, thereby posing an increasingly grave human health risk for vulnerable populations. Biodiversity is declining\nthroughout Uttarakhand due to these climatic changes.  In Binsar Valley, traditional broadleaf forests are transitioning to pine forests.  Many endemic species of ayurvedic herbal plants that have been used in medicines for thousands of years are no longer being cultivated, due to the insistence of farmers to prioritize cash crops for export.  Biodiversity\nloss throughout Kumaon will likely affect rural populations, as their\nlivelihoods are almost exclusively dependent on natural resources. Also, soil degradation and erosion are occurring at an alarming rate due to a lack of regeneration of topsoil and over-abundant nutrient loading in agriculture.  Agricultural\nvulnerability to climatic shifts has been documented in the Kumaon region, in\nparticular that of wheat and rice.  These\nshifts will likely exacerbate issues of food insecurity in the region.  Flash flooding has been occurring more\nfrequently throughout Uttarakhand, including a dangerous episode in the fall of\n2013, claiming over 5,700 lives. \n\n\nTraditional Kumaoni house \n \n\n \nThe Funds This\nfilm has been a passion project for everyone on our team, and now we need your\npassion and support to bring awareness to this critical issue.  Our fundraising goal is $3,000. Here are some estimates on where the money will be spent: \n$1,250: Film-making\n equipment (camera, lighting, memory cards, video editing software, etc.)\n \n $1,000: Food and lodging for The Lonely Himalayas crew\n when traveling to various parts of the Himalayas \n \n $500:  Marketing\n the film in the USA through promotional materials (fliers, posters, trailers), film screenings, website design, etc.  This will be accomplished in Chicago. \n $250:  Generation of donor gifts, including the\n packaging costs.  \n \n The above-mentioned fundraising goal is what we consider to\nbe “bare bones.”  In fact, it does not\neven include transportation costs (plane, train, bus, and the ever-exciting\nrickshaw).  However, every additional\ndollar will make this documentary even better, while preventing the four of us\nfrom going broke during the film-making process! \n;)  It is important for us to mention that Kickstarter has an \"all or nothing\" funding model. Thus, until our film is 100% funded, no deductions of your pledged donations will be made from your account. Even if our film reaches 99% on our last day of fundraising, you will not be charged one penny, nor will we receive one penny. This gives us considerable pressure to fundraise within 30 days, but gives you the security of only donating to legitimate projects! \n\n\nApricot blossoms in Binsar Valley \n \n\n \nStretch Goal Our stretch goal is $5,000.  The additional funds will go towards making\nthe film the best it can be and will allow us to film in more remote areas\nwhich may require additional transportation, lodging and food costs.  Also, with additional funding, we can put\nmore efforts into getting it out to the largest audience possible as well as\nentering our film into various film festivals.   We believe this film to be of utmost importance to document\nthe ancient traditions of a culture at a crossroads.  With your help, we can bring awareness to\nthis issue as well as continue to engage the Binsar Valley youth through film.

Risks and challenges Every worthwhile experience will have obstacles to hurdle. While it is difficult to anticipate what these obstacles will be, we are committed to overcoming them. Production delays are a slight possibility, given the sporadic electricity and internet in Binsar Valley, especially during winter and monsoon seasons. However, this is unlikely to throw off the progress of this film more than a few weeks, as most editing will be done from larger cities nearby with more reliable infrastructure. \n\nPerhaps the largest obstacle we will face is the lack of film financing, which will ensure this film will not be made, which is why we’re launching this Kickstarter initiative! Luckily, Kickstarter has a forum for us to communicate with our contributors for any updates. We plan to utilize this forum to maintain an open line of communication with all our contributors. Collaborator mishaps may occur, although all members of The Lonely Himalayas crew are committed to the production of this film. The inception of this film grew through the spirit of volunteerism and love for nature. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Carnival Arts Exhibit at Miami International Airport  The Carnival Arts crew is putting on a major exhibit that will be seen by thousands of people in an art gallery at the Miami International Airport. To do this, we need to prepare for exhibit dozens of masks, costumes, and videos we've made over the past six years. We are also creating new work to hang from the high ceiling above the exhibit: 10 new 12-foot banners featuring 10 different carnival traditions and 3 GIANT carnival costumes.  \n\n\nCarnival Arts Workshop 2008 \n \n\n \n\n\nWhat is Carnival Arts? : For the past six years, dozens of Miami's best artists have collaborated with teens at the Miami Bridge youth crisis shelter. Through a series of ongoing workshops, these young artists learn traditional carnival arts of dancing, drumming, and maskmaking. They've put on dozens of performances from 10 carnival traditoins, created hundreds of masks, and even produced two short, Caribbean-themed films. Now it's time to share this work with the world -- or at least thousands of passengers in the Miami International Airport -- in a major exhibit with some major new pieces.  \n\n\nSetting a plaster cast on a young artist \n \n\n \n\nWhy Carnival Arts? Carnival in the Caribbean and Latin America is a time of celebration. That’s in spite of the violent history of these beautiful lands beginning with slavery and colonialism right up to political upheaval and poverty today. Carnival is a way of celebrating life in a time of crisis. That’s why Carnival Artists collaborate with young people at the Miami Bridge  youth crisis shelter.  In the carnival tradition, these young artists make masks and costumes that at once hide their identity and reveal how they feel about themselves and their world. They learn dance and drumming styles associated with different countries, from Cuba, Trinidad, and Haiti to Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Over the past six years, dozens of artists have taught elements of these traditions to hundreds of youth in crisis. Together, we’ve even made two films with stories taken from Caribbean history and Carnival lore. Now we will share this work with thousands of travelers passing through the Miami International Airport in February, March, and April. \n\n\n\nmia galleries at Miami International Airport : The Miami International Airport has one of the richest arts programs of any airport in the United States. The airport is home to dozens of permanent works of public art, as well as five galleries that showcase fine arts. The Carnival Arts exhibit will be held in the South Terminal Gallery, which is typically reserved for handcrafts from around the world – such as women’s basketweaving  in Rwanda and Brazilian design projects using recycled materials. The South Terminal Gallery holds six glass cases for exhibiting the masks, three large walls for photographs, video, and text, a large platform that will hold mannequins with costumes, and five overhead hangers for brand new banners and three giant carnival costumes. Giant Costumes! \n\n\nCarnival Artist poses with our first banner \n \n\n \n\nWhy We Need Your $$: We need your money to buy and build special materials for mounting masks and displaying costumes. We need your money to create the hanging banners and giant carnival costumes that will hang above the exhibit. We need your money to transform the platform in the exhibit space into a carroza, a carnival float, like the elaborate floats used in carnival parades in Barranquilla, Colombia. Last, but not least, we need your money to pay for dancing and drumming workshops for the teens in the shelter right now so that they will be able to perform at the exhibit's opening and closing receptions. Thank you so much for helping Carnival Artists share their work with the world! \n\n\nMaterials for a maskmaking workshop \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges The Carnival Arts exhibit at mia galleries has a firm deadline: the show must be up by February 7 and down soon after April 14. Otherwise, we miss or chance. And mia galleries has a big empty gallery for two months. That can't happen!\n\nWe have lots of volunteers ready to help build the materials and mount the exhibit. We have a wonderful group of professional artists ready to collaborate with the young artists in the shelter to make the new, giant elements for the exhibit. We can make this happen. \n\nWe've had plenty of mishaps over the past six years -- as you can imagine: All of our young artists are already in the midst of a terrible crisis! But with your help, we will overcome them all. That's what Carnival Arts is all about: celebrating life in a time of crisis. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

We're The Unassisted.  We're a fledgling band from Manchester in England and have been around for about 8 months now.  We feel we're making a good name for ourselves and have grown a great fan base in Manchester and around the globe.  We are being played regularly on local and international radio stations from Salford and Wigan to New York and Canada. The reason we're starting this project is to demonstrate what we can do on a more professional platform (to date all our tracks have been recorded at our homes with minimal production).  Having achieved so much in such a short time we know we can really push to a higher level with time in a true recording studio with a professional producer. We are all about our fans.  We love the effort they put in to help promote us, and we genuinely spend time tweeting, emailing, drinking and singing karaoke with them :)  In recording this EP we are building a platform for our fans to say \"We are part of The Unassisted and we helped make this record\", and we can really give back some of the support you guys give us day in day out.  We aim to record a 4 track EP consisting of the following tracks  1. https://soundcloud.com/unassisted/hands-dance-hands 2. https://soundcloud.com/unassisted/everything-1 3.https://soundcloud.com/unassisted/revolution 4.https://soundcloud.com/unassisted/alone-firestationsessions This will be distributed through the usual channels and also hard copies will be made.  If you haven't seen or heard us before we have plenty of content online from reviews to gig footage here are some links -  \n\n\nReviews and Interviews-  http://onefourzeroplus.blogspot.de/2013/10/the-unassisted-revolution.html?m=0 http://livingindielife.com/2013/07/13/the-unassisted/ http://realsoundsok.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/the-unassisted-q.html http://carpecarmina.blogspot.co.uk/ If you do like or even love our music a contribution would mean the world to us and we pledge to make an outstanding EP that we can all be proud of.  Risks and challenges The risks surrounding this project are the basics! studio being destroyed through a natural disaster or a death of a band member :) \n\nWe are accomplished musicians and there will be no issue on delivering the performance in studio and we have a great studio and producer lined up to help us create our vision. There may be a delay, if for example we are not entirely happy with the mix of the tracks, or if there is a hold up with the CD manufacturer. However, these thing can present a delay of weeks, at worst maybe a month.

With the money we raise from our Kickstarter, we plan to pay our initial start up costs, which include membership dues to the national organization.  We will also begin to invest in field trips like a backstage tour of Disneyland, a theatre college tour for our seniors, and the national USITT conference in Ohio this Spring. We have the potential to become an awesome organization dedicated to community support, but we can only do it with your help. Risks and challenges After our initial start up, we will continue to need sources of funding for producing events and shows and paying for the many field trips we're planning. While many of these expenses may be paid for by the students involved, we're hoping to host events to subsidize these costs and it is possible we will be unable to raise the necessary ongoing funds.\n\nIn the event we are unable to support field trips and internal functions, we will continue to reach out externally through community service projects and doing what we can to support local theatre companies.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its heart, SINS is a narrative role-playing game,\nspecifically focused on telling the stories of powerful\nentities known as Nemissaries - reborn individuals back from the dead with a wealth of mysterious powers, who have risen once more to fight an eldritch hive-mind of the undying, known as the Brood, in the post-apocalyptic ruins of a 22nd Century Earth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all its high-octane combat and supernatural forces, SINS is a cinematic game about choice, morality and the consequences which come from wielding great and terrible power in a world desperate for heroes and leaders. It’s also about embarking on life-changing adventures, battling supernatural horrors, and often, simply surviving life in an unforgiving world fraught with danger, where even the Nemissaries’ great powers won’t necessarily protect them. \n\n\n\nSINS RPG Stretch Goals \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSINS Distribution for the US is supported by BackerKit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SINS is a Friendly-Shipping Project - No Duties to the US or EU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sins is all at once an exciting, mysterious and terrifying game which crosses several genres, and contains a rich mythos with a great deal to explore and inspire the imagination, all whilst taking familiar genres that you know and love into creative new ground. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Dying World   Sins takes place in our own world, albeit\nabout a century from now. The world as we know it is\ngone, replaced with a bleak post-apocalyptic wilderness.\nSome areas of the world have been scorched by nuclear\nweapons, and others have returned to their natural state,\nbut the one constant is that mankind is no longer the\nmaster of the world.\nLarge nations or civilisations are rare, and most contact\ntakes place primarily on a local level between nomadic\ngroups and small settlements. There are exceptions\nhowever, and one of the core themes of the game is the\nre-emergence of civilisations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Monstrous Enemy   A major aspect of the setting are the aforementioned Brood, which are best described as\na vast horde of highly mobile animated dead who\nshare a dim collective consciousness and have the\ncapacity to evolve into more dangerous, specialised forms.\nIt’s a mistake to view the Brood simply as the walking\ndead, because as their numbers grow, they begin to hear a\nstrange, unearthly call, which lends a frightening degree of regenerative endurance and cunning\ncoordination to their actions.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForgotten Horrors  A major part of the world’s history,\nand one of the reasons for the dramatic fall of civilisation was the\nemergence of seven individual beings with almost god-like\ndestructive capabilities and the capacity to control the\nBrood. These creatures, now most commonly known\nas the Reapers, slaughtered their way through the largest\nconcentrations of military might, and personally took a\nhand in the murder of many of the world’s leaders.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the height of their reign of terror, their victory seemed\ncertain, but after a succession of surprising setbacks,\nincluding the death of one of their number in China,\nthey seemed to disappear utterly. The Reapers now\nrepresent one of many unsolved mysteries for players\nto potentially stumble upon. Dark Heroes  The beings which players portray were originally individuals consumed by the Brood, who fought back against their Hive-mind to retain a sense of self-awareness, and as such, regained their human forms and consciousness. Striking out against the Brood, they became known as the Nemissaries, after the ancient Greek goddess of retribution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a way, the Nemissaries sum up everything about the\nsetting. They are at once monstrous, forced to survive as\nparasites, feeding on human emotion, but also incredibly\npowerful, capable of leading the way into a new future,\nand even opposing the Reapers, should they re-emerge.\nNemissaries have many powers at their disposal – not\nleast of which are the five primal Songs granting control over Blood, Bone,\nFlesh, Will, and the Brood. Collectively, these Songs of eldritch power, along\nwith their impressive physical abilities, allow Nemissaries\nto overcome almost any opposition, particularly when they\nchoose to work together.\nNemissaries have a dark side as well, however – a strange\nwound in their soul, perhaps a side effect from their\nrebirth, or the lingering power of the Brood. In any\ncase, every Nemissary contains their own worst enemy, and greatest weapon, inside of them - The Hollow. A demonic alter-ego of\neverything a Nemissary hates about themselves, the Hollow is an internal monster that\njust wants to watch the world burn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Judges The downfall of the 21st Century began with a\nphenomenon known as the Black Rain, where a great\nnumber of crystalline objects, most roughly the size of\ncars, but many much smaller, fell to Earth. These objects\nhave now come to be known as the Shards, and represent\none of the deepest mysteries of the 22nd Century. On the one\nhand, most of the Shards seem to repel the Brood, but\non the other, they often also have a damaging effect on\nthe human psyche, forcing people to relive the mistakes\nof their lives, sometimes driving them to insanity or death.\nSome of the Shards are also known to be more positive,\noffering a strange sort of oasis in the wastelands of the\nworld, free from the Brood. It has also become common\nknowledge that the tiny fragments of the Shards – also\nknown as Voidglass – are extremely damaging to the Brood.\nThe Shards themselves are also capable of communication,\noften giving out cryptic advice to the Nemissaries,\nalong with spiritual guidance, but anyone who spends\nprolonged time communing with one will soon begin\nto suspect that the Shards know far more than they are\nwilling to tell... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Conspiracies  We’ve mentioned that in the world of Sins, civilisation as we know it has fallen. The existence of the Nemissaries has offered new hope, but also brought about new conflicts and pain. Across the world, new powers are emerging. Some extol the nearly-forgotten virtues of Democracy and Freedom. Others are authoritarian dictatorships. Behind it all however, are the influences of the First-born – the eldest of the Nemissaries – who have begun to use their powers to build their own visions of the future. The Nemissaries themselves, along with mankind as a whole, have often fallen in with the factions these powerful individuals have woven about themselves. Their gathered followers preach their ideals and cooperate with one another, rebuilding human civilisation but also setting the stage for the horrifying conflicts to come. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope and Despair The world of SINS is bleak,\nand even considering everything we’ve just mentioned, it\ngets worse. The Brood is not defeated, the factions of the\nNemissaries are at each other's throats, and the Reapers\nare still out there somewhere, licking their wounds. Worse\nstill, powers long asleep have begun to take an interest in\nthe mortal world for the first time in millennia. The truth is though, is that SINS is really about hope. The\ncharacters you play, for the most part, are those individuals\nwho want to change the world for the better. They are\npeople who aren’t content to let their loved ones die, or to\nbe the pawns of mad gods.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey mean to make the world a better place, or die in the attempt. This is the choice\neach player will make – the choice each character must \nmake – to stand and fight when the dawn seems furthest,\nor to just be one more collaborator in mankind’s demise.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaught Your Interest? Great! This is a 357 page, full colour, Core Rulebook, complete with everything needed to play and stunning artwork throughout, all by Will Kirkby (Grenade , Wraithking,  Tuk Tuk ,and featured in Image Comics, Oni Press, and the upcoming Critical Role Artbook) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur plans are for at least another 3 further major expansions which will be released over the next 3 years, along with smaller, intermittent supplements supporting the game's longevity and an active social media presence that provides weekly lore updates and free, supplemental scenarios and game prompts. In other words, once SINS is out, we'll constantly have new content for players to explore - handy for those busy weeks where the GM might not have had time to prepare! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSINS runs on its own unique engine, the HOPE engine, based on Degrees of Success from small, attribute-based D6 dice pools that average 7 die and never exceed 10 die, even at the top levels of play. Players gain Successes determined by Skill Ratings, and compare their results against target numbers to gauge if they've scored a Success or not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GM sets the amount of Successes required to pass an Action, and any more Successes than required become outcome, a unique system that allows for epic, cinematic and co-operative actions. The game boasts over 100 unique powers, known as Arietta, and over 75 Skills, Traits and Qualities with which to affect both mechanics and narrative, supported in play with an easy to read, single-page character sheet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the SINS system is the lack of a conventional levelling system. Instead, characters take narrative-based paths towards their goals with Motivations, and as they work towards them, they gain Achievement Points. These in turn can be used to mechanically increase a character's stats, skills and abilities in the more traditional sense. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacters can also call on Motivations they believe to be important to the Session or events in play, and receive appropriated bonuses as a result. We believe this integral combination of narrative and mechanics right at the heart of the system is the perfect balance of progression and achievement, and defines SINS as a truly narrative-driven roleplaying game.  The SINS system, and in turn the HOPE engine, have now been play-tested by hundreds, including both private groups with varied experience levels, and by open display groups at the 2017 UK Games expo, each to overwhelmingly positive feedback. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As with any Kickstarter, the amount you choose to pledge will reflect the products and extras you receive. As both avid Kickstarter backers and Roleplayers ourselves, we understand that too much choice and not enough budget can be overwhelming! To that end, we're keeping our tiers simple, affordable - and we believe - worth every cent & penny pledged.We also offer a tailored pledge tier exclusively for Brick & Mortar store owners and independent retailers looking to stock SINS, allowing us to bring the game to as wide of an audience as possible, all whilst supporting the local gaming stores that make this RPGs and the tabletop industry possible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world as we know it is gone, and the undying horde are countless.

It was bounced around amid all the other creative ideas he keeps in there for long enough for it to grow to maturity. From time to time he would bring it out to the table to play in one form or another and then put it back and let it grow some more. \n   It might have stayed a hidden from the world at large if not for a post-game conversation with his local game store owner that moved onto the topic of how there was now enough of SINS in Miquel’s head to fill a book. \nIt’s a little known secret that games store owners are generally very enthusiastic about games and are often very good at sharing that enthusiasm. \n  Some enthusiasm for the idea became the encouragement to take things a step further.\n And the project to make SINS  - the RPG began. \nOne of the really nice things about this book and this project as a whole is the way the game was developed and refined through a network of eager and talented people that all frequent that very same games store. \nIn fact everything from play-testing to proof reading, artwork to layout was done by people, amateur enthusiasts and professionals both - from that very same gaming community. Even the making and printing of the GM Screens has been done by a printer that is a regular to our local gaming store! Another little known secret about games store owners is that they can be very, very patient people and even though this project has been in development for almost 5 years now, with a lot of ups and downs and some major shifts in both the industry and the RPG market, there has always been members of the team carrying the torch and keeping an eye on the light at the end of the tunnel.\n SINS, like many tabletop RPGs, began life as a simple collection of ideas around a kitchen table many years ago. Since then, it has grown into a fully fledged book, and proof-read copies have graced many darkened kitchen tables and game rooms up and down the UK in the last few years. After all this time of tweaking and revision, we believe now is the time to bring the franchise into the wider market, and utilise this Kickstarter to establish ourselves as a small start-up team with a wealth of ideas just waiting to be realised. \nUltimately, we're really all just about having great games with friends. SINSwas born from that very act.   It is the sum of a lot of influences poured into a great big melting-pot and stirred thoroughly with the spoon of enthusiasm and left to simmer until it was good and ready.\nBack in 2014 when we showed SINS to some people over at Chronicle City one of them said of it;“it wears its influences on its sleeve” and we believe that it truly does just that.\n   At its heart, Sins is a game that pays influential tributes to lots of things that we love, and all of it served up with a little of our own seasoning.\n  We hope you get to enjoy it as much as we have. - The SINS Team \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this looks pretty complete... Why Kickstarter?  \nOur Ultimate Goal - is simply to get a book that we love out there and available to gaming groups and to as many people as possible, and we believe that Kickstarter is the best medium to do this as the SINS Project establishes itself in the industry. Alongside that, we also value the support of 'Brick and Mortar' stores, who we recognise as being integral in the growth of any roleplaying product and vital to the communal spread of tabletop games. Through Kickstarter's tiered pledge system, we can offer Brick and Mortar stores varying degrees of support for our game in a way that benefits both us, them, and most importantly, players!  \nStores that back our Retailer pledge  - will be provided with unique covers, rewards and accessories directly from us, providing the much-needed extra support that allow stores to demo and run games without eating into their profits. SINS is hoped to be the first of many high-quality tabletop games in our planned repertoire that interact and evolve alongside both their playerbase and the commercial market, and if our feedback from the UK Games Expo is anything to go by, we believe it demonstrates our ability to deliver premium, professional-standard games straight from humble beginnings, all whilst doing service to the local gaming stores that made this project possible in the first place. I'm really into all this, where are all the stretch goal goodies & accessories? We could, can, and have created a whole bunch! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd these are only proofs, with a whole lot more planned and in development to support our game. But the truth to their availability is that we believe the livelihood of a game is in the quality, and the availability , of its core rulebook - and how many people can get to enjoy it. There's nothing worse than hearing about a cool Kickstarter RPG, only to find out their initial print-run is over and that you have to wait to get to play it... To that end, we're only focusing on getting out core rulebooks - as soon as we possibly can. They're finished, so there's no reason not to! The more orders we receive for the core rulebook, the quicker you and your players can get it to your gaming table.  No fuss, no frills, and certainly no delays or waiting around on accessories and extras yet to come. Simply a complete, finished corebook that you and your gaming group can enjoy as soon as possible. If we can deliver that, we can launch a fully-fledged webstore with all of our books, accessories and future releases available at affordable prices, forever. \n\n\nSINS RPG Confirmed Accessories \n \n\n \n\n\nThese accessories will be available as add-ons, along with additional copies of the book through the BackerKit checkout.\n\n\n\n\nSINS RPG Prophecy Cover \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSINS RPG Voidglass Cover \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            LINKS: TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | SPOTIFY \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges None! We've spent a considerable amount of our own time prior to this Kickstarter ensuring that our book and additional products are complete, proofed, playtested and ready to go to print. Our only risks and concerns lay in potential manufacture and shipping delays which we hope to avoid through concise delivery management aided and supported by the individual ordering system that Kickstarter offers.

    "textDescription": "Story The Bird’s Eye View Map of Atlanta in 1892 is our first puzzle. We are excited to bring this beautiful historic image to life in a tabletop format. As we are located in Atlanta, this project is special to us, and we hope to you as well. The puzzle is comprised of 1,000 unique pieces and measures 20 x 28 inches when assembled. \n\n\nPuzzle prototype box design - subject to minor changes \n \n\n \n\n\n About the Map & Artist:  Augustus Koch was born in Germany in 1840. He moved to the US before the Civil War where he served in The Corps of Engineers. After the war, he traveled to cities around the country and illustrated Bird’s Eye View maps from hot air balloons. Augustus drew a series of perspective based maps from dozens of locations. In 1892, he tied off his hot air balloon near Grant Park and created this beautifully drawn map of Atlanta and the surrounding area complete with notable locations and street names. Residents and non-residents of Atlanta will enjoy comparing the late 19th century landscape to today. Whether you’re purchasing it as an activity to complete with your family, or as a gift for someone else, this gorgeous map lets you assemble the history of Atlanta, piece by piece. STRETCH GOAL:   If we can reach $4,000, we will be able to use a different printing technique to allow for a higher quality box. The puzzle itself will remain unchanged as that level of quality is already being done at the primary funding target. Should that new production process goal be reached, we will be able to redesign the box to a slightly different graphic layout.  \n\n\nBird's Eye View Map of Atlanta in 1892 \n \n\n \n\n\nHelp us make our own history as a new startup studio by purchasing this challenging puzzle. This is an important first step in our journey to bring other tabletop experiences to life. Thank you for exploring our campaign page and for your support. Risks and challenges The image design and box layout are complete as well as sourcing the manufacturing vendor. At this point, all they need is the green light to begin producing the puzzle. This campaign is essentially a pre-order system for us to accurately gauge how many puzzles to produce. \n\nThis puzzle will make a terrific gift for the upcoming holiday and they will be ready before the gift giving season begins. \n\nEstimated timeline:\n* Kickstarter campaign ends - Sept 14\n* Final order placed with manufacturer - week of Sept 19th\n* Production takes 4-6 weeks\n* Puzzle copies arrive - end of Oct/early Nov\n* Begin shipping to backers - 2nd week of Nov\n\nAdditional copies will be manufactured beyond the totals here on the Kickstarter campaign and made available in November. However, the quantity of additional copies that we will produce is unknown at this time. To ensure you will get yours before the end of the year, please purchase them during the Kickstarter campaign.

We play shows at burlesque events, caberet shows, and your typical rock n roll joint. Comedy shows too! Here we are in 2011 in Oakland: \n\n\nHubba Hubba Review Oakland 2011 \n \n\n \n\nWe set out earlier this year to record our debut CD, \"Kung Fu and Circus\", then a crazy thing happened: We ran out of money . Crap! So to finish our project, we thought we would enlist you, music lover. The good thing is, everyone who helps fund the project gets a copy of our CD, and if you look at the rewards section, things just get nuts after that. Imagine holding a copy of our CD and telling your friends, \"this project wouldn't of happened without my support.\" Then you can kind of turn your head up in that real cocky sort of way, ya know.

    "textDescription": "Story Help us Make a Film! Our goal is to produce this poignant, soul-stirring film using the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) mode of fundraising that’s becoming the norm for artists around the world. We believe you, the audience, might not ever be allowed to enjoy this powerful story the way it was originally conceived. Now you can…Pledge NOW! Title : “Bridge of Sighs ” is the feeling of crossing from one place to another in a manner that effects profound change. Story : When a juvenile inmate is faced with potential transfer to an adult prison for his double-murder conviction he must convince a parole board that he’s worthy of a second chance instead of potential life in prison. The story Matthew Briley tells about a lynching and the subsequent deaths of two white men is one of anger, hate, defiance, and true moral conviction in the face of madness. His story is one of redemption and hope, told by a young teenage kid who asks the existential question, “Does no good deed go unpunished? ” \n\n\nMatthew Briley in handcuffs... \n \n\n \n \nCharacters : MATTHEW BRILEY : Caught in the sick, pathetic web of his father’s hateful, angry, and violent behavior, Matthew must act on a moral lesson his father could never teach him – he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it. PETE BRILEY : An angry, hateful, racist man. He’s the worst of what it means to be a father, and his physical abuse of Matthew leads to the climactic ending, where the father learns a lesson from his son. JOE GREGORY : Nearest to evil incarnate as one might imagine, his world is one of hatred, jealousy, and violent intimidation. He leads the lynch mob in their hate-filled mission to hang Clifford Etienne. CLIFFORD ETIENNE : A black man in rural late-50s Louisiana who may or may not have slept with a white woman. Of importance are his claims of innocence that go unheard and his son, Bingo, who’s best friends with Matthew. Setting : Begins with 1962 parole-board hearing, in a country on the verge of the civil rights era, with a flashback to 1959, in a rural country field, under a canopy of oak trees, where this angry lynch mob wants to hang Clifford Etienne. Themes : Spirit of the law versus the letter of the law, where an adolescent has killed two men, but their innocence is questionable. The dilemma of what someone should do when faced with bearing witness to evil, and whether violence should be answered and overcome with violence. Issues : The recent Supreme Court ruling that some 2,000 juvenile offenders serving life sentences without parole should have hope of eventual release. The court ruled that laws requiring youths convicted of murder to be sentenced to die in prison violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Racism in the old south and racism in the new south – how far have we come since these times of peril and fear? How does lynching fit into the great American mythology? Importance : We’re living in an epoch of massive flux, where there’s a tremendous amount of angst, hatred, bigotry, intolerance, and violence as a part of our daily existence. If we can face the truth of our past, we can imagine a future of change. Production : Where is all this money going? Even though most cast and crew are volunteering their time and energy for free, we still have to pay for things like: •\tInsurance – yea, we might break something•\tEquipment – camera, lenses, lights, grip truck, etc.•\tLocations -- rural Louisiana is tough to scout•\tProduction Design – we’re gonna make it look real•\tProps – lotsa fire and some guns•\tVehicles – especially 50s and 60s cars/trucks•\tCostumes – again, 50s and 60s wardrobe•\tMakeup – actors need this for bruising, blood, etc.•\tTransportation – gettin’ to and from back-country Louisiana•\tFood – most everyone's working for free, but they have to eat•\tPost-Production and Sound – we’re professionals with big-boy toys•\tMusic Licensing and Composition – for song at the end, when titles roll•\tEtc. – snake anti-venom, mud boots, coffee, lotsa coffee About Kickstarter : Kickstarter projects work on an all-or-nothing basis: if we fail to meet our funding goal by the end of our 40-day deadline, we receive nothing. Your pledged funds won't be charged from your account until 8/29, and only if we reach our funding goal. So pledge now and pay later! Please. If we fail to reach our $1,400 goal by the deadline, all pledges will be cancelled, and no funds will be charged to your account. Sadly, this might mean the lost opportunity to make a terrific little film, not to mention that you won’t get the great rewards being offered. Don’t you want to get involved?

    "textDescription": "Story “Sydney Maree is one of\nthe world’s fastest runners. There’s no argument about that. The controversy is\nover whether he is the hero, or the villain, or the victim, of a tale that\nmight have been written by Horatio Alger and Franz Kafka.” - Bob\nLipsyte, CBS Maree v. State   explores the life of my father, Sydney Maree, whose career serves as a metaphor for the evolution of the South African state, from Apartheid to modern democracy. This feature-length documentary traces the parallels between Maree’s personal story and the historical, political and\ncultural contexts within which his life can be understood. Of particular\ninterest are the ways in which his experiences can reveal inconvenient\nnational truths, which have been covered up or subsumed in official histories and collective memory. Website: www.mareevstate.com   \n\nWho is Sydney Maree? (Background) \nBorn on September 9,\n1956 in Cullinan, South Africa, Sydney Maree was raised by his aunts, uncles\nand grandparents. Political forces kept him away from his parents. The South\nAfrican government imprisoned his father on Robben Island for his resistance\nwork with the ANC and Pan African Congress, while his mother worked as a housemaid, raising other families’ children in whites-only Pretoria. As part of the apartheid\ngovernment policy to remove ‘black spots’ of settlement from desirable land,\nMaree’s family was forcibly removed to Hammanskrall in the early 1960s. After a\nfew years there, he grew up in Atteridgeville, a black township outside of\nPretoria. Maree remembers the traumatic experience of being forced off the land\nhis family had legally owned for generations before the government sold it to Afrikaans farmers. \n\nGrowing up, Maree\ndemonstrated a talent for running. While still a schoolboy in 1976, less than\nsix months after the Soweto Riots, he gained national and international\nattention by running his first sub-four minute mile. With a time of 3:57.9,\nMaree’s performance was the second fastest high school mile ever recorded and the first and only sub four-minute mile run by a South African schoolboy,\npropelling him into the international track and field spotlight. He was named South Africa’s “Black Sportsman of the Year” and\nwon a sponsored trip to the United States. \n\nUnder the instruction of\nlegendary track and field coach Jumbo Elliot at Villanova University, Maree\nworked to become a World Record-holder in the 1500-meters, a U.S. citizen, and\na two-time Olympian for the United States. But Maree reached prominence at a\ntime when international sport bodies began boycotting South Africa in reaction\nto the legalized racism practiced under Apartheid. Maree experienced the\nboycotts firsthand; he was barred from competing internationally for four of\nhis most prime competitive years. \"In South Africa, I was punished for being black,’\nhe said. ‘In the United States, I was punished for being South African. It\nbuilt me and it broke me. But it built me more than it broke me.”      \n\nDespite\nthese hurdles, Maree received American citizenship in 1984 and went on to\nbecome a two-time Olympian for the U.S. (1984 and 1988). Maree’s victory in the inaugural 5th Avenue Mile in New York (1981), where he missed breaking Sebastian Coe's world mile track record by five hundredths of a second, placed him firmly on the international athletics map and remains unsurpassed. He would go onto hold four U.S.\nrecords in the 1500m, 2,000m, 3,000m and 5,000m races, making him one of the\ntop 5 U.S. athletes of all time. Maree retired in 1991 and returned to South Africa in 1995 to participate in the country’s democratic transition. In 2004 Sydney Maree, was inducted into the South African National Hall of Fame and awarded South Africa’s highest civil honor for “excellent achievement in the field of athletics and contribution to non-racial sport.” His life, President Thabo Mbeki said, was “inextricably linked with the struggle against oppression and racism in South Africa.” That same year, as one of the countries leading Economists, Maree was appointed CEO of the National Empowerment Fund (NEF): a state-owned enterprise within South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), established to facilitate black economic equality and transformation in the country. The Trial Shortly thereafter, Maree was charged with fraud in connection to a no-bid contract with Deutsche Bank Securities. But the close relationship between then Minister of Trade and Industry (Alec Erwin, Maree’s boss) and the head of Deutsche Bank South Africa (Martin Kingston) was cited as the primary motive for the deal, leaving many to wonder if Maree was simply a scapegoat. Around the same time, evidence damaging to the Mbeki Administration (including several of Maree's superiors) began to surface with regard to South Africa’s $4.8 billion Arms Deal. \nIn 2008, after several delays and judicial irregularities (including “missing” evidence), Maree was convicted of Fraud and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He began serving his sentence earlier this year after being denied the right to Appeal. Many questions remain, the answers to which are increasingly important as investigations into the Arms Deal reopen in South Africa and parallel investigations begin in the United Kingdom and Germany. Why Should You Support this Project? As Alec\nRussell writes, “South Africa’s negotiated transition from white rule to\ndemocracy was one of the wonders of the late twentieth century. But it was only\nthe first chapter of the postliberation narrative.”  Maree v. State is not just a film; its a campaign for South Africa's \"Second Chapter\" -- the realization of the ideals of the liberation struggle: economic equality, democracy, and good governance. Funds raised in\nthis campaign will go towards upfront production costs, including: crew travel\nand expenses, cameras and equipment, and third-party licensing fees. Any additional funds raised will be dedicated to the social action campaign. This\nproject means everything to me and I am fully invested in seeing it through. By investing in this project you are investing in me. Anything\nyou can pledge to help me share this story is deeply appreciated.

He walked into a Greek restaurant in Manhattan where Racine was sitting alone at the bar having a drink. Racine had never met a Sikh before and neither had I. Nor had she ever met a rally racer before, neither had I.  A few pages on as the personalities stretched their legs, so to speak, and additional characters appeared I accepted that I was in deeper with this writing than I anticipated. I saw that a novel was underway and that I was not the driver but rather something like a navigator.\n\n My potent crew of leading characters is heading to Africa, a place they know far better than I, and so my choices are stark: stay behind and lose out on the action – or pack my bags and go along too. \n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA taste of my writing: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges See above Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story We are trying to raise $1000 to help turn these original worship songs into an amazing live recording in hopes of taking people deeper into the presence of God. In order to do this, we have a lot to coordinate and this money is just one aspect of it. Over the years, we have collected recording equipment which will help us track everything the night of--including the audience. After the live recording event is where the money you help us raise will come in. In order to take the recorded tracks and make them CD quality, we need to spend a significant amount of time in an actual recording studio making everything sound amazing. And that, of course, is not cheap. Thankfully, we have friends who can offer us a deal on studio time to make it more affordable. Once that is done, the project must also be mastered, which is another expense.  Finally, money raised for this project will go towards distributing the music. This includes making physical copies and putting it in digital music stores (such as iTunes) worldwide. As you can see, there is a lot of money needed to make this recording all that it can be. We have estimated that $1000 would give us the funds to do all of this effectively. Of course, the more money we raise, the better the recording will sound! We hope that you see value in our project and want to partner with us to make it possible. Most importantly, we appreciate your prayers as we pursue all that God has called us to do! Risks and challenges One of the biggest challenges to using the money raised effectively is managing our recording studio time. It is really easy to go overboard and spend way too many hours in the studio racking up a huge bill or even having to stop in the studio and ending up with a half completed album. In order to avoid this, we will be combing over the tracks after the live recording and making detailed lists of what needs to be fixed and adjusted so that we can make the most of our studio time. \n\nOne of the other risks with attempting this project is quality. Getting a live recording to sound good in it's final form is very tough. To help us with that we are teaming up with a few people that have experience in this area to help us produce the album.

    "textDescription": "Story What Is The Mason-ry Koozie? The Mason-ry koozie is the first Silicone koozie designed from the ground up to perfectly fit a wide mouth pint jar. Whether it is drinking your morning coffee, your afternoon beer, or your evening cocktail, our koozies provide the best way to insulate your hot or cold beverage. At Mason-ry we were fed up with disposable coffee cups and oil and animal skin based koozies. So, we did something about it and created the koozie we wish we had. Where We Are Today We have spent the past six months designing, refining and prototyping the Mason-ry koozie. We now have the final design, a prototype that we are in love with and a manufacturer who is ready to start a production run. We are looking to Kickstarter to help us bring the first premium Silicone mason jar koozie to you! i. Conception After coming home from the 2013 Eugene Startup Weekend, Eric was motivated to move forward on his idea for a custom fit koozie for a mason jar. The goal was to create a koozie that looked great, felt great, and above all, promoted the use of safe and eco-friendly glass mason jars. Moreover, he aimed to appeal to not just the yarn, or leather koozie crowd, but everyone. ii. Prototyping With that in mind, the goal was not just to create a great koozie, but the PERFECT koozie. Eric worked with local product designer, Alex Caves to invent the ideal koozie. From the start, we identified our unique lip that sits over the lip of the mason jar just below the threads as the key to the perfect koozie: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we used 3D modeling to create a digital model of the koozie: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we used scale photographs to determine the profile of a mason jar to the nearest 1/100 of an inch. Then we used 3D printing to make sure the final version would feel great in the hand: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niii. The Result Our manufacturing partner produced samples in 3 colors for us. They look and feel perfect. We can drink hot coffee or cold beer out of our mason jars and then toss them in the dishwasher. It is a dream come true to see our vision in real life: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niv. Material Choice - Why Silicone? Simply put, Silicone is the only premium material for an eco-conscious koozie. No animal hides or petroleum products here. Just plentiful and easily sourced elements.  Silicone can withstand temperatures from below-zero to over 400ºF, is non-toxic and contains no BPA. It can be microwaved. It can be dishwashed. It can be dropped. It can be baked in the oven. It can be thrown off a tall building or from a moving car (although you may have to replace the mason jar inside).  Part of being eco-friendly is reducing the need for replacement, and by using Silicone, we ensure that our koozie will last a lifetime (well maybe not that long, but yes, a really long time). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Now For Where You Come In We are looking for $7,500 to help us bring the Mason-ry koozie from prototype to product. In return for your support, you will receive a first run premium Mason-ry Silicone koozie and a custom Mason-ry logo temporary tattoo from the awesome folks at Tattly.com. We really appreciate your help and look forward to revolutionizing the mason jar koozie. UPDATE: We are thrilled that we met our stretch goal of $10k and can offer the option of a smooth sided koozie. This design will feature a smaller logo on the bottom (shipping will be a month longer for this design because we need to create a new mold). Additionally, we have partnered with EcoJarz to bring you an awesome lid. The lid shown below can be yours by adding $6 to any pledge level. Note- at the end of our funding period, we will collect all color/lid requests via a survey. \n\n\nThe smooth sided koozie is now an option as well! \n \n\n \n\n\n\nKoozie + Lid \n \n\n \n\n\n  UPDATE: If we reach our stretch goal of $13k we will bring you an additional color option. Vote for your dream koozie color HERE \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest, Eric and Nicole Risks and challenges At Mason-ry we know that it takes the right team to launch a product. We worked hard to set up everything from manufactures, to packaging partners (http://www.exceedpdx.com/ who do great things, check 'em out), to fulfillment (Fulfillment by Amazon) to make sure we can deliver without a hitch. However, we have enough real world experience to know that problems may arise. This is why we have assembled a high quality team of advisers to help Mason-ry at every step of the way. \n\nManufacturing:\nThe prototyping phase is complete and we know we have the ideal koozie. In order to make sure that production goes off without a hitch, we have partnered with a manufacturer who makes hundreds of Silicone parts and comes highly recommended. We already have samples and can see that they do great work. \n\nAdditionally, we can count on Mike Hurrowitz, a skilled engineer from Boulder, Colorado to step in and help us should any issues arise during manufacturing. He has worked with 7 different startups as a founder or early employee. In doing so, he sent out over 100 unique parts for manufacture. With him as an adviser, we can fix any problems that crop up.\n\nFulfillment\nWe also have Karen Bonner as an adviser. She is a founder of Red Duck Foods who launched a kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1309695875/red-duck-ketchup) which was successful funded on May 31, 2013. She successfully shipped ketchup to 599 backers. Compared to shipping glass jars of ketchup, shipping Silicone koozies is nothing!\n\nWe have the gears and know how in place.

They clearly put their music first and worry about the rest second…\" -  DysonSound.com ..  \nWe've done this before, and we need to do it again. 11 of the best songs we have ever written are just waiting for eager ears. So we did the research, talked with producers, recorded scratch after scratch and finally decided:  \nIn order to create a great sounding record like those we've created before, we need your help!    \nBy help of course I mean: \n1. Studio Time - Despite getting great rates and free equipment rental, Casbah Studios needs to charge to stay in business.  By our most conservative estimates we can track the album at around 70 hours, putting us at the grand total of $3,500 for studio time and tracking.   \n2. Mixing/Mastering - Regardless of who we go to, this will run about $150/per track.  Seeing as we'll go through 13 tracks (a few are bound to be b-sides), this runs $2,000 . \n3. Artwork - We've worked with numerous graphical artists and few have been as dependable and tuned to The Shape of the Earth's style as Tom B at manAlive .  He's ready to jump into the latest installment, but he has to make a living and charges us a fraction of what he charges his other clients (which include Radiohead, Target, and Columbia Records, to name a few). To design the record, CD jacket and other needs it comes to $500 . \n4. Press   - Physical copies are on the way out, but we still get orders almost monthly for physical CDs not including press releases and venues that want old fashioned hard discs.  At a conservative pressing of around 500 copies the best quotes put this at $650 . (and that's cheap ).      \nCountless other costs creep up throughout the process (food, gas, guitar strings, etc) but we take care of those so we won't even tally them.   \nThis brings us to a grand total of $6,650 for the album if we stick to the absolute minimum. If we can get this we'll deliver the ultimate in TSOTE records in just a few short months.   \nWe've been scrimping and saving but we too have to eat and pay rent so we are able to come up with 35% , and we're looking to raise the remaining $4,500 through Kickstarter. Of course, more money would mean more polishing, extra studio time and ultimately a better record, but the rational meets hopeful at the 6 grand mark. \n\nIn the past the one thing that's kept us going is support from you all, the listeners.  Whether it's comments on our Facebook page, YouTube videos set to our songs, or emails from overseas- it never ceases to amaze us how well the music resonates with people, and so we keep coming back. In advance here's a big huge THANKS. \n-Gavin, Kevin, Chris, Mark, Rich,  \nThe Shape Of The Earth         \n Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

We need help from the Kickstarter community to bring our heater accessory to life. From surfers to parents to dog owners to anyone that gets dirty, RinseKit offers the convenience and versatility to fit into Kickstarter backer’s lives. Thank you for helping to make our dream a reality. We’d love to hear your feedback, so please give us your thoughts in the comments section.

We will begin shipping June 3, 2016 . We are about to receive a large shipment and our production facility is standing by to keep up with demand. This product is built extremely well and we are confident that it will provide you with many years of service. \n\nRinseKit Heater Accessory- We have been working diligently to develop the Heater Accessory for this Kickstarter campaign and we now have a working prototype that will heat cold water to 103 F max in approximately 30 minutes. If we reach our Kickstarter funding goal, we will immediately begin engineering, tooling and full-scale manufacturing to deliver this game changing invention.\n\nHere’s what we see as the risks. MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product like this is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product similar to this and that is one area where delays could occur. To minimize the possibility, we're working with a tooling manufacturer partner that has a superb track record for delivering high quality tools on time. PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the Heater Accessory gets readied for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by our experienced manufacturing partners. We do not expect delays. In the unlikely event that we have delay, we will keep you informed. We will also inform you any changes to the performance or specifications of this product. FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go sideways that can’t be planned for; a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down or a shipment gets delayed. These things could cause a delay. We have selected a factory with a very good track record of building this type of product, with deep experience creating heating elements and rechargeable batteries. We do not expect any significant manufacturing delays. If by chance we do experience a delay in manufacturing, we will keep you in the loop about it. We promise that we will not compromise the quality of the product to meet a deadline. Your pledge brings us one step closer to the goal of delivering the ultimate portable shower system.

This constant alteration and expansion of the topography of the Island may allow one clan's villages to be glorified by adding temples and towers, while simultaneously it might destroy other clans' villages, postponing or perhaps permanently preventing their quest for glory! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add-Ons, see bottom of the page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WHAT'S IN THE DELUXE VERSION BOX? - 48 BIG Tiles (3.7\" wide and  .25\" thick) - 100 Wooden Buildings : 4 different colors -- each with 20 Huts, 3 Temples and 2 towers. - The rules in three different languages.

In 2011, we bought our own wood production factory so that we could totally control and improve the production and quality of our games. Taluva Deluxe is a real challenge for us!

We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems, as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal/delivery services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us.\n\nEagle Games (and its affiliate Gryphon Games) has completed 41 Kickstarter projects to date. 35 of those projects have completed delivery. Five of the projects are in printing right now or have already been printed and are waiting to ship. All five of these projects will be delivered on time in December and/or January (they include Musee; Baseball Highlights 2045; Mystery Rummy; Dawn: Rise of the Occulites; and Cheesonomics). One project--Clockwork Wars, is still in pre-production, totally on schedule and slated for delivery in July, 2015). We keep Backers notified by Updates about the status of their projects. We deliver on our promises reliably and usually on time (the very few delays we have ever had were related to production schedule issues which we have only, at best, partial control over).\n\nTo put it simply, you will get everything you are promised when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter Projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.

Having international artists work in Jamaica is an important part of NLS’ programming because while we grow the art scene locally we work towards a more connected global network of artists in which information is accessed openly. Wilmer is a talented artist whose work\nbridges performance, sculpture and collage.  He will be working at NLS on his project Notes from June to August.  Notes is an expansion of his work in which\nsculpture, anthropological research, and found objects, including found paper,  build to function as cultural archives.  Wilmer's project Notes offers us a unique\nopportunity to engage the rich but understated aspects of our environment, and\nthe insight that this overlooked visual information can provide. $2500 of the funds being raised will facilitate Wilmer purchasing materials for the project (such as staples, wood, staple\nguns, paper, house paint, rental of a table saw and hardware) and cover Wilmer's travel\nexpenses and sleeping accommodations for the nine weeks of his residency and $250 will go towards Kickstarter processing fees. ALL of the funds raised will go towards Wilmer's project and event programming for his residency. Risks and challenges Wilmer will be at NLS during hurricane season. Although we have never had any major catastrophes over the years, short term implications are loss of electricity, loss of water and potential flooding. NLS has access to a generator that can be used for Wilmer's studio and NLS is located on premises that benefit from good drainage and higher elevation. We also have water storage in case of emergency. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story \nI was inspired to write this book because of a friendship that started years ago, back in the 40’s, between my mother and a lovely young lady named Lucille. Lucille and my mother were college roommates and dreamed of one day getting married and having children, and that their kids would be friends too. After graduation, Lucille married George and lived with him on a farm in Indiana. They had a son and a daughter who just happened to be the same age as my brother and me; and so another friendship was born. Sadly, and much too soon, my mother passed away, but the friendship that I had with the Gobels remained strong. When I wrote to them, in some ways, it was like writing to my own mother; and when I saw Carol, it was like we had never grown up at all.\n \nSo, Gladys Sings is a story of the Gobels farm, farmer Goble and his wife Lucille, and a lovely Hen named Gladys. After that, all connection with the Gobels seems to fly out the window as my imagination takes over and I lose myself in the story line of Gladys and how she wants to be an opera singer! And so the book, a tribute to the Goble family, morphs into a book about what we can achieve when we know ourselves well, have dreams, and enough imagination, courage, and support from our community, to make them happen. \n \nI am a psychotherapist and a writer. All of my stories combine my two passions, helping others and creative writing, to offer wisdom for children in a whimsical fashion that will delight even the big grown up kids! I know when I have written a great book…it’s when I get to the end, and I am crying tears of joy! Gladys Sings does that for me, and I know it will for you as well.\n \nAnd now for the sad news. The Gobels are facing a particularly challenging time in their lives. Farmer George and Lucille are both getting up in age and their daughter, my dear friend Carol, has just been diagnosed with two inoperable brain tumors. I need to give this book to them! When you love someone and they are hurting, you give of yourself to bring whatever relief you can to ease their pain. Gladys Sings was meant to be a gift for them. With your help, we can deliver this into their hands and let them know how much they are loved. Thank you so very much. \n Risks and challenges As with any publishing projects, there may be challenges to deliver on time. If this does happen, then we will be sure to let you know what is causing the delay. As well as inform you of the new estimated date of completion.

Scott Tolleson is a Los Angeles artist who loves designing toys. He has self-produced a number of different figures like the Doc von Block figures, Tricycle Terror and his Otis and Otto sets. Scott designed one of the figures in Andrew Bell's Android Series 2, and Toy2R has also already produced one of his designs in the form of a 5\" Mini Qee: the original Uncle Argh, which is now sold out.  What is Tenacious Toys? Tenacious Toys is a NYC-based online designer toy shop. We sell art toys manufactured by dozens of different companies from all over the world. The items we sell are limited-edition collectibles: more art than toy, they are meant to be appreciated and admired by adult collectors. Our mission has grown and changed over the years to encompass the development and promotion of this genre of toys as well as the artists that design them. What is Toy2R? Toy2R is a Hong Kong based art toy manufacturer with a 15-year history in the designer toy industry. As one of the industry leaders, we trust Toy2R to create the finest art toys available.

Both the end grain and long grain blocks can be refinished after years of use to restore their original beauty. Long grain blocks are great for everyday use, and show the grain running continuously through the length of the block.   End Grain gives a much more durable cutting surface which will never dull your knives. These show the beauty in the wood grain and are very rich in color. Care and Maintenance: Blocks should be scrubbed with warm soapy water and rinsed in the sink.  They should never be soaked in water or ran in the dishwasher.  Blocks should be treated with mineral oil or butcher block conditioner, both found at home improvement stores for about $10.  With heavy use, apply oil monthly, with moderate to light use apply every 6 -12 months.  All blocks have been conditioned  before shipping and are ready for immediate use. **Message me if you would like the finger grips on the ends and/or the juice groove (no extra cost)** \n\n\nEnd grain maple \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnd grain maple \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLong grain cherry \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnd grain cherry \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnd grain cherry \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLong grain walnut \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnd grain walnut \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n13\"x18\" Walnut and maple checkerboard pattern w/juice groove \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n3/4\" Thick Maple and Walnut cutting board with a Cherry accent \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n3/4\" Thick Walnut cutting board with Maple accents \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMaple and walnut business card holders \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the new shop will do -Provide a professional atmosphere to meet with clients -A large organized space will increase production and reduce project times\n\n  -Furniture production \n\n\nEnd grain hard maple table with red oak rail.

We have 4 days to go and the project is fully funded! What a victory! Woohoo!  Thanks to everyone who donated. Need I say more? Actually...YES! So here goes...  http://youtu.be/HJCOfXQU7II UPDATE 2 Hey all! Just finished brainstorming T-shirts for the $50 level.  This is the basic design but I need your help to vote for the wording. There are a few variations of this image. So please vote on your favorite and that will be printed.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1 hey folks! i just wanted to share the first update video of the project.  We spent 6 days in NYC tracking drums, bass, and working on song structures. This is just a brief video that will give you a look into the process.  THANK YOU for your support!  I really can't make this happen without you :) \n======================================================== WHO AM I My name is Joy Ike and I love people! I love  music too! I create music to reach the hearts of people, to create lasting and worthwhile change in our world, and to do what God has made me to do! WHAT I DO and WHY I travel, I perform at universities, coffeehouses, theaters, churches, clubs, listening rooms, music festivals, special events, and art festival. I talk to middle school and high school students. I write real songs about real things.  I am passionate about what I do. I am passionate about connecting with people through the arts. I am passionate about creating lasting change in our communities through the arts. I believe that the arts are a lifeline to community revitalization. I believe words, when shared thoughtfully, and with love and conviction, are powerful and can change a heart.  I just want to live my life fully alive!  And I am about to record my 3rd Full-length album! And I can barely wait! A LETTER FOR YOU Dear Friends! The time has come!   As I write to you, I'm currently overflowing with so much anticipation. I am truly, truly excited for the things to come even though I don't exactly know what they are .  I am 3 weeks away from starting a brand new project and have been writing these songs for nearly 2 years now.  This album will be a bit different. It will be produced by Saul Simon of The Lovely Light studio in NYC.  It will be a album of primarily love songs. And i don't know how to say this except that \"I put alot of tears into this album.\"  This album and its songs hold a very special place in my heart and i really want to share them with the world...and YOU! This album, in full, will take roughly $10,000 to record. $8,000 seemed like a good place to start when recording the video, but after the doing the math, it was necessary to set my Kickstarter goal at $10,000. The funds will be well be spent on producer, musicians, tracking, mixing, mastering, CD duplication, and rewards for funders.  You can bet that I will put ever last cent to good use! My \"ask\" is that you would support this venture and that you would tell the people in your networks about it, in return for some incredibly, excellent rewards(look to your right)!   And the biggest reward is that you can finally stop asking me \"So hey, when do we get to hear your new stuff?\"  :) Thank you all for your support and encouragement over the last 7 years and to God be the glory in all that we do!-Joy \n“We all die.

    "textDescription": "Story Objective : To raise $3,000 (or more!) for travel, research, and the making of the Bohemian Book Project at ArtMill, a not-for-profit international arts center and sustainable farm, in south central Bohemia. Conceptual framework : The Bohemian Book Project is an illustrated children’s book about the relationship between art and the environment.  We will explore folk tales from the Czech Republic where there is a rich tradition of oral storytelling.  Using our individual backgrounds in the visual (Amia) and performing arts (Miriam), we are modernizing a traditional tale to address current issues about the environment and sustainability.  Our book will combine visually stunning designs with narrative to demonstrate how the earth is its own natural source of art and how we can “use the power of the land, the water and even technology to engender more creative and sustainable human problem-solvers.”* At ArtMill, we will talk to local Bohemians about the history and stories from their region, take photographs, compose the illustrations, and start a dialogue with other international artists about their own relationships to the environment.  Why ArtMill? “ArtMill borders the Šumava region, a unique and protected nature reserve and forest ecosystem.  Behind the Iron Curtain for 40 years, large portions of the area were stripped of human settlement and today it's considered the most extensive forest in the region.”* We both had the opportunity to work and teach at ArtMill in the summer of 2010, and we were greatly inspired by the history of the region, natural beauty of the land, and the artistic community dedicated to sustainable creative practices. Practical : The children’s book will combine text with full-page illustrations. The illustrations will be a combination of photography, collage, and drawing using natural found objects and recycled or reclaimed materials. The format of the illustrations will be still life photographs taken at ArtMill, which we will print and manipulate using ink and pigment to create a multi-media layered effect. The book will be approximately 32 pages long with 2 to 5 lines of text per page. We would like to print on recycled paper using sustainable practices in the book industry. Destination : Upon finishing the book, we would like to exhibit large format prints of the book’s illustrations in a gallery as well as publish and sell the book in bookstores. Goal:To create fun and stimulating material for children that drives awareness for the environment and encourages artistic exploration. Our project seeks to revive the Czech Republic’s rich tradition in storytelling by experiencing the natural world through the arts *www.artmill.eu Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

The gores are sewn onto the front and back, rather than the sides, as would usually be expected by modern standards. Why?  To keep the rain away, brilliant!  There are no buttons or zippers.  We make the hoods sustainable by using wool and linen, just like the vikings did. Easy to put on and pull off.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREWARD/PRODUCT #2 AND #3 VIKING HOOD BASIC ! \n\nChoose between 4 sizes:  Children 2-6 years,  Kids 7- 12,  Adult Medium,  Adult Large \n\nWOOL: Choose between Ice blue, green, brown, yellow, red or dark purple.  LINEN:  Choose between natural fine, natural medium, light blue, brown, red and blue.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREWARD/PRODUCT # 4 AND # 5 VIKING HOOD REVERSIBLE !   Choose between 4 sizes: - Children 2-6 years,  Kids 7- 12,  Adult Medium,  Adult Large 1. First: choose between LINEN with LINEN or WOOL with LINEN !  2. Wool colors available: Ice blue, green, dark brown, yellow, red, blue or dark purple. 3. Linen colors available: linen natural, light blue, brown, red or blue.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATERIALS & WHO MAKES THE HOODS.\nOur hoods are made from 100% linen and 80- 97 % wool. Both linen and wool fabric are woven and made in Europe.  A group of expert tailors in Basque Country, Spain, are making most of the linen- and reversible hoods. http://www.dobentextil.com\nIf you want 100 % wool let me know and I might be able to find a good woven fabric.  \nSome of the basic wool hoods are proudly Made in Norway as I am trying to make them as local as I can! The reason is that I want to explore different production model before I have more hoods made.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIZES, FOR MEN & FOR WOMEN?  The cut is the same for male and female.  All hoods are unisex. The adult size medium is good size for women and the adult size large goes well to male vikings with wider shoulders. BUT it depends of course how you like it. If you want it to be a loose fitting hood with lots of room for big long hair and lots of viking gear, go for the big one.   \t•\tThe children size 2-6 years measure  47 cm ( 18,5 inches) - face opening.   •\tThe Children size 7-12 years measure 58 cm (22,8 inches) - face opening.  •\tThe adult size Medium measure 63 cm  (24,8 inches) - face opening.         •\tThe adult size Large measure 65 cm (25,6 inches) - face opening.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROJECT AND FUTURE PLANS I started klesarven.no in may 2015 with imports and are ready to take the next step by making my own collection of high quality historical garments inspired by viking age. I hope you will help me make it happen. The kickstarter project will help me to order a large number of hoods the get a good price. Producing sustainably also means avoiding over-stock and the making of products nobody wants.  Better for the environment and no left overs to be thrown away!  This campaign will give me a feedback on the products and opens up for communicating with you who share the love of viking heritage art and style.  If the project turns out a success I will start my journey looking for resellers as well as offering the hoods at a permanent basis in my own web store. Can´t wait!    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW US! We are on Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram.  https://www.facebook.com/klesarven.no/ https://www.instagram.com/klesarven/ https://no.pinterest.com/klesarven/ And the web site of course: (Her kan du også lese mye av teksten på norsk:) http://klesarven.no ANY questions, please contact me and I will answer as soon as I can.  If you somehow need another color on the basic wool hoods I will try my best to make you happy!  All photos by Bente Johansen. Taken at Kaupang, Norway. Big hug to you Bente and our gorgeous models. Special thanks to Bjørg who made this shoot happen! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbroidery work in progress, just add 200 nok and I will make it for you on your hood!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViking hoods on TV!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges There is a risk of delays in the manufacturing process as well as with the overseas shipping + customs. However, the rewards should be in your hands in april as the manufacturer has told us that they need 20 days starting about 15. march. Then I need 1-2 weeks for shipping depending on how far from Norway you live. I will start production as soon as we reach a 100 %! \n\nAlso, we might run out of wool fabrics in some of the colors. If so I will contact you and show you a good similar other one. \n\nThere is a chance you have to pay duties to your government for importing our product. \n\nAlso, since you can not try our hood, there is a risk that it might not fit perfectly. The wool fabric might shrink about 5 % but the linen is made of pre washed fabric and will not shrink more than 3 %. Hand wash or use wool program on the washing machine. Linen: Iron when still wet.

    "textDescription": "Story Whistlestop Dance Company and Light Motion's presentation for the Pop Conference: Wheeling, Careening, and Wandering through the EMP approximately 1 pm on Saturday, April 26, 2014 In this site-specific dance, the six dancers, three in wheelchairs and three \"stand-ups\" will use the EMP Museum as inspiration. Dancers will be revealed as the freight elevator opens. Using straight and curved pathways, moving in connection and independently, they will travel to the mirrored wall near the gallery entrance.  There they will execute a combination of movements emerging from the ways wheelchair dancers and \"stand-ups\" have discovered to highlight their commonalities and their differences. Dancers will connect with each other and their reflections and synchronize the movement to the music. Then onto the Sky Church for a movement section where the dancers will careen through the space, spinning and tossing each other into long glides across the floor. Next, they will wander to Trimpin's sculpture, If VI Was IX, for pulling, passing and roaming around the tower. For this portion of the dance, the cell ringtones of the conference participants will be the musical accompaniment.  Finally, they will travel to the freight elevator where the doors will close on their dance. Risks and challenges With all live performances, there is the possibility of unexpected events. As this is a site specific performance, there will be the possibility of needing to change the dance as we go. We will have the choreographers on site for any adjustments that need to be made as well as museum staff and volunteers to ensure the performance goes smoothly.

These crafty and charismatic traders know how and where to make a fortune. In business they use various tricks and ploys to achieve set goals. Their spaceships are heavily armored freighters, constructed in a modular way with the purpose of adding further hangars and holds. At their disposal they have unique shields absorbing energy charges, which result from the enemy attack or cosmic anomalies. This race does not attack other civilizations but simply buys them. \nEveryone has a price… \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuuylto – is a race of aquatic beings worshipping science and science experiments. These little and curious creatures love gadgets and all technological innovations. They live under the surface of an ice-bound planet. Trian galaxy is a one-of-a-kind chance to study new technologies and artifacts of this marvelous civilization. Using their cunning, technological inventions they will deceive their rivals. For this purpose they use camouflage and holographic images of their spaceships. \nTechnology is a melody of a triumph… \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nXemh – it is a race known for its brutality and intransigence which strikes terror among other civilizations. These insectoid beings attack and plunder planets bustling with life. As a result, they leave exploited, destroyed, and deserted environments in which they feel best. Any negotiations are a weakness, which their rapacious character does not allow. Their warships are heavily armed machines sowing fear in the Galaxy. \nAttack is the only solution… \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nK’Haarquar – is a race living on a planet overgrown with dense, preternaturally huge jungle. These winged and agile creatures created their cities in the crowns of trees, which give shelter to billions of creatures. Their civilization is based on unique abilities to create biological constructions. Thanks to their collective abilities, they are able to create everything using living matter, including weapons and spaceships. In combat they take advantage of their numbers and regenerative abilities of their biological ships. \nAnything that lives can kill you… \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSslyx – a race of ruthless bounty hunters and mercenaries, working for the one who pays the most. Establishing cooperation with them is bound to a great risk. This race lives on the planets seized with deception or “abandoned” by their native inhabitants. Thanks to their abilities, their organisms can adapt to the conditions existing on majority of planets. In fight, they use chemical weapons and all kinds of mass destruction weaponry. Their light-armored, maneuverable ships are equipped with long-range rocket systems and wide-range self-destruction systems. In a word, these ships are flying bombs. Their fleet is composed of single units, which destruction is associated with great risk. \nSign the contract and pray for your life… \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nArvori – the peaceful, long-living race. Individuals of this race absorb food through the pores in their skin layers. They process the smallest particles of energy into the substances essential to live. They spend most of their time on worshipping their gods, which they consider the Trian race. Thanks to meditation, they increase the body’s ability to regenerate. Where the Trian race arrives soon Arvori follows coming after their gods to thank them for their gifts. They can survive in any environment, provided there is only a touch of energy in the atmosphere. Their ships are equipped with energy absorbing systems. Harnessing the energy from the environment gives them  the unlimited source of power. They use this technology in fight to harness the energy of their enemies and immobilize their units. Arvori do not execute their enemies, only use their chances to retreat.  \nMeditation and prayers are everything you need… \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nVolkharnian – This race does not have any planets or a home world, instead they live in many worlds by impersonating the natives. They use their natural ability of metamorphosis which allows them to take form of any life form know in the universe. To reach their goals they use manipulation and conspiracy techniques that they have perfected over the years. As a collective, they live on enormous space stations, the location of which is a great secret. Their ships are small and very maneuverable, and made to look like wrecks or space junk, just to confuse their opponents.  \nWe are everywhere… \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaephos – A powerful humanoid race, thought to be destroyed in a cosmic anomaly. Thanks to the unknown capabilities of their organisms, some of them survived, losing only their bodies. Maephos gained the unique ability to move around the universe freely and thanks to that they perfected the technology to harvest crystals and energy from the nebulae. In combat they use the technology of subspace anomalies, attacking their enemies where they least expect it.  \nYou will not run away from us…   \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Team \n \n\n \n\n\n  \nSeweryn Piotrowski – team leader – The author of Galaxy of Trian: New Order.

It is very important to be able to supervise every step of the production and ensure the best possible quality. The only components that will be ordered from Asia are the components made of plastic and metal. We have an experienced and proven manufacturer who has produced a lot of orders for our fellow publishers. The whole production requires a lot of planning and logistics and fortunately, thanks to the previous campaign, we have gained valuable experience and we know what to do in order to ensure that nearly everything will go according to plan. It is important to us to make sure that everyone gets their copy as soon as possible. We have tried our best to ensure you will be happy playing our game so that we can focus on creating new projects for you. We work with the best fulfillment centers.

Please remember, they are just estimates. The cost may increase depending on the weight of the box after unlocking the stretch goals and chosen add-ons. \nUSA: $15-$23 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\n \nCANADA: $15-$23 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $20-$25 to most countries.\nASIA: $20-$30 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $20-$30 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $30 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10-$25 to most countries.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n \n \n  Risks and challenges Galaxy of Trian: Deluxe was our first board game project on Kickstarter. There were some mistakes and delays but we managed to deliver everything as we promised. The experience we gained resulted in new ideas and a new viewpoint for the future projects. Through this project we hope to reach new quality of game publishing. We will do everything we can to ensure that the estimated delivery date set for March 2018 will not change and that it will be final. Of course, it is possible that some issues with production may arise but let’s hope everything will go smoothly. The development of new edition lasted 1.5 years and the project is about 95% ready. The game has had a lot of patches over time and the tests have been ongoing for a year now to make sure there are no hidden mistakes in the game mechanics. In the near future you can expect new board game projects. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir.Air! automatically measures air quality by detecting particulate matter. It can detect particles in the air, including minute traces of cigarette smoke or diesel fumes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our air quality sensing app, you can set an alarm (currently under development) to alert you if the quality level goes below a specified levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also measures temperature. It uses the new Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE), so it can transmit data to any Bluetooth-compatible device. There is no need for Internet access, because Air.Air! communicates directly with your smart phone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Easy to carry and very simple to use. Set upright your Air.Air!, open the App, and measure the air quality! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany cities have daily air quality reports, but these reports are very general. They usually do not include detailed information about specific locations. Air.Air! measures air quality on the spot, wherever you are. We believe this device may be of interest to engineers and curious minds who want to know more about air quality and are interested in collecting data about their environment. By using Air.Air! at home, you may learn a lot about air quality sensing. There are a lot of things in our households which decrease the quality of air substances and particles we do not have affordable tools to measure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dust particles are basically invisible. But Air.Air! can measure it. Air.Air! will help address the lack of tools and data on air quality.  You can compare the air at home with the air outdoors and in the surroundings. You can the device with you, wherever you go. It even works in your car. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of other ways you can use it. The reason why we built this device is because human perception usually fails to detect air pollution, making it difficult for us to evaluate the amount of awareness we are subjecting ourselves. However, when the device provides a specific reading, we get something we can rely upon and share with friends and family. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy having our own air quality monitoring system, we can potentially optimize decisions to decrease exposure to poor air. You can discover, for instance, that your furnace or wood stove is leaking and affecting your air quality more than you realized.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is  a nifty website \"state of the air.org \" in which you can type in your ZIP code and find out how polluted the air is for a particular region. The only issue with this service is that its data is too general. They do not provide the public with exact levels of air pollution for a very specific location. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir.Air! has a compact optical dust sensor developed by Sharp Corporation. In the dust sensor, there is an IRED infrared-emitting diode and a photo transistor, which are diagonally arranged in the device to measure the reflected light off of the airborne dust particles. This kind of device is especially effective at detecting airborne particles like the kind that are to be found in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust, as it can distinguish between very fine particles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also designed a iPhone (Android later).App to display tips and specific number of detected data. Good UI makes it easier to use. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp view of Air.Air! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose of us who remember the 9/11 attacks on the twin towers may recall that the EPA provided inaccurate information about the risks of the poor air quality. Many of the volunteers, not having the required equipment to test the air themselves, had no choice but to assume the information they were told was correct. Sadly many volunteers now suffer from permanent lung damage. After the Tohoku disaster in Japan, the government failed to provide data on radiation in the atmosphere. Many of the citizens knew they needed their own data, but measuring tools became hard to find. So, open source projects filled the gap (one of them being even sponsored by two successful Kickstarter campaigns), provided reliable and low cost Geiger Counters.  With Air.Air! our goal is to provide simple tools to make it easier for regular smart phone to monitor air quality in their surroundings. When it comes to quality of life, it is important to have control over the tools to conduct our own measurements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible haze in Beijing in 2012 Last year, a terrible haze engulfed Beijing. There was widespread concern about the air quality. Weather reports only gave one value for the entire city, failing to provide detailed and updated information about the environmental conditions of the city. Our device was designed and prototyped right after this event. Within six months of research and development, Air.Air! was born. We have a working prototype and we are asking the public to contribute to us, so we can bring Air.Air! finally to the market, distributing a first batch of devices to the Kickstarter community. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to release it under an open-source license. This will allow a higher level of involvement from users. There's no telling what the community may be able to do with the published information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen source makes world better. To do so, we will share all the files after we successfully reach our goal on Kickstarter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign files \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir.Air! and iPhone 4S For one of our stretch goals we would like to build an online community where people can publish and store their data. But this is depend on the popularity of the project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData center diagrammatic drawing To build the online community will require additional expertise. This is why we need your support. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Thank you! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are designers and hardware engineers with the goal of empowering individuals to collect, analyze, and share data about their environments. We have done as much work as possible to make Air.Air! as reliable and useful as possible.Building prototypes and doing a small production run, is very costly for independent engineers and designers like us. We have to build molds, buy several components and pay for the assembly. Therefore we ask for support in bringing this device to the hands of the general public. Please join us in our effort to deal with a worldwide environmental issue with a very simple and practical solution! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to all those who gave us the possibility to implement this project. The people blow show their great interests in this project and they also give us a lot of help:\nLuis Felipe Rosado Murillo, Devon Sean McCullough, Junjie Xie, Jason Wang, Kang Liu, Karl Chen, Link Li, Sun Knight, Zheng Dong, Zhuqing Kong, Jianjun Wang, etc.\n Timeline 10/10/13     Finish optimization of circuit board and mechanical structure. Optimize Bluetooth communication. Start to write documents for makers. 20/10/13     Optimize the assembly for manufacturing. 01/11/13     Develop test platform for manufacturing. Start to develop App for Android. Test smart phone. Submit our App for iPhone to Apple store. 15/11/13     Start manufacturing. 15/01/14     Ship rewards! Note that we will update each steps when finished. Specifications    Technology: Bluetooth 4.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy); range: Approximate 100 Feet within line of sight.  \n\niOS devices with Bluetooth 4.0 (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5). The new iPad, New Touch, mini iPad would use App for iPhone currently. \n\nAndroid devices supporting Bluetooth Low Energy. This is available if our second goal is reached. \n\nThe temperature can be only used for basic understanding of normal temperature. Not replaceable for precision calibrators for temperature. \nThis device can not replace medical device where Air.Air! can be only used to give suggestions of air dust level. There is no value in health claiming warning. \n \n Risks and challenges We have worked hard on our iPhone app, but we still have not submitted it to App Store. To make the App accessible, we may need several iterations to meet Apple's requirements.\n\nIn order to deploy Air.Air! at a large scale, we will need to build an automated test fixture. To ensure that each one is working perfectly.\n\nWe have finished most of the electronic modules designing and prototype testing. For the production, we are negotiating with local factories. There is always risk when manufacturing systems as complex as electronics. We will work hard in an effort to meet Howard stated deadline for delivery.

Mechabrick is a range of precision moulded plastic kits to convert your minifigs into 1/144 scale fighting robots or 'mecha'. You can upgrade your mechs with weapons and accessories and then battle for supremacy in a fast-paced board game using buildings and scenery built from your favourite plastic toy building bricks. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Robots: The robot kits themselves use the torso and legs of any minifig at their core and assemble from over 20 precision-moulded plastic components to make a multi-jointed, fully poseable 3\" (75mm) high model. Every part of the robot kits and every external attachment point on the assembled mech is compatible with standard plastic building bricks and minifig accessories allowing infinite customisation. The robots come with a special two-part 'shield level indicator' gaming base which features a rotatable wheel to show the robot's remaining shield energy as it is depleted during the game. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Game: The first game in the Mechabrick product line is 'Gangs of Neon City'. Set in the back-streets of a futuristic far-eastern metropolis the game uses durable plastic gaming boards (supplied in the game box) printed with a brick-standard grid pattern (4-bricks square) upon which movement and shooting range of the robots is measured. It's up to you and your imagination to build, change and rebuild the buildings and scenery on your game board from plastic toy building bricks and create your perfect battle environment. The game sets two or more players in a head-to-head battle of turn-based play using 'action points' to choose whether each robot should move, shoot or both in each turn. Customisation and upgrades to your robots are key to a decisive win, but be careful not to weigh down your mech with too many upgrades and make them too slow to fight! The printed rulebook supplied with the boxed game is only 4 pages long and is designed to be fun and fast-paced for all the family. We will be publishing free add-ons and expanded rules for the game to keep even the most hardened gamers interested for many years to come. The boxed game includes four of the 'Wakazashi-Class' mech kits (two black and two white), four plastic game boards, a decal sheet to customize your mechs and your scenery, two D6 dice and a full rule/instruction booklet. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter? We are a small UK based toy design company and games/minifig accessories are a new direction for us... in fact, they are more of a pursuit of personal dreams made possible only by Kickstarter. Although we believe this to be an incredibly cool idea and are confident of its success, we need to raise the funds to cover the high up-front costs of making precision injection moulding tools to manufacture the robot kits. If successful, we aim to support the Mechabrick range with further new products, rule updates, instructions for building new buildings and scenery for your game board and an expanding backstory for many years to come. Kickstarter Exclusives: If you back our Kickstarter, you are special, and you can get something special in return. At certain pledge levels you will get one or more of the following exclusive, limited items: \n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals: Yeah, there HAVE  to be stretch goals! We are extremely excited about some of the cool stuff we have on offer if we are able to get over-funded. Here's what we plan to do (updated as we pass each goal): \n\n\n\n\n\nThe other cool thing we are offering... at any pledge level of £60 or more we will automatically include one of EVERY stretch goal item that we get to produce with your reward. That's potentially up to £49 worth of free stuff! The pledge levels available and reward packages are: EARLY BIRD OFFERS: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTRA!!! POST-FUNDING EARLY BIRD LEVEL! \n\n\n\n\n\n STANDARD PLEDGE LEVELS: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping: We have included a nominal amount for world-wide shipping from the UK for all overseas pledgers. This is just £5 for pledge levels involving models and £10 for pledge levels including the boxed game. Please be sure to add this to your pledge level amount if you are outside the UK. EXTRAS!... By popular demand we have now added the option to add extra items to your basic pledge level allowing you to customise your rewards bundle. Please choose the extra items you want from the list below, add the stated amount to your pledge level for each extra you want, then we'll ask you in the survey at the end of the project what items you want for the amount you have pledged. \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Dubreq are an established company with a number of mass-market products under our belts. That said, we have set ourselves the challenge of meeting or exceeding the quality and tolerances of minifigs themselves on all our Mechabrick products so attention to detail and a good relationship with our moulding company will be key. With that in mind we are working with a UK based moulder who is experienced in making small, high precision plastic parts who we believe can meet our needs.\n\nPhysical packing and fulfillment of the Kickstarter rewards will be our next challenge. To help with this we have secured the help of a local fulfillment company who can work from our packing lists to dispatch all the rewards in a timely manner.\n\nTo ensure we have enough time to get the products right and get the rewards shipped we have allowed ourselves at least 1 month more than we anticipate we will need to go through the manufacturing and shipping process.

We have been open for a year and want to open a non-profit cattery and a cafe to support our cats. \n\n\nKittens At Cat Cafe Mad during Kitten Day \n \n\n \n\n\n \n There are usually about 20 cats at all times, with six of them being permanent resident cats and the others are fosters who are adoptable. It is a unique place to go for a cup of coffee, and to hang out with cats as well as cat lovers. People come to play games, do homework, meet new people, come to fun events and, of course, to cuddle with cats. \n\nWith our expansion, we will be building a wall to completely separate the new café and the cat area. This wall will have a full set of windows to see through to either side. City health codes require full separation between animals and food preparation, which is the reason we currently have self-serve drinks and no food. For the sake of simplicity we will call the side with the cats the cattery. The goal is for the new cafe to support the cattery. This supports both the fosters and our permanent resident cats.  \n\n\nCat Cafe Mad: Home to fosters \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of our cats come from local shelters , and most of them are at the café temporarily, as a foster home. We work with Community Cat of Whitewater, WI, to bring in cats that will be comfortable in the café. These cats of all ages and personalities thrive in our community. They are all looking for permanent homes! With the expansion, we will have slight changes in the cattery. We are going to separate the café and cat area with a wall, but also separate them by turning the cattery into a nonprofit. This will mean that we can allow people to come in to volunteer, and spend more time with our cats. Once the cattery turns nonprofit we will also be able to accept donations from the community to help with the fosters care. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs great as the café is, it's still a foreign concept to many. Most who visit are walking by and looking for a good cup of coffee and a place to hang out. However, many are disappointed when they find out that we have self-serve coffee and no food. We are looking to enhance the customer experience by providing quality drinks and freshly baked goods. In doing so, we can serve people who are not looking to go into the cattery, but are fine with grabbing a drink for the road, or just looking at the cats through our window wall.\n\nMaking a purchase from the café area will also reduce admission to the cattery. This also helps our cats have an additional layer of protection since some of them are quite the escape artists! \n\n\nCat Cafe Mad: Home to fosters \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\nWe will build the wall with windows. We'll need to set up the cafe with a coffee grinder, espresso machines, commercial mixers, refrigerated bakery shelves, tables, chairs, etc. We will need to install working water as well to meet city health standards. \n\n\nExpansion Model \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we've set target and stretch goals: \n$9,890 Bring water in the cafe (hot and cold). Build a wall with small windows. Serve baked goods & great, real coffee drinks \n$24,000 Larger windows & crepes. Serve crepes for breakfast, lunch and dessert. Vegan & build your own.  Buy new furniture (instead of reusing the cattery's scratched up tables), full kitchen appliances.   \n$30,000 , TV set for viewing the cattery in the cafe, an ice machine and a large bay window in the wall. Sealed tunnel for the cats to visit the front window. \n$50,000 Move closer to campus downtown \n$100,000 We'd love 2 more: New Jersey & Florida \n Goal 1: $9,890 Wouldn't you like to sit by the window and watch the kitties as you enjoy your drink? To do this, we'll build a wall with one window (to see the cattery while you eat). We'll  be able to serve hot freshly ground coffee, and cappuccino. We'll be able to put a refrigerator and the sinks to go with our new water source. We will get supplied fresh baked goods from a local bakery in Madison.We know our customers and our cats deserve a cleaner space and hot water to wash their hands. We have to use bottled water as our store doesn't have water. The money will be used to install piping and running water.  The water set up is mandatory by the health department to open a cafe. \n\n\nChocolate Cappuccino at Cat Cafe Mad \n \n\n \n\n\nStretch Goal 2: $24,000 Come in and smell the crepes as they grill.  Sit and have your uniquely blended cafe drink or one of our fresh fruit smoothies with a great dessert crepe. Have a breakfast crepe on a Sunday morning and a dessert crepe to share. We will build out the kitchen with a full sized refrigerator & crepe grills. Watch the kitties as you eat from the large glass window. Take your drink and go play in the cattery. We will also build the wall with a large bay window with ledges so the cats can come say hello \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At this point we will open the coffee shop: espresso, cappuccino, frappes, kitty named drinks, pastries, crepes for breakfast, lunch and dessert. Our customers will enjoy hot/cold whipped drinks and genuine French crepes, vegan gluten free savory crepes and even a \"choose your own crepe\" menu item. \n\n\nBanana Split Crepes \n \n\n \n\n\nStretch Goal 3: $30,000 Enjoy crepes, a pastry from our display case, and a frozen drink while you watch cats from our large bay window and the cat tunnel.   We will open our non-profit, and install a TV monitor in the cafe side. We want people to be able to watch the kitties through the TV. We already have webcams set up! We'll have a great pastry display case of your new favorite goodies. We'll be able to improve the menu with our new ice machine. Don't forget our crepes but also enjoy them with a wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetable smoothies. Also, you'll be able to enjoy watching the kitties inside the sealed plexiglass tunnel when they visit the front window. \n\n\nBreakfast & Lunch Crepes: Vegan Too \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\nStretch Goal 4: $50,000 Move to State Street or closer to campus : Right in the center of town, we'll be walking distance from the University of Wisconsin and directly in the heart of the city. It will have all the previous goals incorporated. It will be a full service crêperie and coffee shop with a huge area for the cats to play and hang out with humans. We'll have parties, relaxation, and cuddling with your favorite cats! We've found a place, please don't let it get away!!! Stretch Goal 5: $100,000  We will open our next Cat Cafe in New Jersey or Florida . The new location will be a sister clone of Cat Cafe Mad. Let's expand the help we provide to the cats and local communities! Membership in one cafe will count in the others also. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Goal One: Bring water into the store from floor below.  Completely build the wall to the Health Department specifications; build the kitchen: fixtures for barista coffee, frappes, pastries, etc. \n\n\nTarget Goal: Wall, Water & Cafe \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n                 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCat Lovers \n \n\n \n\n\n All Backers over $20 will be invited to a free Backers Night before we break ground for the wall. Backers over $75 will be invited to a pre-open special in the cafe. Free coffee drinks and crepe samples will be served .  All Backers will receive opening day discounts . \n\n                  FATHER'S Day Reward: We've added a Father's Day Reward. The same limited edition Tshirt below in Black, will say \"Cat Dad\" below it. And a free entry for Dad any time. $30 \n\n\n\nCrazy Cats & Lovers \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nLiz's $35.00 Print \n \n\n \n\n\n \n                \n\n\nRock Star Royalty \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                 \n\n\n\nIt's About the Cats \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cat's Bag: Complete Merchandise Package \n \n\n \n\n\nMerchandising Package $250: Includes Bag, T-Shirt, Mug,  Cap & Pen  \n\n\n\nKing & Queen of Cats \n \n\n \n\n\n Just added: One of a kind Maggie Szpot oil painting:  maggieszpot.com \n\n\n\n$375 Reward: Maggie Szpot Original 16 x20 Painting \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add On Instructions: To Add a Add-On to your pledge: \n1) Press the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button  \n2) Increase your pledge  in the \"Pledge Amount\" by the dollar total of add-ons you want.  \n \n3) After the campaign is over, you will receive a survey where you will be able to tell us which add-ons you want to receive. \n\n\n\nShirts and Shirts \n \n\n \n\n\n                                 \n\n\nIn the Bag \n \n\n \n\n\n \n  \n\n\n\nT Shirt Add On: $25.00 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nT Shirt Add On: Youth : $20.00 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nAdd On Mug: $25.00 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n  \n\n\nCarry Bag $15.00 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\nComputer Back Pack: $100.00 \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nEvery Little Bit Helps: Add-on Pen $6.00 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n Risks and challenges We want to make sure everyone gets the full service experience at Cat Cafe Mad. When we started, we could only afford to do self-service coffee and drink service because health restrictions do not allow for cats to be in an area where drinks are made. Now that we have become established, we are taking 1/3 of our space and converting it into a separate coffee shop - there will be a wall with windows dividing the space from the larger cat area. This allows us to provide everyone with full service drinks and small baked goods or crepes. The food would have to stay in the shop area, but the drinks could be taken back into the cat room and enjoyed in the company of our friendly kitties. We will require lids on all drinks taken into the cattery. \n\nWe are taking a risk investing in this change to our layout, but this is how other successful cat cafes around the US are operating. We want you, the customers, to get the full cat cafe experience. We also think separating the cat area will make the cats feel safer and prevent escapes out the front door. We don't want to lose a cat like when we lost one of our cats for awhile! One downside is there will no longer be cats in our front windows. Our solution to that will be to put a TV screen showing video of the back room in the front window. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story [Scroll down for English Version] Chi siamo? Pagella Politica (www.pagellapolitica.it ) è un progetto indipendente di fact-checking. Nato dall’idea di un gruppo di 10 giovani professionisti che, incidentalmente, sono anche amici. Ha l'obiettivo di monitorare le dichiarazioni dei principali politici italiani e valutarne la veridicità. Diamo un voto alle frasi che verifichiamo su una scala da “Vero” a “Panzana pazzesca”. Il nostro lavoro è stato ripreso, tra gli altri, da Le Iene , La Stampa , Il Corriere della Sera , Otto e Mezzo , The Economist , The Washington Post e il New York Times .\nLe nostre brevi biografie sono disponibili qui .\n \n\n\nLa squadra di Pagella Politica \n \n\n \n\n\nNon abbiamo proprio nient’altro da fare?\n  In realtà, sì! La maggior parte di noi ha un’altra occupazione e fa tutt’altro nella vita. Nonostante ciò, siamo uniti dalla volontà di vederci chiaro in quello che accade in politica, e dalla consapevolezza che nell’era di internet e degli open data la verità è, spesso, a solo qualche clic di distanza. Perché permettere ai nostri politici di diffondere dati sbagliati e distorcere così la nostra comprensione del mondo che ci circonda?\n\n Come useremmo i €10.000 che speriamo di raccogliere? Ricercheremo, disegneremo, produrremo e diffonderemo almeno 5 fact-checking animati, della durata di 90 secondi ciascuno, tra settembre e dicembre 2015. Sceglieremo le panzane più rilevanti e virali e - siccome la panzana è bipartisan - ci assicureremo di coprire ogni parte politica. Eventuali fondi aggiuntivi verranno usati per promuovere i video ed ottenere un impatto maggiore, assicurandoci di raggiungere i politici e ottenere una correzione.\n  Perché vogliamo fare dei video?\n  Perché pur avendo pubblicato più di 1.800 fact-checking sul sito ed attivato tante collaborazioni con importanti canali media (Virus su Rai 2, Mix 24 su Radio 24, Linkiesta, il Corriere della Sera, ecc) il modo più efficace di far circolare i nostri contenuti ci sembra essere quello di brevi video animati. Magari non hai voglia di leggere un fact-checking di 5.000 battute sul Fiscal Compact; ma se ti facciamo un video divertente con Pollock*, come farai a resistere? Inoltre un video è più difficile da ignorare per i politici a cui vogliamo richiedere una correzione!\n \n\n\nPollock l'acchiappa-panzane \n \n\n \n\n\nChe impatto speriamo di avere?\n Ogni video verrà inviato al politico oggetto del fact-checking e segnalato sui suoi social media. Chiederemo al politico di riferimento di correggersi pubblicamente. La nostra intenzione non è quella di colpevolizzare nessuno, ma di alzare il costo di spararla grossa in pubblico.\nSperiamo inoltre che la nostra breve web-series ispiri altri progetti a intraprendere la strada del fact-checking in video (in TV o online). Più siamo e meglio è!\n\n Perché dovreste fidarvi di noi?\n Perché abbiamo una metodologia aperta e trasparente. \nPerché forniamo i link ad ogni fonte che citiamo. \nPerché quando sbagliamo (ogni tanto capita a tutti) pubblichiamo errore e relativa correzione sulla pagina “Oops” , accessibile dalla home page del nostro sito. \nPerché abbiamo migliaia di lettori (e una comunità di 16 mila like su Facebook, più di 5 mila follower su Twitter) spesso attenti quanto noi e più di noi.  \n\n\nla ricompensa da 100€: una tazza Panzana Pazzesca su misura \n \n\n \n\n\n*ringraziamo il lettore Graziano Zurlo per aver \"battezzato\" la nostra nuova mascotte  ________________________________________________________ About Us Pagella Politica (www.pagellapolitica.it ) is an independent fact-checking project created by a group of friends and young professionals. Our goal is to monitor statements by the main Italian politicians and fact-check them. We then rate the statements on a scale from “True” to “Insane Whopper”. Our work has featured among others on Le Iene , La Stampa , Il Corriere della Sera , Otto e Mezzo , The Economist , The Washington Post and the New York Times .\nOur brief biographies are available here (in Italian). \n \n\n\nThe Pagella Politica team \n \n\n \n\n\nDon’t we have anything better to do?\n Actually, we do! Most of us are not full-time fact-checkers. Still, we are united in our mission to shed light on what happens in politics, and we are aware that in the era of internet and open data, truth is often only a couple of clicks away. Why should we allow our politicians to spread false information and, in doing so, distort our understanding of what surrounds us?\n\n How are we going to use the €10.000 we hope to raise?\n We will use the funds to research, draw, produce and disseminate at least 5 animated 90-second fact-checking videos between September and December 2015. We will choose the most relevant and viral false statements and we’ll make sure to cover all of the main political parties, since insane whoppers are bipartisan! Any extra funds will be used to promote our videos to reach a wider audience and politicians, to make sure that they will correct their statement! \n\n Why do we want to produce animated videos? \n Despite having published over 1800 fact-checks on the website and having regular collaborations with several media outlets (Virus on Rai2, Mix24 on Radio 24, Linkiesta, il Corriere della Sera, etc.), we believe that the most effective way of spreading our content is through short animated videos. You may not have the time or energy to read a 5000 character fact-check on the Fiscal Compact. But a 90 seconds video with the adorable and clumsy Pollock? We bet you can’t resist. \nAlso, politicians will find it harder to ignore a short video when we’ll request a correction! \n\n \n\n\nPollock the myth-buster \n \n\n \n\n\nWhat kind of impact are we expecting? \n Each video we produce will be sent to the politician who has been fact-checked, and we will also post it on their social media. We will then ask the politician to correct him/herself publicly. Our goal is not to single out politicians, but to increase the cost of making bold but unfounded claims in public. \nWe also hope that our short web-series will inspire other video-checking projects (both TV and online). The more, the merrier! \n\n Why should you trust us? \n Because we have an open and transparent methodology . \nBecause we link every source we quote. \nBecause when we’re wrong (occasionally it can happen to anyone) we publish our mistake and our correction in our “Oops” page, which you can access directly from our website’s homepage. Because we have thousands of readers (and a community of 16 thousand likes on Facebook, as well as 5 thousand followers on Twitter) who are as alert- if not more alert- than us.\n \n\n\nthe reward for €100 givers: a personalized Insane Whopper mug \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges While every project has potential obstacles, we believe that our track record of nearly three years of fact-checking means we are ready to address this animated fact-checking campaign.

    "textDescription": "Story \nTHANK YOU! We have succesfully reached out goal and we can't thank you enough, you've all made us so happy this holiday season! But let's not slow down. We've carefully budgeted the feature length documentary at $72,000, so going beyond the Kickstarter goal will be a great thing. We will be able to tell the story with better integrity with every dollar that is donated, so please continue to tell your friends and family. Small donations add up quick and you'll see every dime in the quality on the screen. Love to all! Unconditional Hope is not just a documentary film about one of\nthe most courageous and extraordinary women I know—my mother—it’s also a\nmovement and campaign designed to inspire more than one million people to live\nwith hope, despite whatever challenges any of us may face. When my mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in 1981, the reality of the situation was a hard fact she was forced to come to terms with. She could have given up, accepted the diagnosis, and gotten her affairs in order. She chose to adopt Hope Beyond the Conditions of her circumstance and continues to lead an epic life with ALS. The existence of Unconditional Hope creates the possibility for something better and inspires a\ncommitment to a higher quality of life across the globe. \n\nIt is a campaign to engage life with Unconditional Hope regardless of the magnitude of peril or fear we face. We want to light the world on fire with Unconditional Hope .\nAnd we couldn’t have a more inspiring example: Mariah Gladis, therapist,\nmother, wife, and one the longest living survivors of Lou Gehrig’s disease on\nthe planet. \n\nWhat would it mean to live\nwith Unconditional Hope while suffering from ALS, Cancer, or HIV?  In a destroyed economy? In a culture of\ndepression, ADD, multiple wars and school shootings? In a time when resignation\nand cynicism seems more accepted than ever? \nWhat would be possible if Unconditional Hope spread across the globe\nlike a wonderful epidemic? Let’s find out together. \n\nCan I tell you why I'm making this movie? \nMy mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease 31 years ago and told she couldn't have children because the physical toll of labor and birth would hasten the progression of the disease. My older brother Luke was born a year later, and I was born a year after that. I owe my life to her defiance of that diagnosis and its consequent death sentence. She calls it sacred denial.\n Since that day, when she was given a 10% chance of surviving 2 years , she has gone on to win dozens of honors and awards, including the Living Legacy Award - joining previous recipients such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Maya Angelou, and Mother Theresa. She has used the urgency of that devastating diagnosis to develop a new method of psychotherapy that efficiently and dramatically facilitates the healing of emotional wounds. Mariah’s work has transformed the lives of thousands.\n I’m making this movie as a tribute to her, as a permanent record of a special craft of life-saving psychotherapy, and as an answer to the question of why strangers stop me on the street to tell me “Your mother saved my life .” The film also reflects my desire to improve the quality of life for those around me. A wise person once said to me: \"If you want to be happy, make everyone around you happy. \" These days, there seems to be a never-ending battle between hope and cynicism, resignation and fighting back. By examining life through the lens of this form of Gestalt Psychology, I hope to reveal a methodology that allows people to see the world as they choose -- without the filter of the past and the anxiety of the future – so they can answer for themselves the very same question my mother asks in each of her first sessions: “What's important now? ”\n The Wounded Healer is a story of extreme courage in the face of life and death, the inspiring journey of one woman's commitment to repairing emotional traumas and empowering people to reclaim their lives as their own.\n HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO MAKE THIS MOVIE? \nThe feature length documentary currently is budgeted at $72,000. Kickstarter is \"all or nothing,\" so we thought it wise to begin with a smaller number to get us moving. We're all nervous either way! We need everyone's help to spread the word. \n*Copies of the production budget are available upon request. \nCAN I DONATE TO THIS MOVIE OUTSIDE OF KICKSTARTER?\n Yes! Tax Exempt donations are accepted.\n WHAT'S THE PLAN? We will film a psychotherapy workshop , led by Mariah, with twelve participants, each of whom is dealing with a different emotional crisis . This workshop will be the backbone of the documentary, with segments dedicated to telling Mariah's story embedded in the bones of the workshop chapters.\n The issues are both personal and universal, ranging from childhood sexual abuse, to divorce, to the loss of a parent or child. These are ordinary people , not actors, not contestants, who bravely share their life stories in order to transform their lives . As they gain insight into a specific trauma that has had a negative impact on their lives they heal not only themselves but, by extension, their families, friends and loved ones.\n  THE WORKSHOP\n The workshop will be covered with three cameras, documenting each person’s experience in three parts: an introduction to the trauma, a method of dealing with the trauma, and a resolution. We will interview select participants before and after the workshop, and gather “in the moment interviews” during the work itself. It’s a dramatic format that is both cinematic and uplifting.\n For instance: a woman, locked in a closet by her father when she was young, developed a distrust of people as a survival mechanism. Now, later in life, she’s no longer locked in a closet, but continues to distrust people. Her efforts to cultivate a relationship with a man are hampered by that distrust. It is keeping her from having a family and children of her own, leaving her desperate and unfulfilled. The walls she created to protect herself from her trauma are now serving to imprison her. She needs to know: there is hope.\n MARIAH’S HISTORY\n As a thirty-year survivor of Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS), Mariah knows the terror of terminal illness and the fortitude required to beat the odds. ALS is a progressively debilitating neuromuscular disease that leads to wasting of the muscles, paralysis and death. Rather than succumb, Mariah has used her personal struggle to deepen her understanding of the pain in others. Her love, courage, stamina and passion for her life, her family and her work are truly magical and continue to draw people to seek her counsel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe audience will have the opportunity to witness deep moments of the human struggle while identifying with the client’s capacity to change and be empowered in a psychotherapeutic workshop setting. Those watching will have a chance to renew their hope for making changes in their personal lives while witnessing the capacity of a diverse group of people to transcend differences and gather together for the purpose of recovery. The audience can enter into a relationship with Mariah that will engage their own courage, and begin to develop a commitment of living well despite life challenges or perceived personal failings. Audiences will be inspired by Mariah’s audacity in love and her stamina and passion for life. They will be inspired by the strength it takes for Mariah, as a handicapped person, to get out of bed each morning to pursue her daily routine, and function well while being attended to by a personal aide.

His credits also include commercial television productions for McDonalds, the Pennsylvania Lottery, and Subaru of America. \n\n\nMariah Gladis - Gestalt Psychotherapist \n \n\n \n\n\n Mariah Fenton Gladis was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease in 1981. ALS is a fatal, neuro-degenerative disease that attacks nerve cells and pathways to the brain and spinal cord. She was given a 10% chance of surviving the next two years. Mariah currently has a full time psychotherapy practice and is Clinical Director and owner/operator of the Pennsylvania Gestalt Center, which she founded in 1976. It was the first Gestalt Psychotherapy Center in Pennsylvania. With a B.A. from Temple University in 1970, Cum Laude, and an M.S.S. degree from Bryn Mawr School of Social Work and Social Sciences in 1972, she is currently an internationally renowned workshop leader, trainer, and lecturer and conducts five psychotherapy weekends a year locally, two ten-day workshops a year at Esalen Institute in California, and offers weekend and weeklong seminars in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maine, Arizona, Hawaii, Germany, Ireland, the West Indies and the U.S. Virgin Islands. She published her first book, Tales Of A Wounded Healer™ in 2008, the first accessible manual of Gestalt Therapy for mental health clinicians and non-clinicians alike. As a trainer, Mariah taught the staff of Mirmont Drug and Alcohol Center, the Kripalu Health Center, Esalen Institute and medical residents at The Psychiatric Institute at Pennsylvania Hospital in the use of Gestalt Therapy with their clients. She has been a guest lecturer at Immaculata College Graduate Program, the Villanova Counseling Department, Hahnemann Hospital’s Department of Psychiatry, and a teambuilding retreat facilitator for the Home Health Department of Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia. She was named Social Worker Of The Year in Pennsylvania in 2001, and in 2005, she was given an alumni award from Marymount College for Lifetime Excellence.

Rendell and five Pennsylvania business journals for her work as an international Gestalt psychotherapist, Gestalt trainer, workshop leader, motivational speaker, ALS advocate, author and champion for women. In 2005 Mariah was presented the “Hope and Courage” award from the Philadelphia Chapter of the ALS Association Serving as an inspiration to newly diagnosed ALS patients. She has also received Citations from the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives and the State Senate for Recognition of Community Service, the Chairman’s Choice Award for Citizenship from the Great Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce, and an Advocacy Award from Greater Philadelphia Chapter of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association for her work as a lobbyist to Congress in Washington D.C. on behalf of patients and their families. In 2008, she was awarded the prestigious Living Legacy Award by the Women’s International Center in San Diego, California, which celebrates the accomplishments and positive, lasting contributions of women. \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE\n\nALS will be a challenge for us to overcome, just as it is in her everyday practice. It presents challenges morning till night, and throughout the night. From the moment someone gets her up in the morning, dresses her, washes her face, feeds her, and on into the night. \n\nTIMELINE\n\nThe Wounded Healer documentary currently is in a pre-production and funding stage. We have been gathering footage for three years, covering both professional work and Mariah’s personal life. We have a large stock of archival footage, from the time of Mariah’s diagnosis with ALS to the present. Currently, we are sifting through this material in order to select the pieces that most effectively tell Mariah’s life story. In addition, there still is a lot of shooting that remains to be done. We are planning interviews with doctors, friends, patients, and relatives – all those who can offer insight into Mariah’s process, struggle, and narrative.\n\nThe timeline for production from time of funding is as follows:\n\nLocations & Persons Acquisition/Reservation 90 Days\nPre-Production 30 Days\nPre-Workshop Interviews/Shooting 10 Days\nWorkshop 03 Days\nPost-Workshop Interviews/shooting 10 Days\nPost-Production\nLogging/Setup 03 days Editing 60 Days\nColoring 05 Days\nSound Mixing/Music 10 Days\nMastering 03 Days\nDuplication 14 Days\n\nReady For Distribution.\n\nTIMELINE FOR COMPLETION: 8 Months after funding\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThe Wounded Healer demographic will be male and female, white/black, middle and upper class, educated, and 25 to 65 years of age. It also is directed to those affected by terminal illnesses and suffering from emotional distress. The narrative of the documentary has a universal appeal. \n\nBelow is an excerpt from Shaun Rein’s article in Forbes magazine “How Oprah Does it:”\n\n“She truly understands and relates to her core target market. Oprah genuinely sympathizes with her audience's struggles and aspirations. She does not pretend to have led a fairy-tale celebrity's life; rather she has revealed that she was sexually abused when growing up and has been candid about her battles with her weight. She uses real, shared pain to get closer to her audience. As she conquers her demons, her audience feels they can conquer theirs.”\n\nThe same is true of the relationship between Mariah and her patients, and will be true of Mariah and her viewers.\n\nThe film will be sent to all the major film festivals: Sundance, Toronto, Tribeca, Canne, etc. It is our desire for this film to make a global impact, and we will screen it anywhere we find a projector.\n\nVarious versions of the film will be edited and customized for release in theatres, television, DVD, foreign, and educational purposes. This will leave possibilities open for determining distribution avenues, which present themselves at the film festivals. The most effective distribution strategies will be defined at the time of the first cut. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

You can also add this to your existing physical pledge by adding £10. About Sinners \n\n\nSinners #3 Cover \n \n\n \n\n\nSinners is a supernatural/noir/horror 12 part comic book series focusing on Hope Martinez, a girl who wakes up dead one day, only to be given a black limousine and told she must drive around America picking up and dispatching sinners into her trunk that the GPS guides her to. Sinners #1 told the initial story of how she came to inherit the limo. Sinners '#2 was the story of Hope's first sinner collection, a man suffering from a little too much pride. Sinners #3, 'Night at the Motel' picks up just a few hours after Sinners #2, when Hope stops at a motel to get some rest. The motel has some very dark secrets of its own, however, and it's not long before Hope is embroiled in a terrifying battle. Over the course of the 12 issues, Sinners will deal with a sinner of each of the seven deadly sins, as well as delving into the background of our protagonist and her acquaintances. Technical Specs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Sinners comics is 36 pages of full colour. The comic is complete, and we're using Kickstarter to raise the funds to print the comic - it's like pre-ordering the comic.

Of course, if any setbacks occur, we'll let you know immediately, and make alternative plans quickly and efficiently. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story It’s easy to be pessimistic about US politics these days. An estimated 11 billion dollars will be spent in the 2016 election cycle, as government positions and laws are bought and sold to the highest bidder. Ordinary people feel marginalized from a system in which corruption and bribery are essentially legal. I myself became more cynical than ever after spending a year working as a journalist based in Washington, DC. Then, I got a phone call from this guy...  \n\n\nCharlie Hardy \n \n\n \n\n\nWhen Crazy Inspires Charlie Hardy is one of the most remarkable people I’ve ever met. He’s a 77-year-old former Catholic priest who lived in a cardboard shack in a Venezuelan slum for eight years. In 2014, Charlie returned to his hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming and was shocked to see homelessness, hunger and poverty. When his attempts to contact the state’s elected officials went unanswered, he decided to run for office himself. Flat broke and living off his $400-a-month social security check, Charlie declared his candidacy for the US Senate. His opponent was Sen. Mike Enzi, an 18-year incumbent with a $3 million war chest. When Charlie called me to let me know what he was doing, I told him he was crazy. But sometimes, crazy can inspire. \n\n\n\n\nCharlie Hardy volunteers Josh Warren and Brett Littleton \n \n\n \n\n\nPeople-Powered Charlie managed to galvanize a ragged band of young volunteers into making waves in Wyoming's elections and challenging the country's political establishment. I too was infected by Charlie’s unbridled optimism and felt compelled to tell his incredible story by making a documentary film about him called Charlie vs Goliath . Like Charlie’s campaign, this documentary has been powered by people, not money. I was joined by two other filmmakers, Jihan Hafiz and Julia Muldavin, who generously volunteered their time, traveling to Wyoming to join me on the campaign trail. Together, we’ve shot more than 300 hours of footage since 2014. Meanwhile, I've been working for more than a year with a top-notch editor, Cameron Clendaniel, and we now have a complete rough cut. But the last stages of post-production are costly, and we need your help to finish the film. If we meet our goal, we should complete the documentary by the end of September, allowing for the possibility of releasing the film before the November 2016 elections. \n\n\nCharlie vs Goliath Post-Production Budget \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Power of Hope in Cynical Times Throughout the summer and fall of 2014, I followed Charlie and his ragtag volunteers around the state of Wyoming, spending many nights sleeping in a tent or in the campaign bus. I was determined to document Charlie’s story because I felt it would inspire many others, in this country and beyond, to consider how they can make a difference even when the odds seem exceedingly long. In these deeply cynical times, it is more important than ever to remain optimistic. And while Charlie vs Goliath is a story about the problems facing this country’s political system, at its core, the film is about the power of hope, persistence and faith in the face of overwhelming obstacles. \n\n\nGonzalo and Antonio, two of Charlie's dedicated volunteers \n \n\n \n\n\nStill Running! Two years after his bid for the US Senate, Charlie is running for office again in 2016, this time for the US House of Representatives. Charlie has rallied an even larger group of volunteers and if he wins the Democratic primary on August 16, he will likely face off against Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney’s daughter, in the general election. This Kickstarter campaign will run parallel to Wyoming’s primary elections, and throughout the coming weeks we will keep you updated not only on the progress of our documentary, but on this exciting campaign run by Charlie and his passionate volunteers.  \n\n\nCharlie Hardy is currently running for the US House seat in Wyoming. If he wins the primary, he will likely face Liz Cheney in the general election. \n \n\n \n\n\nMeet the Team Reed Lindsay (Director/DP)  is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and journalist who has traveled around the world pursuing his passion to tell stories of people's struggles against injustice and abuse of power. He lived in a poor neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for more than four years and worked as a foreign correspondent in Cairo and Benghazi during the Arab Spring. He met Charlie 13 years ago in Latin America, and they have been close ever since. Reed also grew up in the Mountain West, in a small town in Idaho, but he had never been to Cheyenne until Charlie convinced him to check out his US Senate campaign in 2014. Reed planned on spending a few weeks in Wyoming, but was so inspired by Charlie and his young volunteers, he has dedicated the last two years to making this documentary. \n\n\nReed Lindsay, director of Charlie vs Goliath \n \n\n \n\n\nJihan Hafiz (Assistant Director) is a filmmaker and journalist with nearly a decade of experience filming documentaries and in-depth reports on the world’s biggest news events, from the Arab Spring to Brazil’s World Cup. Jihan has excelled at nearly every role in the production process, working as an anchor, reporter, producer, camerawoman and editor. In 2012, she was co-winner of an Emmy as a sound recordist for the HBO documentary In Tahrir Square . She covered the Egyptian uprising from start to finish and immediately afterward crossed into Libya, co-directing the film Benghazi Rising , which was nominated for a Rory Peck Award as best documentary in 2011. She covered the economic crises in Spain and Greece, told the stories of Syrian refugees in Turkey, filed in-depth features from Venezuela and Honduras, and filmed a documentary in Rwanda. Julia Muldavin (Assistant DP) has chased stories around the world, from the streets of Brazil to the open plains of Wyoming, as a multimedia journalist and filmmaker. She lived in the heart of Santiago when the student uprisings erupted in 2011 and spent most of 2014 in Brazil prior to the World Cup. She worked on short and long-form video content around the #BlackLivesMatter movement in Oakland, California and followed the movement on their most recent trip to Brazil to bring attention to the escalating human rights crises in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. She has worked as a producer, videographer, video editor, and translator for breaking news, short documentaries, and feature length films. She most recently lived in Quito, Ecuador as a Video Producer and Editor for teleSUR English, covering world events with an emphasis on Latin America. Cameron Clendaniel (Editor)  has a deep passion for building stories through film. For over a decade, Cameron's award-winning film editing work has aired on national broadcast outlets like PBS and the Sundance Channel, as well as on many European and international channels. His films have screened at some of the world's top festivals, including HotDocs, Sheffield, CPH:DOX, Montreal, and DOCNYC. Cameron is a graduate of Williams College, where he majored in Studio Art and Political Science — and it's where he first found his passion for film editing on a Media 100 system. Born in Boston, Cameron has worked as an editor in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Germany, and now lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two children. Mithun Pramanik (Assistant Editor) is a Kolkata-based filmmaker with more than a decade of experience covering regional news and making fiction and documentary films. Mithun played a key role as a producer in the film 'Fists of Fury' which won a Gracie award for Al Jazeera America in 2014. He has dedicated much of the last four years filming India's indigenous peoples, known as Adivasis. His 40-minute film ‘Vision Through Images’ about Adivasis painting was screened in 10 film festivals and won Best Jury Award in 2012 at the Affma Film Festival in Kerala. His coverage in India ranges from women’s rights, to politics and human rights issues. \n Nicolas Rossier (Consulting Producer) is an award-winning filmmaker. His work has appeared on more than 50 US and foreign television channels, including PBS, NHK, CNN International, Al Jazeera, Spiegel TV as well as Swiss, French and Swedish Public television. He has been featured in The New York Times, The Guardian and NPR, among others. His films have been screened at top film festivals and venues around the world including the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the International Documentary Film Festival (IDFA), Hot Docs, and many more. Kim Borba (Impact Producer) is a filmmaker with a background in international development and a passion for social issue documentary. Her directorial debut, Noise Runs, was awarded Best Director by the Social Impact Media Awards. At Big Mouth Films, she worked on features like 1971 (AFI Docs, IDFA, Tribeca, Sheffield) and E-Team (Sundance, True/False, Full Frame, Hot Docs). As Impact Producer for Pushing the Elephant (PBS’ Independent Lens), she used the award-winning documentary to engage partners like UN Women, Amnesty International, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill in direct action around gender-based violence in the DRC. She has lived and worked in Haiti, Thailand, Korea and Ecuador, collaborating with grassroots groups on social justice issues like access to education and participatory democracy. Risks and challenges With production completed and post-production in the homestretch, the remaining risks are minimal. The biggest challenge ahead will be distributing and marketing the film so that it will have the greatest impact possible. If we reach our Kickstarter goal, we know we can make Charlie vs Goliath as compelling and powerful as it deserves to be. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Kingdom is a finished, polished game with all the digital print files ready to be sent to the printers as soon as the project is funded. All we need is the money to start publishing it. But there is work still to do. Even though the game has been designed, thoroughly tested, and all the art has been created for it, any stretch goals that the project hits needs to be created and set for print, as well as working out logistics, warehousing, and fulfillment.\n\n We have figured out the costs and have worked it, so that we can offer you the cheapest price yet still make it a viable venture, and keep the components high in quality. Black Locust Games is a small team of 4, and we want to be smart in our planning and expectations. We want to be transparent in our communications to you, the backers. We want you to share our project victories with Kingdom as well as be aware of any obstacles that the project is facing. We are ALWAYS open to any suggestions and feedback as this project would not be possible without you. There are a lot of pledges to fulfill, plus add-ons to manage. With that being said, we are working with a great manufacturing company that has shipped successful Kickstarter projects in the past and we have full confidence that we can deliver the game to you in time. In any case, we will be happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 99% complete (not including stretch goals), we don't regard this as too likely. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

To keep this dream alive I have been traveling nearly every weekend to promote my work. While I am grateful for the adventures, I would also love a home base to truly call my own. \n \n\n\nChicago for C2E2 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMy work at an outdoor show, plus bonus stranger! \n \n\n \n\n\n\nMy dream has always been to open a retail store. I'm thinking Hampden, Baltimore. Having this space would allow me to keep my products readily available and give me more time to just WORK. Spending less time on the road will give me the opportunity to create more and become faster at my craft. Pretty soon, all this free time will allow me to take on more commissions (hooray for more portraits and tattoo designs!). But what makes my retail space so special is that this won't just be a space for my work or for just for my use. In this space I would invite other local artists to come hang out and draw with me. We can bounce ideas around, collaborate, learn, and motivate each other. Or to simply have company while we create. In return, creators can promote and sell their work through my shop. But my shop won't just be supporting local artists. I intend to regularly bring in international artists work to keep the shop new and exciting for shoppers and artists alike. In order for me to put this together I need the space, advertising, supplies and just a whole bunch of other stuff. This is where I need your help. I've put together some pretty exciting rewards, including personal notes, handmade goodies, and original art!

    "textDescription": "Story I'm Lee Zimmerman The Puppet Guy: www.thepuppetguy.com I work at a lot of circus camps, teaching kids-at-risk all over North America using marionettes of my own creation. I need to replace the puppets I've been using for the past 18 years. I want to create 10 new ULTRA COOL TEACHING PUPPETS by the beginning of March and they have to be AWESOME. I've collected and constructed dozens of teaching puppets over the years - mismatched hand puppets, usually donated by the parents of students, and marionettes of my own design, radically different from most puppets that are out there which I find to be quite lame. But, as amazing as they are, most of my teaching marionettes have seen better days - they've been on the front lines for years! I want to replace them and I want them to match, to have a unifying look and theme. If there's one thing I've learned is that if you want to reach a kid today, you're competing with computer games - you have to earn their full attention. The only way to do that? ULTRA COOLNESS. My goal is to take this program to as many kids as possible. And, now that I'm working with so many specialized learning centers, I want puppets that are more tactile, stuff that any kid can use, no matter what skill level or ability. Which is where YOU come in! The puppets themselves cost almost nothing, becauseI make them all out of 100 percent recycled materials, baby! But they take a reeeally long time to make - you're paying for me to have the time it takes to create them. And, I want this next series of puppets to be my best work to date, the pinnacle of what is possible in the ways of the ULTRA COOL TEACHING PUPPETS. And, with enough funding, I hope one day to bring this program to every corner of the U.S.... and continue to blow the minds of the kids I teach in Canada with some seriousLee ULTRA WAY COOL PUPPET AWESOMENESS. Risks and challenges My number one challenge is a little thing I like to call, TIME. That's it! I just need to pay for studio time...the more money I raise, the more I can create. If I get four thousand, I'll make twenty puppets. I have a lot of circus camps already lined up for next year, both in Canada and the Philadelphia area, but those aren't for three months. I'd like to make the most of this time, to render ideas that have been wasping around in my head for the past three decades. Plus, I'm at my all-time creative zenith.

    "textDescription": "Story Our Seattle Geekly podcast was originally from Feb 2009 to June 2011 and we had 98 episodes.  We interviewed such geeky people as Felicia Day, Len Wein (Wolverine creator), actor Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from Hellboy 1&2), authors Brenda Cooper, Seanan McGuire and we interviewed many geek bands like Kirby Krackle , Death Star & MC Frontalot . We also covered cons like PAX , Emerald City Comic Con , Norwescon & Crypticon . Our podcast ended in mid 2011, and we've been thinking of starting it up again.  It'll be mostly the same but the episodes will be shorter (45 mins to 1.5 hours) and we won't be able to cover as many local conventions as much as before.  If you'd like us back and we make the Kickstarter goal we'll commit to 1 year of podcasting or 48 episodes (not 52 due to holidays and such).  We'll have the same format, sharing our Geek Week, reviews of books, films, music, etc., interviews with authors, actors, directors, con people, etc., and other geeky issues or news. Shannon will watch horrible geeky genre BAD movies and find at least three things good about them like she did before.  Sometimes Shannon might do the interviews by herself, but don't PANIC, Matt will co-host the podcast. We'll also keep our Twitter account @seattlegeekly updated with links to news and other geeky things & revive our Facebook page to keep in touch with our fans.  The podcasts will be available through iTunes as well as our website.  Looks like our website name was bought from under us so we've started again on either www.TheSeattleGeekly.com or www.SeattleGeekly.net . We had to end the old podcast due to $$ restraints, but that's where YOU nice people come in!  We need help to pay for our Post Office Box, our marketing material & we'll be designing a new logo, any extra money will be going to get you content.  All that and the cost of the Kickstarter rewards will go to making you have a geek year of fun! If this does go through, we'll be able to re-start the podcast by late November 2013.  We'll have to get in touch with some of the publishers that we had send us books in the past, like DC Comics, TOR Books, Quirk Books & more. With that restarted we'll have time to read a book or two for our first few episodes. Some of the rewards say the estimated shipping will be in February 2014, and that's just so we can schedule all our Guest Hosts & play dates that we have as rewards. Unfortunately we took down our website in 2011, so not many of the episodes are on the web. I've found some by torrents, so if you haven't heard our show, you can Google us. Just beware of Torrent sites. Feel free to email us and we'll select an old episode to send you. Thanks for reading through all that!  If you'd like to support us, please pledge.  Our name is Seattle Geekly but we've interviewed people from all over the world, so even if you aren't local you'll still be entertained. Thanks so much! --Shannon & Matt Risks and challenges Our risks and challenges are that it might take over a year to produce 48 episodes due to family & such, but we WILL get the promised 48 episodes up! As for the rewards, there might be a slight production delay (due to our logo getting done), but I factored that in on the shipping estimate.\n\nIf you can think of anything you'd like to know more about, please email us at seattlegeekly@gmail.com Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

The game plays with common clichés and well-known references, twisting them in an unexpected way.\n  \nUsing satire, and parody, Galactic Princess toys with Humor and Drama throughout the game.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new government saw the light, self-proclaimed under the name of “Unified Galaxy”, with no other ambition than to impose their power on the entire galaxy. \n\n \n\nThis illegitimate organization, ruled by an alliance of the most ruthless and corrupted men took and kept the power by force, establishing legions of Spacecops to maintain the control of resources.\nThose who did not bow to their tyranny became rebel factions, or simply independent crews, led by their trustworthy Captains.  \n\nThis is where you come into play. As a renowned pirate, proud smuggler and captain of your own vessel, your main desire is to remain free from the government abuses. To make your wish come true, you will have to build the strongest ship and recruit the best crew. \n\n But fate has reserved other, much greater plans for you… \n\nIn your search for glory and power, a myth caught your attention; according to which somewhere in the galaxy lays a power that would bring the planets back to life. It is your destiny to travel through space looking for information that will lead you to this Power.  \nThe Myth has a name, and is known as “The legend of the Galactic Princess”                                                                                                                                  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nShip Design \n\nExternal \n\n \n\nBuild every aspect of your spaceship, define its shape and functions. Plan your strategy according to your external module placements (weapons, shields, engines, sensors…). \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, you can builda Battle Cruiser: a heavy fighter with many powerful weapons, coupled with strong shields but lacking in maneuverability and speed. Or you can create a blitz fighter, very maneuverable, allowing you to weave in and out of asteroid belts while whittling away at your enemy. \nDefine the strategy that suits you best.\n\n Your ship’s physics will react to those choices! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction Samples \n●\tWeapons: There are numerous types of weapons to equip your ship with:\n\n \nOffensive: plasma lasers, laser beams, rockets, multi-directional explosives, \t\t\t\t anti-matter charges, fusion sticky bombs, mines…\n \nDefensive: decoys, baits, cloaking devices, electromagnetic-charges, time-bender... \t\t\n \n\n●\tEngines: Engines affect your movements and speed and allow you to perform tricky maneuvers, crucial against an overpowered enemy or an asteroid field!  \nWith special engines, you can reach the speed of light.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●\tShields: Shields will cover specific areas of your ship; choose wisely which area to protect to ensure the safety of your ship’s vital functions and crew.  \n ●\tSensors : Sensors will provide you information about the enemy and other important aspects such as distance, level, type etc. They can be used to make navigation easier and also help you strategize for difficult battles.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShip\nDesign \n\nInternal \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●Monitor s:  Pay\nclose attention to your monitors. Most of the information you will\nneed is not represented through the classic interface but through a Diegetic\ninterface.  \nThis means that all your required info will be displayed on different monitors and screens of your spaceship. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●Engineering room : This room allows the engines and shields to function properly, and thus protects your ship. Adding more engineering rooms will boost their efficiency. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●Artificial intelligence room: \nThis room controls the support functions of the ship, and provides feedbacks such as: O² level, fire alert, enemy alert, door status… \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●Medic systems : Used to heal your crew from space related ailments. Further on, you will even be able to upgrade them with some cyber-implants while recovering\n\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●Prison:   Captured a political prisoner? Keep them\nhere and trade them for some much needed supplies or even information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●Cargo hold: \nThe place to keep your contraband goods.

Their purpose? \nSteal equipment and enslave crew. \nTo bring your battle to a successful conclusion, you\nwill need a clear understanding of your opponents’ capabilities, and of course\nknow the strengths and weaknesses of your crew like no other.  \nEach member of your crew can be assigned to a specific task or position. Like in a classic RTS game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battle crew's role is to protect the ship from\ninvasions, as well as invade the enemies’ ship in return. \nYou must take their races into consideration: equip\nyour melee fighters with close range weapons and your gunners with long range\nweapons. \nReal time tactical pause : To facilitate your management and tactical decisions, an active pause will help you to assign your orders. \n\n\n\nTactical \nBattles and training increase the level of experience of your crew. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe captain is the most valuable element of your crew, protect him at any cost. There is no hope for a crew without a true leader, strength and honor is the path chosen by the greatest captains of the galaxy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssign your crew members to different rooms of your ship: each crew member working on a system increases the power of its functions. \n\nManage your units with efficiency and relevance:\n  \n●\tPlace a core blaster team to control the important hubs.\n \n●\tLead your close combat unit to their target avoiding the blaster fight areas\n \n●\tProtect the important rooms, cargo, prisoners and captain. \n\n●\tUse your race’s special abilities to overcome the enemy’s weaknesses. \n●\tUse the environment to keep your crew out of the line of fire.\n \n●\tFind the captain. Then kill him or force his surrender to win the battle.\n\n \n\n\nEquipment is an important part of the smugglers' treasure hoard, and nothing is more reliable than the blasters on your ship…  \nDuring your journey you will discover countless weapons, through trading, looting, or simply as a reward.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe strategic; equip your crew members in accordance with their race or specialization to improve their capabilities and chances of survival.  \n\n \n\nBIO-DIVERSITY \n\n\nThe galaxy is vast and surprisingly full of life! \n\nDuring your journey, you will encounter many species...\nWill they become trusted allies to trade with?\nWill they be deadly rivals to battle or enslave?\nWill they join your crew as friends, or as slaves? \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSoundtrack \nIn space, the sound of nothingness can drive you crazy… and music will be more than an appreciated friend, whether during your lonely travels or enduring the vivid battles. Thus, our intentions are to provide various soundscapes throughout the adventure.  \nFaithfull to its “retro-futurism” direction, the game will therefore allow you  to enjoy classical music compositions as well as modern rhythms, and even experimental ones .  \n\nWhile the music of the trailer is signed by Dynatron , our goal for the entire game is to offer an eclectic OST, influenced by a diversity of artists with strong identities, strengthening thereby the dramatic intensity. \n\n \n\nReward Samples \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             \n\n                                                                                \n\n             \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges As in many video games, there is no challenge without risk, nor risk without challenge.\n\nOur goal with Galactic Princess is to offer the deepest experience possible: give the players a great creative freedom and allow them to experiment and discover new ways to play.\nThe relative challenge will be to offer a coherent feeling between experimentation of the sandbox aspect of the game and the narrative situations that player will encounter.\n\nWe are confident about the attractiveness of the gameplay mechanics, but in order to make the game even more interesting, we will need to produce a lot of content: more weapons, more characters, more unexpected situations, more music, more, more, always more! And depending on how much we decide to implement in the game, it may result in a potential delay of the release date. \nThis will be for the best!

The focus of our exhibit is the grounds of La Feria , a complex of buildings and monuments in the city of Santo Domingo built in the 1950s by the brutal dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. La Feria was Trujillo’s stage to demonstrate his power and wealth to the world. Today it is a very different place. The 8 minute documentary film installation will focus on the daily life of La Feria and how people experience it, night and day.  \n\n\nTeatro Agua Y Luz, Santo Domingo \n \n\n \nLa Feria is constantly evolving, During the day it is frequented by working government officials, shoe shiners, coconut sellers, dogs, and chickens. At night it turns into a center of informal activities. What was once a powerful landmark is today a center of dualities and juxtapositions. The architecture that remains is hauntingly beautiful. We are interested in creating a visual exploration of a dualistic place and how it changes character, as an architectural protagonist, from night into day and back again. Seeing a place as a character makes it more than merely a setting for what occurs within it, it actually shapes it, influences it, perhaps even determines it. \n\n\nLa Bolita, photo by Christy Cheng during scout-trip \n \n\n \nThe film will be directed by award-winning filmmaker Corinne van der Borch . Her last feature, Girl with Black Balloons was successfully funded on Kickstarter, was nominated for audience award at the Edinburgh International Film festival, and won the Grand Jury prize at DOC NYC 2011. \n Filming will happen over the course of 1 week in Santo Domingo this April and editing will occur throughout May. The film will exhibit at the Dominican Pavillion in the Venice Architecture Biennale from June 7, 2014 to November 23, 2014.  Bringing this untold Dominican story to the Biennale is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and you can be a part of it. This is an important moment for the Dominican Republic, and we need you're help to make it happen!  \n\n\nLa Feria at Night \n \n\n \nOur goal is $10,000. The way it works;  its all-or-nothing, we can always raise more than our set goal but never less. HOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK? Make a Donation to the film, and you get a reward from the list to the right. Choose the amount you’d like to donate, and the gift you’d like to receive. Once funding is completed, we will be in touch for your address and deliver your rewards by mail. But if we don’t meet our goal, we won’t receive any of the donations. Even if we’re just a few dollars short of our goal amount, we won’t get the funding. But if we go over our target amount, we can keep the whole thing. Every penny we raise will go directly to our finishing costs. Are there other ways to help? Please spread the word about this fundraiser!!  A personal e-mail to a friend can work wonders.  It’s also helpful to post this Kickstarter page on your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr -- wherever you can.  Tell your friends that you donated and that you’re a part of this film.  Ask your friends (and your favorite blogger / twitter-user) to watch our video and re-tweet our campaign.  The more people that see this page, the more likely we are to reach our goal.   Are there any other ways to get involved?   Absolutely!

In the past, I would get right up to the edge and then back off. But this time I'm going forward! God began this work and I am depending on and believing in His timing. So, I'm ready to jump! I'm tired of letting fear keep me from doing what I know I God is prompting me to do. I will lean not on my own understanding and trust that He will make my paths straight. Thank you, in advance, for your prayers, support and encouragement! The plan going forward: After funding is acquired, the fun begins! This is an incredible endeavor. I have a studio lined up that will handle recording, mastering and producing the album. This will take some time! It will take many of hours of recording, tweaking, retweaking and mastering. I will give regular updates so you can know how recording is going and how you can pray for us. While we are recording (actually, even as we write this) we will be working on album title, art and marketing. This will be a fun but exhausting time of poring over ideas, designs, information, etc. and compiling everything into a concise, clean plan. After mastering is complete we will submit the album for production and distribution. We will lose 7-10% of the funding right off the top due to costs of running credit cards, the use of the kickstarter funding platform, etc. (We have done our best to figure this into the funding request amount). When production is finished, the fun stuff really amps up! We will then mail out/give links to the new album, plus any extra special gifts to those who qualify and have helped fund the project. We are thankful to everyone, every gift, every bit of encouragement and every prayer! Risks and challenges **VERY IMPORTANT: Kickstarter is an \"all or nothing\" fundraising forum -- so if you decide to make a pledge but February 14th arrives and we are still short of $5K, the project will sadly fall through. For this reason, your card will not be charged until the deadline is over, and ONLY if we reach our goal... so any way you can help promote this page and spread the word would be greatly appreciated!**\n\n**Also, we are always able to raise more funds than our goal (just not less). Raising more funds will allow us to record more songs for future albums.**\n\nThank you and God bless you!!! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Installations which use projection and other materials to create a true environment bring the work into being.  For my upcoming show at Delicious Spectacle, I will capitalize on the domestic space of the gallery to create a highly intimate space for viewers to experience the video work. It will be both a private and shared experience that taps into memories and the excitement of younger times, enhancing the nostalgic and contemplative nature of the work.  In order to do this, the room must be furnished appropriately, housing for the projector(s) must be built as well as a surface/screen onto which the video(s) will be projected.  Anyone who knows me knows how serious I am about pursuing my art. This show is a huge opportunity for me. It is a chance to make my work known to many, many art professionals in DC. I want to go all out and make this environment everything the video needs it to be. I want to sacrifice nothing. Your contributions will give me this chance. Thank you so very much for supporting me at this very important time.  **The video shown is from my last installation.

Can't give it all away now! ;)** Risks and challenges The challenge is creating an optimal viewing experience for the video(s). On their own, they're interesting, but, I want people to really sit with them and take them in. The installation cannot be too intrusive, though, and take focus away from the video. They must compliment each other. The risk is not having enough funds to take the installation far enough. Half way will not work.

    "textDescription": "Story Overview of Project: We want to build houses for bats! It sounds crazy right?!  As your head is filled with thoughts of rabies, Dracula and the uncountable movie scenes of bats in a tangled mess of hair, you may be asking yourself “Why bats?”  We all know that bats carry this bad reputation, but did you know that bats serve as a beneficial addition and crucial component to many ecosystems? It turns out they aren’t so bad after all. “So why build bat houses?” you may ask. The problem is that bats are experiencing a global decline due to two major threats: roost site disturbance and the narrowing of their feeding habitat. In the tropics, many bats roost in hollow trees. However, through the conversion of forests to agricultural land the number of roosting sites are rapidly declining. Therefore, we want to build bat houses in a tropical region of Nicaragua to combat this threat. The majority of bat species are insectivores. This means that they play an active role in determining how many bugs are in the air and on the ground. Consequently, bats can help manage mosquito populations (a large public health concern), and therefore help farmers with plant growth and health through natural pest management. In addition, a useful product that could result from bat house construction is bat guano (or dung). Bat guano provides a high concentration of nutrients to plants and the surrounding soil due to its high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. The guano can be used or sold as fertilizer to surrounding farms and community members. How We Can Help: Our project involves the construction of bat houses on a permaculture farm to offset bat habitat alteration, support bat education and conservation and provide a natural source of fertilizer for farms. Finca Bona Fide, a pilot farm created through Project Bona Fide, will be the host site for the bat houses. The farm is located on Ometepe Island in Nicaragua. Project Bona Fide is a non-profit organization working toward sustaining culture through organic agriculture, community correlated outreach, and re-forestation projects in Nicaragua. Project Bona Fide focuses on establishing much needed fair trade market opportunities, preserving natural environments, as well as local health and nutrition projects. How We Will Build the Bat Houses: The wood materials needed are:  1/4 sheet of 3/4\" non-treated exterior grade plywood:  This will be cut into a 28\"x24\" sheet for the back of the house, a 15\"x24\" sheet for the front of the house and a 5\"x24\" section for the bottom of the house. 8 foot 1\"x4\" cedar:  We will cut this into different lengths that will make up the two sides, the roof and the predator guard for the bat house.  The image below shows the dimensions of wood after being measured and cut. \n\n\nMeasured and cut wood pieces \n \n\n \n\nBat houses are more experimental in the tropics due to temperature preferences by bats. Therefore, more traditional designs used in North America may not be effective because of specific conditions needed by tropical bats. The success of these houses will depend on finding a balance of varying design elements such as color, ventilation, placement as well as weather and insect resistant material. This is what makes our project unique! We will be painting the houses varying shades of white to light colors to decrease the internal temperatures of the house. Also, the houses will be placed in open areas with limited sun exposure or in locations found to be cooling heat sinks (natural rock or stone buildings) to keep the houses cooler for the bats. To aid in air circulation, we will be adding an increased number of ventilation slots to the side panels and one across the front of the house.  Finca Bona Fide is an organic farm that utilizes alternative ways of growing native plants without the use of pesticides. We will also comply with these chemical-free standards with the construction materials of our houses. The bat houses need to be weather resistant to combat the rainy season in the tropics as well as insect resistant to ensure the longevity of the structure. The cedar we will be using provides both pest and weather resistance naturally without having to be treated. This image shows the finalized design of the bat house. \n\n\nFinished bat house \n \n\n \n\nWe Need Your Support: The kickstarter funding will go towards buying the materials needed for the bat house construction. Following the building of the bat houses, the structures are self-sustaining and can yield very positive results for the farm and region and help improve humans' perception of bats. Help support this symbiotic relationship by providing a way to study optimal bat house design and mounting strategies for this region of Nicaragua! Risks and challenges Unfortunately, because we are working with nature, the main challenge will be testing design elements. It may be up to a year before the bats inhabit the houses. And so ongoing study of bat occupation and design differences in the houses will allow us to discover what design is most functional within the environment over time. Also, obtaining the building materials may be more challenging to do in Nicaragua. But we look forward to working with the local community to learn the most appropriate ways to gain access to them. However, we are confident that we will achieve our goal to construct the houses and maintain our commitment to fulfill all of our rewards. We are excited to tackle any challenges that may come our way! Thanks for your support! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Woodland Banners Poetry Walk is an adventure we want to launch on our land in Saxapahaw, North Carolina. I live there in the woods with artist Steven Durland, who (thanks to a previous successful Kickstarter campaign ) has turned the forest into an art gallery with his Woodland Banners hanging in the trees. \n\n\nA map of the Woodland Banner installation in our woods \n \n\n \n\n\nSome of the banners recall the styles and techniques of famous artists, and he has named them for those artists: \n\n\n\"Leaves After Siqueiros\" \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Leaves After Cezanne\" \n \n\n \n\n\nI got interested in reading what these artists had to say. I found that their words were often as powerful as their images, so much so that they sounded like poetry to me. With a bit of reshaping on my part, the artists’ quotes became poems. I have created a suite of these poems to accompany Steve’s banners, using the artists’ actual words. Here's a bit of Picasso: ...To draw you have to close your eyes and sing.\nInspiration does exist,\nbut it has to find you working.\nLife’s meaning is to find your gift.\nIts purpose is to give it all away.\nGive me a museum and I’ll fill it.... \n\n\n\"Leaves After Picasso\" \n \n\n \n\n\nFor this project we want to raise the funds to print the poems on trail markers and post them along the banner path in our forest. Visitors will follow the path - viewing the banners and reading the poems – up the hill to Steve’s yurt studio, which he calls Bourbon, Dogs & Art (after the three things he loves best). The yurt will be wrapped a colorful new banner bearing poetry fragments. \n\n\nThe yurt studio with its present wrap \n \n\n \n\n\nFinally, the project will be remembered in a full-color paperback book, and a limited-edition hardcover book. The book is among the gifts we are offering those who donate to this project. \n\n\nA mock-up of the book \"Woodland Banner Poetry\" \n \n\n \n\n\nSteve and I have collaborated on a number of creative ventures, all of which have been successful and lived for decades. They include the international quarterly High Performance magazine , the 18th Street Arts Center and Highways Performance Space & Gallery in Santa Monica, the Community Arts Network on the Internet and the nonprofit arts organization Art in the Public Interest . Those projects were devoted to the work of many artists across the world. This year we’re so excited to be creating something of our own. We only need a little help from you to realize this adventure. We so appreciate your donations. And we'd love to have you join us on the Woodland Banner Poetry Walk. Risks and challenges The Woodland Banners are already in place in the woods. The poems have been written. Printing the poems on trail markers and creating the book employ skills we already have and fabricators we trust. We don't see any obstacles other than funding.

    "textDescription": "Story A custom-designed graphic depicting the deep feelings behind the oldest rivalry trophy in college football...in honor of the 40-year keeper of the Little Brown Jug. To honor Jon Falk and his 40 years as the University of Michigan football Equipment Manager, MGoPatio and Jil Gordon have teamed up, with a collection of items for those dedicated to The Little Brown Jug. The \"Home is Where The Jug Is\" design illustrates the loyalty of football fans from Michigan and Minnesota. While versions of the design exist (copyrights and trademarks pending) to represent the Maize & Blue and the Maroon & Gold, this campaign is directed to the Wolverine faithful. In conjunction with this campaign, we have the privilege of being consulted by Greg Dooley of MVictors.com , the premier Jug historian and scholar of all things related to Michigan athletics. \n\n The Little Brown Jug came to be in 1903 and has existed for 110 years. On October 5, 2013, the Wolverines and Gophers play the 100th game in the series and the 94th \"Battle for The Jug.\" Only three of the past 40 years, has The Jug left Ann Arbor, so Jon Falk, has been the de facto \"Keeper of The Jug.\" Hired by Bo Schembechler in 1974 and serving through four decades, Big Jon has dutifully protected the most recognized trophy in college football rivalries. Upon the announcement of his retirement at the end of the 2013 season, we wanted to express our gratitude to Jon in a very special way and give the Michigan faithful an opportunity to be part of \"The Team. The Team. The Team.\" dedicated to The Little Brown Jug.\n \n\nHome is Where The Jug Is. Few people know this better than Jon Falk. We aim to put that sentiment on decals and t-shirts to satisfy our backers and to fund the production of commemorative jugs from Red Wing Pottery, the original maker of the Little Brown Jug, including one special jug for Jon Falk. We have also secured a one hundred-year-old antique five-gallon Red Wing jug to produce an authentic replica (as close as possible) for a very lucky backer. Finally, we plan to apply the extra funds to the hosting of a tailgate reception for Jon Falk at MGoPatio with an invitation-only guest list of Michigan football dignitaries. Every single backer, at every level, will have their name appear on a thank-you card presented to Jon at his reception.\n\n Who else is involved in the project? Greg Dooley (of the MVictors blog ) is an accomplished Jug scholar who has done as much as anyone to recount the lore of The Jug and discover its truths. He informally founded the Brotherhood of The Jug when he publicly recognized the efforts of his readers in the creation of their own Little Brown Jug replicas. Jon Falk will be honored as The Keeper of The Jug and the \"International Brotherhood of The Jug\" will be made real (if only slightly more so than it already was).\n\n \n\n\nJust a few of the LBJ replicas among the Brotherhood (photo courtesy of MVictors.com) \n \n\n \n\nJil Gordon is a professional artist and designer with a personal connection to The Little Brown Jug. Jil has the distinct privilege of painting The Jug , inscribing the year and score each Monday following a Michigan vs. Minnesota contest. She has been a member of the Michigan football family as long as Jon Falk and is responsible for the guest list at Jon's reception. Known for more than her brushwork on The Jug, Jil paints commissioned commemorative game balls and incredible trompe l'oeil murals (jilgordon.com ), both of which she has offered as stretch goal rewards in this project. She has also designed the new IBJ logo that will adorn our HIWTJI t-shirt.\n\n \n\n\nJil works on the classic crock (photo courtesy of MVictors.com) \n \n\n \nSo what are the backer rewards? Every backer, from first to last, will have his or her name included on Big Jon Falk's over-sized thank-you card. At the next level there's a 4\" square silk-screened \"Home is Where The Jug Is\" decal to slap on your wall/laptop/locker/car followed by a HIWTJI t-shirt featuring the new logo for the International Brotherhood of The Jug (honor The Jug in style whether you're a full-fledged member of the IBJ or not). \n\n\nBe The Jug. Hundreds of backer names (hopefully) will come together to form The Jug on Jon's card. \n \n\n \nAt the next level, skip the material goods and concentrate on the experience: be one of ten backers to put your name on the exclusive guest list and join us at the MGoPatio tailgate reception for Jon Falk. Attendance is by invitation only and invitations are being extended to many in the Michigan football family, including several you've seen on the sidelines at the Big House. Go from talking about the history of the Little Brown Jug to living it. Red Wing Pottery in Red Wing, Minnesota, the original makers of the classic rivalry trophy, has agreed to issue an exclusive run of commemorative stoneware jugs. Past and present Red Wing stoneware is regarded as highly collectible and these hand-made pieces will be no exception. The Red Wing kilns no longer fire five-gallon jugs so they will turn out a limited number of one and two-gallon jugs for us. Every specially made piece will bear a mark in honor of the 110 year history of The Jug and the 100th meeting between Michigan and Minnesota. Act quickly and you can pick up one of the first six jugs, in person , at the MGoPatio reception. (A single two-gallon jug and five one-gallon jugs are currently in production at the famed Minnesota pottery.) These distinctly marked six will stand out as some of the rarest stoneware items related to The Jug. (To be clear, the limited and extended run of Red Wing jugs are not painted to match the LBJ. They are glazed and marked with the Red Wing logo, just as the LBJ was before it was made into the rivalry trophy we know today.) Want to visit MGoPatio , but can't make it to the event on September 30th? Come back a few days later and host your own MGoPatio \ntailgate event prior to Michigan's Homecoming game against Minnesota on October 5th. Celebrate the 100th Little Brown Jug game in \nstyle. A backer at this level can invite up to 50 friends to a pre-game \ngathering just 150 yards from the nearest Michigan Stadium seat. Enjoy the patio, a finished garage, and a loft space with full \nbath...all with stadium views. Finally, if the only thing you care to view is little, brown, and shaped like a beehive with a handle...well, we've got you covered. Start a 40-year relationship with a painstaking reproduction of college football's greatest rivalry trophy. Jil Gordon will laboriously recreate The Jug, matching colors and details of the original sideline vessel on a century-old, five-gallon Red Wing jug secured expressly for this project. Celebrate this season and every season by hoisting your own trophy. Amaze your Maize and Blue friends, one-up your neighbor with the Big House-shaped hot tub, or quietly honor the Jon Falk legacy by adopting your own Little Brown Jug. Risks and challenges Backers at the Red Wing jug levels (#5 and #6) should realize that hand-made Red Wing stoneware pieces are highly collectible and production is limited. Red Wing will do what they can to keep up with demand, but the kiln can only turn out so many pieces a month. If demand skyrockets, delivery of these custom jugs may stretch into the spring...or beyond. Rest assured that if it does, we'll keep you informed as to your place in line and the ETA on your jug.\n\nWe're pretty confident in our choice of manufacturer for the decals and t-shirts, but unforeseen circumstances may arise. At worst, delivery is pushed back a short time.\n\nJon Falk has already told his wife about the tailgate reception, so he's as good as there. We have coaches and former players who want to be there too. It would take something otherwordly to stop the event now. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is near completion. Thank you for the support. We will continue to post project updates at www.teslatronix.com  until we have fulfilled all our backers! Once all the obligations to our backers are fulfilled, we will start to offer kits directly from the website.  Stay tuned! \nTrue wireless transmission of power is possible, it is here, and it is simple! Admittedly, the production value of these videos is sub par (all were created as mere demonstrative videos for the public), however the results speak for themselves. All completed Tesla Tronix Tesla coils will have included wooden bases. The coils featured in these videos are for demonstrational purposes only, and are not finished products. \nWhen people think of a Tesla coil, they think of a device that is designed to transmit power wirelessly. The Tesla Tronix Tesla coils, loosly based off a slayer exciter circuit variant require no capacitors, no spark gaps, and no AC power source to function. In  fact, the Tesla Tronix Tesla coils can be powered off almost any DC power source from 5V-35V, with a current draw far less than one amp, and in most cases, between 250ma and 700ma. So what does this mean? Anyone can now fully enjoy and study the properties of a traditional Tesla coil, without the cost and complication in doing so. These Tesla Coils resonate well with LED lighting and Florescent tubing. With proper grounding at the receivers, usable current can be extracted right from the air around you!  \nThe range of these tiny DC, solid state Tesla coils is phenomenal. Be prepared to be able to light florescent tubes from over 5 feet away! \nThere is a wide range of potential applications for such a device, as demonstrated in the following video: \nIn this video, I use a mere 9V battery from my smoke detector to provide candle light in my dining room during the hurricane Sandy power outage this past fall.  So what exactly drives the coil? \nA handful of components are responsible for the \"magic\" behind this circuit.  Any DC source fed to V + and -  as low as 5v 100ma can power these circuits. Let's say you wanted to use your laptop charger to power the coil.  Average current draw from your average 19V laptop charger would be 600mA(or less) at 19V. The charger can provide about 4 amps (depending on the type of laptop charger) but in reality it needs less than one amp. So any DC source to about 30V at 1A can be considered safe with a good heat sink on the transistor. \nThe final product will consist of 5 main components, each will be interchangeable with different lengths of L2.  Toroid: The top load of the solid state Tesla coil. This is the antenna through which the majority of the power will be out-put from. It looks like a coil, however both ends of the wire are soldered together, making sure a voltage difference of 0V across it. The more copper on the toroid, within reason, generally will improve the output distance of the coil. The Tesla coil will in fact function without a torrid, however the output will be dramatically decreased. The wire toroid design may be substituted for one of a more traditional design, or may appear different than in the videos, but will serve the same function in the end. This is also a testament  to the robustness and flexibility of the circuit overall.  L2: The L2 can vary in the number of windings from 500 turns all the way up to 2500 turns and beyond. The more turns on L2, the higher the final output voltage, and the longer range you should expect from your Tesla Tronix Tesla coil. Wire, when stretched out in length, has a resistance. Too many windings,  and the circuit will not perform optimally. 2500 turns is approaching the upper limit, but winding a larger one and experimenting with it couldn't hurt! All Tesla Tronix L2s will be lacquer coated for durability, and to prevent ambient temperature differences from unwinding the coil due to expansion and contraction.  L1: The L1 also dictates the final output of the coil. The fewer the number of windings, the better for this coil. As low as 4 turns on the L1 have been effective with a 2500 turn L2. Too few turns for too large a coil will result in difficulty in getting the circuit to resonate.  The board: As stated previously, the board that drives the entire circuit only consists of 4 main components: A resistor, transistor, and two diodes. There will also be terminals on this board for the connections for V+ and -, L1+ and -, and a terminal for a connection from the base to the bottom lead of L2.  The base: A nice wooden base will be the platform upon which the erected Tesla coil will sit. A notch will be cut into the base so the circuit board can be oriented in such a way to allow a wide range of heatsinks for the transistor.  All complete Tesla Tronix Tesla coils will be fully tested before shipping. Batches of L1s and L2s and toroids will be paired for optimum performance. Considering that any particular board will drive any reasonable combination of L1 and L2, there is no need to have different board types for the different coil combinations.  Each individual component can be manufactured on an individual basis, then mated to the other 4 main components based on the order. A serial number will be assigned to the coil and placed on the 5 major components and the circuit will be ready to ship. For coil/kit combinations, only the L2 will receive a  serial number.  Education These coils are perfect for the educational sector. Students can be instructed to assemble and document their findings related to these devices. The simple construction, design, and low component count achieve exceptional results, yet will engage students directly in a fairly un-known realm of technology.  An anomaly as far as traditional electronics kits are concerned, a new project with exciting (and possibly limitless goals) will easily draw the attention of your physics, math, electrical and general science student. Hobbyist If you or someone you know is an electrical hobbyist of any sort, and are looking for something new, this is the project for you! I have yet to find one instance in where an individual only stopped at one coil. The possibilities are limited to your imagination! Everything will ship from Allentown, PA with all items aquired from the United States and around the world. Your Tesla Tronix Tesla Coil will be hand made in the United States and shipped from north east Pennsylvania. A small friends and family team comprised of engineers and skilled craftsmen is standing by to take initial orders. With your support, we will be able to take our concepts to the next level. DANGER As with any traditional Tesla coil, the risk of minor shocks and burns are present. However, unlike other Tesla coils, this type is safer in the sense that outright electrocution is near impossible. However, This device does operate at frequencies between 540Khz to about 1.5MHz . DO NOT use your Tesla Tronix Tesla coil near any sensitive electronic equipment while in operation, this includes but is not limited to: cell phones, MP3 players, laptops, tablets, cameras, computers or any other low voltage or electrostatic sensitive devices. Tesla Tronix is not responsible for mishap or misuse of this, or related devices. BE WARNED. YOU WILL HAVE FUN with a Tesla Tronix Tesla coil. Risks and challenges We have various distributors from all over the world for the specific components we need, and have tested several of these distributors and have had a 100% success rate for acquired items. In addition, the circuit and its construction are versatile enough that there are several interchangeable components should the supply of one specific component become interrupted. Bulk manufacturing processes for the L2 are ready to go, hand production of the circuit boards can be scaled based upon demand, however this is the internet and the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go astray. Our original group of backers can rest assured that their items will be received within the reasonable time frame allotted, and any setbacks will be directly communicated to all those involved with the project. If the demand exists, TeslaTronix will be continue to produce product on a more sustainable schedule. A website is in the works which will be a portal for all things related to these circuits, and other similar DIY projects!\n\nAgain, these are experimental devices. Extreme caution should be used when developing or running these devices. These devices are not intended to replace any commercially available product, and are for experimental use only.

What are you thinking about as you listen to the music? What do you see? Hearing a song and envisioning something in your mind is an act we all perform daily. Sound is always used to inspire images. INSPIRE X SOUND aims to reverse this process. We create silent aesthetic videos to generate specific feelings and moods, to then be used by electronic music producers as inspiration for an original piece of music. The music and video together will become a piece of experimental creative entertainment. \nThrough this process we explore how numerous producers will differently interpret identical visual prompts, shedding light on the thought process musicians experience between the inception of an idea and the creation of sounds; how each individuals imagination is a direct reflection of one’s own personal experiences and interpretation. \nThe outcome of this project will be a website for the use of showcasing the final videos, along with profiles of the artists who were part of the collaboration.  \nGOAL \nUpon seeing the outcome of each video, new producers and videographers will be inspired to join this community and brand as well as participate in the creation of future content. \nOUR TEAM \nChristine Diamantopoulos: Producer  \nJade Dolan: Co-Producer / Project Supervisor \nMark Martin: Director / Art Director \nClaire Lee: Production Manager  \nMaxime Houde-Shulman: Marketing & Communications Director  \nVanessa Joo: Graphic & Web Designer \nPaul Gauthier: Editor / Post Production Supervisor \nFUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS \n-Cinematographer \n-Colour Correction \n-Equipment \n-Location Permits \n-Talent \n-Props & Costumes \n-Promotional Materials                      \n Risks and challenges We are seven (7) university students in our final year in the RTA School of Media program at Ryerson.

Great subject, great game--I'm looking forward to this!\" - Greg Stafford, the creator of Pendragon Nocturnal Media is proud to present the new tabletop roleplaying game: PALADIN: Warriors of Charlemagne! Written by Ruben in 't Groen and powered by the award-winning and bestselling ruleset from King Arthur Pendragon by Greg Stafford, PALADIN covers the famous exploits of Charlemagne and his loyal friends and warriors, the Paladins of Charlemagne ! \n\n  The corebook and stretch goals include a series of adventures that will take you through the reign of Charlemagne, inspired by the format of the Great Pendragon Campaign!\n\n  With your help, we'll fund the massive corebook (the text manuscript is 708 pages!) and a separate book of adventures! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet in medieval Europe, PALADIN weaves together the historical Carolingian events and the medieval epics of The Matter of France into a single coherent chronology!\n\n  In PALADIN the players play young Frankish squires or knights in the service of one of Charlemagne’s powerful vassals. By going on adventures they will acquire glory and riches, become lords of their own lands, build castles and found their own family. \n\n  Hopefully, the road to fame will lead to the ultimate goal: becoming one of the legendary paladins themselves , along the likes of Roland, Ogier the Dane, Renaud, Oliver, William Shortnose, and others! \n\n\nIn progress art for Paladin by Matthew Ryan \n \n\n \n\n\nPALADIN is a game of medieval fantasy, played using feudal standards of conduct, offering a chance to experience vicariously that long-lost world in both its brutal reality and its fantastic idealism. \n\n  The player characters are knights, with the privileges of elite society and the deadly responsibilities of a warrior. These dualisms – brutal reality versus idealism, and elite privilege versus deadly burden – are the basis for the game. \n\n  PALADIN is a game for knights. It is based on the standards of knighthood found in the original literature about Charlemagne and the paladins (epics such as Song of Roland, Ogier the Dane, Aymon's Four Sons and more). \n\n It is not about magicians, thieves, or scholars. In this game, designed for playing the heavily armed and armored chevaliers of Carolingian literature, knighthood is complex enough!\n\n \n \n\n\nIn progress map - by Colin Driver \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen playing PALADIN , all you need is a twenty-sided dice, and several six-sided dice! It will be intimately familiar to anyone who has played King Arthur Pendragon , as the same rule-set powers both games.\n\n  All skill checks in the game are done by rolling a single twenty-sided dice. If you roll under your Skill rating (a number), you are successful! If you roll equal to your Skill, you've achieved a critical, and if you've exceeded your skill, you've failed!\n\n  Passions and Traits are as important here as in Pendragon, providing more context and depth to your character, while giving mechanical incentives to roleplay and deeply inhabit your character!  New Passions, attitudes and religious magic are added for player characters, created to add more depth to the Charlemagne era! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur stretch goals are straight forward and simple! Every $5,000 we raise over our goal, we'll unlock a new adventure to be delivered in PDF (illustrated below alongside the core rulebook)!\n\n  The adventures are all written and just need to be unlocked so we can illustrate and deliver them!

Stewart had this Kickstarter campaign for PALADIN ready to launch at the time of his death.  His brother Steve Wieck and Stewart’s Nocturnal co-worker Alan Bahr have taken over managing Nocturnal’s publishing projects and will continue to see PALADIN and all existing Nocturnal projects through for the benefit of backers and Stewart’s surviving family.   Though it feels odd and sometimes painful to continue this Kickstarter campaign, both Greg Stafford and his King Arthur Pendragon game were beloved by Stewart, and we want to honor Stewart’s love for both by seeing this epic, Pendragon-based title through to publication. Your help would be appreciated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the campaign, we'll make updates and notes about our progress here! In Update 8, we showed the Table of Contents for PALADIN! It gives a great look at what the game will include and what our focus is! In this update, we talk about how PALADIN is different from PENDRAGON mechanically! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges Q: Can Nocturnal Media handle this project?\nSimply put yes. We're a company with decades of industry experience backing us, with names like Steve Wieck, Greg Stafford, and more providing support throughout this project. You will get your book.\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished? \nA: The edited text of all the rules is 100% done. The only outstanding piece is art, which we need your help to complete. \n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms Nocturnal Media? \nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we're not aiming to overload this project with excess things. All our stretch goals are written.\n\nQ: What about delays in art? \nA: We've already began to contract out the art, and some of the art is already here. Isn't it great? We're really happy with our artists. If there's a delay on the art, we have back-up artists we've already done test runs and are ready to work with.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs? \nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and so, we'll be handling shipping in BackerKit after the project is ready to ship. It'll be easier on everyone that way.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals? \nA: The core game is written, and the team is in constant communication. If the worst should happen, we'll be prepared to continue forward and we have multiple redundancy plans in place. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it came about? The whole idea of the “Versa-Tool” came about one evening when I was looking for a bottle opener to enjoy a cold beverage. I got frustrated looking around my house for one and ended up using a table to crack my bottle open.  You can imagine, the old lady wasn’t too stoked about the mark.   After that I started looking for a better, more available bottle opener.  All I found on the market were gimmicks with flip flops, and belt buckles, but nothing practical I can just take with me and go. I wanted to create something with purpose, that I wouldn’t mind carrying with me. Personally, I cannot stand things on my key chain, so I knew that wasn't an option. Then I realized that I always, no matter what the occasion, have my wallet with me. Then came the Versa-Tool. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was in the garage developing this product, and got my first prototypes in, and they packaged them up really well.  Went to grab a box cutter and had another epiphany.  Most of us are using this hazardous tool just to cut through tape.  Why not create a safe alternative I can have in my pocket so when I get my packages I can open them without bringing out the ninja weapons.  That’s how we came about the box opener aspect of the Versa-Tool. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work? The Versa-Tool is a utility tool that can be used as a straight edge, ruler, bottle opener, ice scraper, and box opener.  The great thing about it is that it can do all of these things, and you probably won’t even notice that you have it.  It’s the same size as a credit card, and will slide into your wallet or money clip with ease and will be ready for a lifetime of use.  You’ll never need to search around your house for these utilities again \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign: Design was one of the most important aspect of this tool because just like everyone else I’m sick of adding stuff to my key chain, wallet or just my pocket in general.  I had to develop a form factor that was modern, sleek, lightweight, strong, and most importantly, functional.  While researching materials I ran into a twill weave carbon fiber that definitely had the aesthetic I was looking for.  Then after several design prototypes, we developed the most functional and durable and safest product on the market.   We took the final product through hours of stress testing, and notice that it maintains it’s form factor without bending or becoming inconvenient for you to carry with you at all times.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction: We tested out aluminum and some other light-weight materials, but I wanted the product to be durable, enough to withstand heavy, long term use.   Then I ran into a high Grade 3k 2x2 Twill Weave Carbon Fiber. This material is ridiculously strong and surprisingly lightweight at just .03 oz.  You virtually add nothing to your wallet and gain so much. High Strength; Fire Resistant; Fatigue Resistant; Dimensionally Stable. \n\nRather than cutting corners and having a carbon fiber mold injection, this product is CNC machined to provide a more stable and durable product. \n\n\n\n\nBox Opener \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nRuler or straight edge \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nRuler \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nSuper thin and unbelievably strong \n \n\n \n\nTENSILE STRENGTH / DENSITY / SP. STRENGTH CARBON FIBER     3.50 / 1.75 /2.00 STEEL                    1.30 / 7.90 / 0.17 As you can see, Carbon Fiber has a tensile strength almost 3 times greater than steel, yet 4.5 times less dense. \n\n\nWeight of the Versa-Tool \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nAverage weight of a wallet \n \n\n \n\n\nSpecs: Size: Height: 3  ⅜  in  or 85.60 mm Width:  2 ⅛ in or 53.98 mm Thickness: .059\" \nFunctionality:  Creating something that started out fulfilling one need, I wanted to add as much functionality as possible, and that’s why it’s not just a bottle opener.  I’ve tested the product as a ruler, straight edge, and box opener as well.  You’d be surprised at how many times this comes in use. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigns: Here are the designs that we started with and how we got to the design we did today. \n\n\nFirst Renderings \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nPhotoshop Render \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Physical product \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFirst Carbon Fiber prototype \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFinal Product \n \n\n \n\nManufacture: Our manufacture is standing by and watching the kickstarter. Once the kickstarter has reached the set goal the manufacture will go ahead and start producing the Versa-Tool, even before the kickstarter has ended. We are still in testing stage to make sure that these will be 100% perfect on the day you receive them. In 2 weeks these will be ready to be to roll. We use CNC machines to cut out the carbon fiber and not mold injections. This provides alot stronger and stable product. Patent Pending! Production Timeline: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping: USA Shipping is FREE, International shipping is $5. Team Members: Travis Leslie: Founder/Lead Designer Garrett Robertson: Photographer Danish Ishaq: Marketing Visit our website Functionalbydesign.net Get your Versa-Tool just in time for Christmas! They're great stocking stuffers as well. Risks and challenges The major challenge with this product was to go from development to production, and getting this product in front of peoples faces. Through the prototype process I would show people the product, and they would inevitably fall in love. Then again, these are friends and family. I needed to get the versa tool in front of the masses, that means creating a comprehensive marketing plan and budget. \n\nAnother risk/challenge is manufacturing. Of course when you develop a product that is high quality, the costs associated increase and we're at the highest tier of production per piece. Getting more orders will allow us to take the cost of production per unit down because we refuse to sacrifice quality materials. Like anything else you have to find a reliable source to produce your product, and we have finally created that relationship. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story This is a Kickstarter campaign for the Euro Edition of Chimera Station, the game of space station construction in which genetic experimenting on aliens is not only allowed but strongly encouraged in order to win! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to develop a Euro Edition of the game with language independent module tiles, game board and player boards, and rules translations in as many European languages as possible. In order to do so, we need funds and translators to design the right iconography and translate the rulebook and the perk cards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To add a pledge level for your language in this Kickstarter campaign, go to ourBoardGameGeek poll and vote for your language. As soon as we get to 10 votes for any given language we will create the associated pledge level.  Voting on BGG will be closed on April, 20th. In case we reach 50 backers for your language, then that language is unlocked and we will deliver it to all backers of this language. English, German, French and Dutch are unlocked languages, even without 50 backers, as we've received enough intrest from distributors for these languages. If a language has less than 50 backers at the end of the campaign (and it's not German, French or Dutch), we will deliver you the English version.  (Of course it's always possible to cancel your pledge before the end of the campaign if you don't want an English version.) Do you think you would be a good translator ?  Don't hesitate to send us a message!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the box you will find: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Euro Edition will have all language dependent components in up to 4 languages in 1 box. Here's an example of 8 of the redesigned Modules:  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what they all symbolise (Clockwise from top left): \n\nAutosurgeon: Pay 2 coins to attach any 1 component from the supply to this worker.  \nCovert Cloning: Gain 1 component from the supply for each worker in the worker lounge.  \nDispatch Station: Recall one of your workers. Workers here cannot be recalled or displaced.  \nMedical bay: Trade 1 unattached component from your supply for any 2 components.  \nUnderground Lab: Detach any number of components from this worker. Advance on the research track for each component detached.  \nCatering Service: Copy the effect of an occupied module. Pay food equal to the point value of that module.  \nSymposium: Gain 1 food. Gain 1 additional food for every 2 levels of research you have achieved.  \nShopping Center\t: Gain 2 coins per worker on adjacent modules. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimera Station is a game for 2 to 4 players which will take 60 to 90 minutes to play. It is easy to learn but hard to master. Players have five rounds to build the Space Station, which would be nearly impossible if they were using regular alien workers. Thankfully extra tools to enhance the aliens are at hand: brains, tentacles, claws and leaves. Each round is made up of three phases : \nThe placement phase , where workers are assigned various tasks or prepared for splicing. \nThe splicing phase , where prepped workers are upgraded with new genetic components and then sent to fulfill one of the leftover tasks available. \nThe feeding phase , in which workers are rewarded with food (space hamburgers). \n So how does this \"splicing\" work? Let's listen to someone educated in the matter ... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to find out more about the game, feel free to download the full rules (in English) by clicking on the link below. This rulebook does not have the language independent components that will be in the final product. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There is also an opportunity to play the game on Tabletopia : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFor those of you who prefer a visual aid when discovering new games we have this great video by Rahdo from Rahdo runs through. \n\n\nSo far for the how to play. Let's listen to some people who already played the game! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Here's what Man vs Meeple  thinks about the game: \n\n\nFinal thoughts on the game by Rahdo (Rahdo runs through ): \n\n\nAnd UndeadViking did a great review as well: \n\n\nAll of the above reviews were made based on the prototype of the original TMG retailer version of the game. Components will vary in the Euro Edition. The module tiles will be made language independent with clear icons. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe think of the unlocking of the languages as our stretch goals. Once we reach 50 backers for any given language, production is unlocked and the language will be included in the Euro Edition. Probably some or most of you were expecting some kind of extra components or mini-expansions or the likes? We're afraid those were lost in some black hole along the way so we will not be doing any of those. Why is this great news? It means we will be able to deliver the game to you at a good price  (MSRP will be €55) and in time .  The estimated delivery date is September 2017. LANGUAGE UPGRADE KIT Some European citizens backed the American Edition by Tasty Minstrel Games in 2016. As requested by some of those backers, we provide a language upgrade kit . Basically this is exactly the same box, but without the plastic meeples. Provided we reach enough backers for their language , people who choose this reward, will receive a box in their language with: \nTranslated rulebook \nTranslated perk cards \nLanguage independent module tiles \nLanguage independent gameboard \nLanguage independent player mats \nThe cardboard food and money tokens (as they are part of the same punchboards) \n In the pledge manager (after the KS campaign), you will be asked to choose your language. You'll have the choice between all the languages that we reached at least 50 backers for. Shipping cost of the language upgrade kit is the same as the shipping cost of the regular rewards and will be added in our pledge manager. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supernova pledge level might deserve a bit more love and attention than the small block of text in the pledge level bar on the right hand side. By pledging at this level you will get the following: \n\nOne copy of Chimera Station - Euro Edition in your language. In case your language doesn't get produced this becomes an English copy. \n\none copy of ALL our funded future Kickstarter games (at base pledge level). \nOur galactic gratitude for supporting us and having faith in the future of our company. \n The shipping cost for Chimera Station - Euro Edition is included in the Supernova pledge level. The shipping cost of your future rewards is not. In case you want to upgrade your base pledge level for one of our future games to a higher level (if applicable) you will be given this opportunity at that time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping is not  included in your pledge level (except for Supernova pledge) and will be added in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended. We decided to do just three different rates: \nPick-up at one of our pick-up points: FREE \n \nBelgium: €5 \nRest of Europe: €7 \n Please note that we will not ship outside of Europe. Taxes:  As we ship from the European Union, there will be no import taxes or handling costs for EU backers.  Backers from European countries outside of the European Union (Russia, Turkey, Ukrain, etc) have to take into account that import taxes may be applicable and are to be fulfilled by the backer. Group pledges: If you want to do a group pledge, just multiply the right amount by the number of copies you wish to order. Shipping will only be added in the pledge manager for 1 copy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you represent a board game store (brick & mortar) or board game club? Then Game Brewer probably wants you as a pick-up point. Contact us for more information on the special offer we can give you. We already have some pick-up points but are aiming at having more all over Europe. This is the current list of all possible pick-up points: Belgium: \nBoard game store de Kolonisten (Turnhout) \nBoard game store Worlds' End Comics (Gent) \nBoard game club Spelen op Zolder (Zedelgem) \nBoard game club de Pionisten (Vichte) \nBoard game club de Spelhamels (Beerse) \nEvent: Spellenfestival (October 1st, Bilzen) \n Germany: Event: Spiel '17 (hall 2) (October 26th-29th, Essen) Netherlands: \nEvent: Ducosim Zomerbeurs (September 23rd, Amersfoort) \nEvent: Spellenspektakel (November 11-12, Eindhoven) \n Spain: Board game store Dungeon Marvels (Barcelona) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have special deals for retailers who want to stock Chimera Station - Euro Edition and order before the end of this campaign. And we have very special deals for retailers that want to become one of our pick-up points in Europe. Register on www.gamebrewer.com  and find out more about our special offers. SaveSave Risks and challenges We learned a lot from our first project, Pixie Queen, which will reach our backers in June. A lot of things we did not anticipate to take as long as they did eventually led to delays. It was our maiden voyage. We learned. We will do our utmost best to avoid the same obstacles and deliver our future projects in time.\n\nChimera Station (deluxe edition) was already Kickstarted late 2016 by Tasty Minstrel Games (TMG). We would like to point out that this Kickstarter campaign is not associated in any way with TMG's Chimera Station's Kickstarter campaign.\n\nGame Brewer acquired the exclusive rights for the retail version of this great game for the whole of Europe and this campaign is intended to assess in which languages we should produce the game and collect funds to develop language independent components.\n\nThe games themselves will be produced in Europe, with the exception of the plastic components which will be produced by Panda Games in China.\n\nFeel free to ask us any questions you might have, we will make sure to answer you asap.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kickstarter is over, but you can still get info and BUY from the Loud Bicycle website .  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want biking on roads to be safer \nCycling in traffic can be frightening and dangerous. The Loud Bicycle horn prevents accidents by alerting motorists with a familiar sound. The safety benefits of the horn give more people the confidence to travel by bike. How does it work? Drivers react to car horns before they even know where the sound is coming from. A driver that gets beeped at while backing out of a driveway for example, will immediately brake. These kinds of reflexive reactions are perfect to keep cyclists safe.\nSome motorists don't realize that their driving habits can be dangerous for cyclists. Drivers will learn to be more aware of cyclists after a Loud Bicycle horn is honked at them. Click to hear a recording of the horn: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures \n\nSound: is like a typical car horn, both in volume and pitch \n\nHonk:  for up to 30 seconds at a time (but please be respectful)  \n\nBatteries: are rechargeable Li-ion batteries, a charge lasts 1-2 months \n\nButton:  snaps on to either handlebar and honking does not interfere with braking. \n\nWeather resistant: works in rain, sleet and snow\n \n \nOther rewards \n\n\n\n\nMake the Rhinocyclist happy and get a T-Shirt \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nShow your support for bike-friendly cities with Loud Bicycle stickers. \n \n\n \n\n\nDetailed specs \nThe Loud Bicycle horn is truly in a class of its own, here are a few more technical specs: \n\n\nVolume: 112 decibels, like a typical car horn\n \n\nPitch: just like a compact car, low tone 420 Hz, high tone 500 Hz \n\nRemovable batteries: so you can charge them indoors \n\nBattery status light: will indicate when the battery is low \n\nDisable the horn: discretely when it is parked with a hidden switch \n\nDimensions: less than 6x4.5x4 inches \n\nWeight: less than 23 ounces\n \n\nSilicone rubber gaskets:  specially molded for water ressistance \nPatent pending \n \n\n\n\nCloseup of the horn button, honk while braking and steering. \n \n\n \n\nAbout us \nInventor Jonathan Lansey is a research engineer, an Awesome Foundation trustee and an avid city cyclist. Andrew Lansey is a mechanical and aerospace engineer, who has taken a break from airplane building to design the aerodynamic horn prototypes.We have been working with a US manufacturing and engineering firm that has extensive experience designing and building hardened, waterproofed electronics. We are also working with an overseas firm to source some components and do the final assembly. We have a fulfillment company lined up to get your rewards to you as soon as production is complete. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended team: \n\nEngineering Mark Gibson, Ilya Lifshits, Eric JonesVisuals Filmography/photography by Rocky Acosta and Daniel Martín Alarcón, web design by Allison Johnston and logo by Andrew Le. Our T-Shirt image was drawn by Allison Johnston, and with inspiration from this painting by Ellen Marcus.We are really grateful for all the help we have received: Kara Brickman, Jared Detsikas, Eli Lansey, Lily Peck, Nathan Schurr, Ofer Tamir, Christina Xu, Mitch Altman, Spencer Boomhower, Sergey Galkin Erhardt Graeff, Luke Hutchison, Randall Jacobs, Sam Kapala, Stacy Lansey, Jordan Ledvina, Ilya Lifshits, Ian Marge, Nadeem Mazen, Peter Montgomery, Boris Mordkovitch, Jon Pierce, Reuben Pressman, Suzanne Segalowitz, Jesse Taggert, Taylor Welden, Jun Yin, Artisans Assylum, Bike Gotham, Revolights, The Awesome Foundation, Bob and Lill Lansey\n\n Production plan Our timeline has been thoroughly planned and reviewed by the firms we are working with. All we need is your support! \n\n\nJan: Finalize design and components \n\nFeb: Test prototypes of final design \n\nMar: Finalize and order production tooling \n\nApr: System validation of beta units and shipping to BETA backers \n\nMay: Final production run \n\nJun: Package and ship horns to you! \n The money you pledge will go to engineering, fabrication and testing. With your help we can make cycling safer. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! www.LoudBicycle.com , @LoudBicycle , FB: LoudBicycle \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Noise pollution:\nSome are concerned about increased noise pollution from cyclists and a deterioration of the urban environment. The Loud Bicycle horn is not a toy. We are confident that people serious enough about cycling to buy one of our horns are already more concerned about the urban environment than an average motorist. In addition, the uninterrupted path from horn to ear will be a strong motivation for our customers to honk responsibly. \n\nReckless cycling:\nWe are anticipating concerns that the Loud Bicycle horn will encourage cyclists to ride more dangerously and take more risks, feeling that the horn will protect them. We will be be including a user manual in the box which will include easy-to-understand instructions for safe city cycling. We also strongly encourage all bike riders to follow the traffic laws in the cities where they ride. While following these norms, the horn will only be used in emergency situations that could not have been avoided.\n\nBattery quality:\nLithium ion batteries come with varying levels of reliability. We have experienced extremely good results with our prototypes, and are confident that we have sourced high-quality batteries. Additionally, we will perform extensive testing to ensure that our bulk order has no flaky batteries.\n\nFulfillment:\nThere is a risk that the final production and shipment will be delayed, but we’re tenacious and determined to stick to our intended timeline and honor commitments made to campaign supporters. Additionally, our manufacturer specializes in runs our size, so we don't expect any major delays there, and the fulfillment company we are working with will get your rewards on their way as soon as they come out of the factory.

As we have partnered with great manufacturers in Dongguan, China, we are ready to begin the production run as soon as the project is funded. Do note that this is the first time we handle such a large quantity through an international channel. Although there could be unexpected factors that result in a delay, we already signed agreements with manufacturers, suppliers and shipping handlers, and will do our best to ensure the Vince Durden backpacks get into your hands as soon as possible.\n\nThe main future challenge we are facing is International Shipping. International shipping is normally expensive and slow. In addition, the amount of time customs and border clearance take is unpredictable. To be prepared, we will start shipping some of the rewards over as soon as the campaign is funded; by the time the campaign ends, we will have sufficient experience dealing with international shipping.

    "textDescription": "Story Over two years in the making, Mint playing cards are finally available now on Kickstarter. Luxury for the modern cardician. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Design \n\n\nA merger of form and function \n \n\n \n\n\nWe wanted to create a worker's deck. A pack of 52 cards that merges form with function. Using a classical approach to design, the goal was to develop a look that is familiar, but fresh. The elegant repeating pattern evokes the decks that have survived the test of time. Black Mint Playing Cards are luxury for the modern cardician. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling \n\n\nBlack Mint will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock. \n \n\n \n\n\nAfter we established the look, we focused on the feel. The true mark of a card is how it handles. The Black Mint deck will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock available. It will be coated with the legendary Air Cushion Finish to provide for the smoothest spread, fans, and shuffles.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Faces \n\n\nClassic court cards with a modern touch of MINT. \n \n\n \n\n\nEverything about the Black Mint Deck is custom. The faces include custom fonts, pips, court cards, and Ace of Spades,  but we were careful to maintain the classic playing card look that we have all grown to recognize and love. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Magicians, for Magicians \n\n\nThe back design features an intuitive marking system for magicians to take clever advantage of. \n \n\n \n\n\nOur goal is to create harmony between the card and the cardician. Black Mint playing cards are a tool; and like great magic, they hide their best kept secret in plain sight. An innovative marking system opens up and endless world of possibilities. We have also included several gaff cards to help you perform special effects that you couldn't with an average deck. Extra Cards Include a double backer and a double facer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Edge 52' Online Instructional Course \n\n\nEach deck comes with an instructional course teaching you powerful effects with your deck. \n \n\n \n\n\nStudents of 52Kards know that we are also invested in the education of magic. Each Black Mint deck will come bundled with a free in depth instructional course that will teach you how to effectively use the built in marking system and included gaff cards. The course will also cover the use of a variety of other gimmicks in card magic. The course will include chapters on the use of marked cards, duplicate cards, double backers, double facers, short cards, tapered cards, crimped cards, and more. If you have been learning magic and sleight of hand technique from 52Kards.com  or the 52Kards Youtube channel , then you will LOVE this course. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Mint Many backers have been asking if we will eventually produce a Mint deck that has a colored back design. This has been our intention all along as The Mint Collection is meant to be a complete line of playing cards with the Black Mint being the launch edition. The next edition we have planned is the Raspberry Mint deck (think the Black Mint deck, except in a beautiful shade of red), and we were originally going to release it next year sometime... However, due to the massive success of this project we are getting the Raspberry Mints printed at the same time as the Black Mints! \n\n\nA mockup of the Raspberry Mint Deck. The exact shade of red may be subject to change. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nIf this stretch goal is reached, then backers will be given the opportunity to choose how many Black Mint decks and how many Raspberry Mint decks they want to get with their pledged money.   \nRaspberry Mints will also be available as a $10 add on.\nThey will NOT be limited, and will continue to be sold at 52Kards.com after they are printed.  \n The cards and tuck boxes will include all of the same features as the Black Mint deck (markings system, custom seal, embossed/foiled box, gaff cards, etc).  \n Once the campaign is over we will be sending out a survey to all of the backers and you will be given the opportunity to add any additional decks to your reward package. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Limited Edition We have a BIG update to the Black Mint Playing Cards Kickstarter project! In order to celebrate the massive support the project has already received we are introducing a new LIMITED EDITION Black Mint Deck! It's a beautiful tri-color design with gold line accents on a borderless card(see the picture below to behold it's full glory!). The borderless back is perfectly suitable for the Black Mint design and the touch of gold adds a rich aesthetic to the pattern. \n\n\nA beautiful tri-color design with gold line accents on a borderless card. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLimited Edition Black Mint. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLimited Edition & standard Black Mints Limited Edition & standard Black. \n \n\n \n\n\nHere's a few important points: \n\nThe Limited Edition Black Mint will be available exclusively through this Kickstarter project and will never be for sale again after the campaign is over. The regular Black Mint cards will be available at 52Kards.com once they are printed; although Kickstarter backers will be getting them sooner and at a discounted price.  \n The Limited Edition decks cost $15 each. To reserve your decks, simply add $15 to your pledge per deck. We will send out a survey at the end of the campaign to find out exactly what you want your pledged money to go towards.  Each person is allowed to purchase a maximum of 6x decks per person. We will strictly be enforcing this rule to keep these decks truly limited in nature.  \n The intuitive Mint Marking System will still be included in the Limited Edition decks.  \nWe are keeping the tuck box design a surprise for now, but trust us when we say it's going to be especially handsome.  \n\nLimited Edition Black Mints are only available to backers of this project. After March 2nd you will no longer be able to become a backer.   \n  If you don't know how to manage your pledge and add more money to your contribution you can see this video for more information: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Ons Black Mint Deck - $10 per deck Raspberry Mint Deck - $10 per deck Limited Edition Black Mint Deck - $15 per deck Mint Stripper Deck - $15 per deck Black Mint Uncut Sheet - $40 each Raspberry Mint Uncut Sheet - $40 each Limited Edition Uncut Sheet - $50 each \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree USA Shipping when you get 6 decks or more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you like to add extra rewards to your pledge level? Click this video to see how. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The only challenge is getting enough funding to get the decks printed. The United States Playing Card Company requires a minimum order of 2,500 decks in order for them to print your design. As you can imagine, this amounts to a large amount of money, which is why we are asking for your support in this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nEverything else is ready to go. Once we have the funds we will be ready to print. Your rewards will be sent to you as soon as production is complete, which we expect to be in June of 2016 (hopefully sooner).

We had a blast in 2013, our first year at the Kessler, and this year we have another amazing show planned.   \nTake the time this Christmas season to enjoy those things that make the season so special: spending time with our friends and family, enjoying the holiday spirit and being thankful. We hope you will join us and become a Holiday Experience 2014 Kickstarter. What better way is there to be energized and filled with the Christmas spirit than enjoying amazing music? It's only through your support that we can share our music.  \nThe Holiday Experience started off as a small house concert gathering of friends about five years ago and is now coming to the Historic Kessler Theater in Oak Cliff on December 23, 2014 at 6:00 pm and 9:00 pm. We’ve put together an amazing show of jazz, gospel, R&B and classical music with an all-star lineup of musicians including John Holiday, Neeki Bey, Kristin Yost, S-Ankh Rasa, Shelley Carrol and more. Make the Holiday Experience your Holiday tradition. \n Risks and challenges One challenge is putting together a concert that’s not connected with a school or church on the night before Christmas Eve. Another risk is fronting the costs of rental for the theater and musicians fees. We’ve assembled a great volunteer team of business people, marketing and social media gurus, music directors and musicians who are committed to the mission of putting together an amazing concert. With the dedication of our team and through the generosity of all of our wonderful supporters, the Holiday Experience 2014 will be a special holiday gift for the community.

Wow! \n\n\nRabbit page ornament original art $45 Reward Level \n \n\n \nPerks of funding a print edition: \nBackers have the option of having their copy signed and sketched in with their very own little ghost mouse! \n30 copies will be donated to animal welfare!  With the original campaign we donated two illustration pages to Central Texas SPCA for fundraising.

If the funding goal isn’t met, the project ends and no money changes hands. Stretch Goals? I have nibbled my funding goal down to the bare minimum because I REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN!  If we make funding, my primary stretch goal would be to increase the print run, so... $5200 Stretch Goal - Increase the print run.  Donate 100 copies to Animal Welfare fundraising.

While the digital rewards for Magician's Cat ran over schedule, I kept backers fully informed and provided a bonus PDF of children's coloring pages as a thank you for their patience.\n\nFor this project, I've completed the book and illustrations and only require some time to do prepress preparations. My budget on printing and rewards delivery is based on my experience with my previous projects and printing estimates from the local Austin printer who worked with me on The Stolen Child Tarot. Should any unforeseen delays happen (mechanical issues, rescans on artwork...) I promise to keep backers up to date. \n\nThe Kickstarter community has allowed me to do some amazing things as an independent artist and I take my commitment to you very seriously.

Back in 2015, they started designing a dive watch that combined vintage style with modern technology. After nearly two years of research, they finally found the perfect solution. Now we are proud to announce DARK SEA 500m.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESIGN What is and always will be the great mission of this watch? It is built for your exploration. It will be reliable in any conditions and carry time in dark sea. DARK SEA 500m is born for the following goals: STYLISH More than a tool watch, DAKR SEA 500m comes with vintage and stylish appearance that could become your daily dress code for any occasions. Inspired by the vintage dive watch, it has a very rare shape and highly polished surface that contrasts to round-brushed bezel. The dial makers are large and clear to see. The second hand has two luminous dots filled with Super Luminova BGW9 and Super Luminova Red respectively. Super Luminova Red will glow pink in dark. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n COMFORTABLE To us, your wearing experience is important. The dimension of watch will finally determine the real experience of wearing. Giving that the 316L stainless steel case has 45mm diameter, 15.4mm thickness and wearable 50mm from lug to lug, it looks tough and handsome but wearable and comfortable on wrist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PROFESSIONAL To us, the watch must be reliable and durable in all weathers and be easy to read time even under dark sea. Powered by SEIKO NH35 automatic movement and made in 316L stainless steel, DARK SEA 500m is built for saturation diving. It has 500m/1640ft water resistance. It also has helium escape value system that allows helium or hydrogen to escape when the divers are going back to surface. We also emphasizes on handling. Oversized 7.5mm screw-down crown is very easy for adjusting time. It also has 120-click bezel that rotates very smooth in use. And highly legible BGW9 dial and markers never let you lose yourself and continue your journey. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Dark Sea 500m comes with two versions: Cool Steel, which is all stainless steel model; and Black Storm, which features DLC coated brushed bezel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIMELINE \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARRANTY Each DARK SEA 500m comes with a warrant card that covers 1 year warranty for your own DARK SEA 500m.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nCidergrass 2016 \n \n\n \n\n\nGoal Update! We just had one of the best weekends imaginable, all thanks to YOU! Playing on KGNU Saturday morning was a total blast, and the Stem Ciders show/beard shaving was one heck of a party! AND, we achieved our initial campaign goal of $15,000! We are beyond grateful and so humbled by all of your support. THANK YOU for keeping up with this project, supporting it and sharing it with your friends. You all are seriously amazing. You have enabled us to make this album the way that we want to, without compromising any part of the process. Your support has allowed us to believe in ourselves even more than before and we know that there's even more that we can achieve. We are hoping to continue the project funding to reach our \"stretch\" goal of $23,000 to accomplish some great additions we have listed below. We know that these things will help us get the music out to more people, and we also have an additional reward to offer everyone here to show our immense appreciation. 1) Promotion and Publicity: Without this, most albums only get regional exposure driven by grassroots efforts. Establishing a publicity budget will enable us to market this project the right way, hit some major press outlets and hopefully get the album some airtime! Our initial Kickstarter budget was 100% focused on the music and didn't allow for this. We would love to get the album out there for more people to experience and enjoy! 2) Professional Video Production: This is another aspect of the project that we initially chose to set aside so that we could allocate all the funds towards a high quality recording process. We would like to record a music video and get some live footage from some of our great gigs coming up this summer. Video can be even more impactful than audio and using it to promote and support the album has always been on our minds. We want to make it a reality. 3) Vinyl Album Release: Everyone knows that a good vinyl record sounds amazing, and we know our album would benefit greatly from this format. The challenge is that a vinyl release is extremely expensive: It requires a separate 24bit mastering process, lacquer cutting, and pressing. But think about this: The album was recorded in one of the best studios with amazing production and engineering, using top of the line gear, and features some beautiful vintage instruments. We know that the album will be really fun to listen to in the higher resolution inherent to vinyl and we really want people to have the opportunity to hear that! We have a new reward category that allows you to order a record + more for $35 if we reach our stretch goal. If you're a current backer already, you can add a vinyl record to your existing reward for $25 (just \"change your pledge\" on your current reward) If you'd like to help us take this thing to the next level, here's an easy address to share this project: www.getlonesome.com. And, if you're a vinyl lover like we are, reserve a copy as it'll be a limited pressing if we make the stretch goal! We can't thank you all enough! See you soon. Jonny, Sam, Bradley & Todd About Us  From our first months as a band, we've wanted to record our songs in a way that represents them in the best way possible. We knew that we couldn't do it right away, so we took a couple of years to hone in our sound, and write more music. We've played all around our great state of Colorado, took 2nd place in the 42nd annual Telluride Bluegrass Festival band competition, 1st in the 2016 UllrGrass competition, and we became a band that is confident of what we can deliver! We feel very fortunate to be in a band with our best friends, making music that we love - and we are so excited to share it with all of you!  Costs  In order to make a great album, we knew we needed a great studio and a great team. We recorded at the renowned Etown Studios in Boulder, CO and enlisted the help of some people that we deeply respect: Sally Van Meter (Producer), James Tuttle (Engineer), and David Glasser (Mastering). The album has been tracked and is going into mixing, so as a backer at $10 or more, you can expect to get the music much sooner than if we were only starting from scratch today.  There are lots of bills to cover when making an album like this. We have been strategic, calculated and responsible with our decisions and spending, and will continue to be. It is equally important to us to provide everyone with the highest quality recording possible. We've been saving money since we formed the band, but we really need your help to make this album come to fruition. Producing, recording, mixing, mastering, printing, album art, publicity, and Kickstarter costs are all key steps in the process, and they add up quickly. Rewards The great thing about the Kickstarter format is that when you back a project, you get cool rewards in return! We are offering the standard rewards like CDs, hats, t-shirts, etc. But we also wanted to provide you with a chance to get to know us better as people, not just performers. You can have Jonny write a song based on a personal experience, or about someone you care about. Bradley will take you out for a fancy dinner. Sam will hand build you a picture frame to display hand written lyrics, or even a coffee table! Todd and Jonny will come to your house and cook for you and some friends. We aren't just asking for your help, we want to get to know you and offer rewards that truly show our gratitude. NOTE: If you are feeling extra generous and see a reward you like, but would like to pay more than the listed price, you can do that. We won't complain ;) High Stakes Kickstarter has an all-or-nothing policy that requires us to make or exceed our goal in order to receive any of the contributions. If we don't succeed, all money is returned to the donors. We only have 30 days to get this thing done, so your help is critical in making the project a reality! Any amount that you can contribute is so much appreciated. Please help us get the word out by sharing this page, or our video, on Facebook! THANK YOU!!! We are SO thankful for all of our fans, friends & family and are beyond grateful that you are interested in helping us make our first record! Make sure to have a look at the different award levels, as we tried really hard to have a variety of things that everyone can enjoy. The album and merchandise created through this campaign will have new branding and is being created just for this project - you will be helping to create all of this and will receive these items hot off the presses! This is your chance to really help set our trajectory by growing the band as a business with a brand, products to sell, and some new music. We're so excited to have you all along for the ride and we fully understand that our success depends on you.  Our sincerest thanks, Jonny, Todd, Sam & Bradley The Lonesome Days Risks and challenges Every project like this has its risks and challenges, and we are confident that we are taking all of the right steps to ensure a successful and high quality project. \n\nOur success will be ensured by the strong team we've put together and the great working relationships we have. Our producer, Sally Van Meter, has produced a countless number of amazing albums. We are leaning on her experience to ensure we cover all of our bases, and complete this process the right way. Our engineer, James Tuttle, is a studio veteran, and his calm mastery of the trade is inspiring to watch. We know that he will get the most out of this recording, and have us sounding as good as we possibly can. David Glasser's mastering work is known and respected nation wide, and we couldn't be more excited to start working with him. We also have many experienced friends and colleagues supporting us behind the scenes. \n\nWe know our songs have great potential, and that with this team in place, and a whole lot of elbow grease, we will walk away with the best album possible. Literally, the only risk to this project is being able to fund it through to completion. We are confident that with the help of you and our amazing team that we can lead this project to be 100% successful. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out to any of us in the band or email us at lonesomedays@gmail.com. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story 'Lose Like a Human' is a 2017 science-fiction short-film about a chess match between a chess AI and his human creator. The film takes the form of a dialogue between the two players, surrounded by a group of spectators that seek some answer about their humanity in the pair's discussion. Our projected budget roughly breaks down as follows: 1. £200, for further equipment expense which we now require next to our established kit.  2. £400, for location management. This is the bulk of what is required for our campaign. The current plan is a two-day shoot, set in the function room (i.e. ballroom) of a bar.   3. £150, for festival entry expenses. Our goal is to enter the film into both independent festivals, as well as larger ones across the country, and Europe. 4. £50, for small catering for cast and crew over the days' shoot. --------- Direction: Luka Vukos Producer: Carla Molina Whyte Story: Fergus Doyle Screenplay: Fergus Doyle and Luka Vukos Risks and challenges One challenge that we have faced in preparing for this production pertains to the equipment that we will be using. Our previous Facebook posts will show that a large part of the pre-production concerns itself with the look of the film, specifically the construction of storyboards for specifying how the camera will move (or not move), as well as the blocking of the actors.\n\nIn effect some of the more complex shots will require camera movement. While we considered investing in a dolly track with a proper rig, we have decided to cut down on costs but also create the same effect more efficiently and to the same extent with the use of a wheel-chair, allowing to utilise more of the budget towards location-booking and cast & crew needs.

Just message or email me prior to pledging and I'll organise it separately, as this budget is already for a set amount of reserved books* - loisgolding@outlook.com The Project: 'Entertain Us' is a social documentary exploring the landscapes of British seaside towns. The project has span over the last year, covering a mixture of piers, bowling alleys and arcades across all South, East and North Western coasts. It's aim is to exhibit the current state of the resorts, and show how time has aged these places, leaving behind what can only be described as a uniquely British experience. The Book: Self publishing is an expensive job! Especially when creating a high quality Photobook. The publication will be roughly 80 pages, in a large 33x28cm book, with plenty of room to show off the punchy lines and colours of the images. High grade semi-matte paper will also add a small but necessary texture. If you would like to buy a book now, please contact loisgolding@outlook.com and I will arrange it separately, as this budget only allows costs for reserved books. The Outcome: The publication of these books will hopefully allow time for interest to gather so I can later fund a larger run of books and sell them. I also hope to develop a reputation and 'name' which will allow me to later produce an exhibition in multiple locations. Risks and challenges The completion of this project will hopefully result in a aided push into the photographic industry, alongside a beautiful and professional photo book! Help me make it happen!

    "textDescription": "Story Photo Credit for Project Image: Will R. - Switzerland The project When I heard about the exchange program my university has set up with l'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, or EPFL, in Switzerland, I was immediately drawn to it. I am lucky enough to be studying there next semester, and it will be a great chance to take some stunning photographs. I have therefore decided to compile a photobook in order to summarize and better understand the experience. \n I am an engineer Engineers have an important role in the world, especially as the world experiences more and more globalization. Technology has an incredible impact, what with smart phones and advancements in medicine, and the green movement. Technology will never stop moving forward, so it's important that it moves in the right direction. This is why I believe it is important for me, as an engineer, to have a solid understanding of the context of my work. I think studying abroad is a perfect opportunity to better understand how engineers affect changes across the globe. \n\n\nPhoto Credit: Linnea C. - In the mosaics of the Magic Gardens, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \n \n\n \n\n\nRight now I am considering pursuing a combination of engineering and public health. I think going abroad will help me clarify the direction I would like to take when I graduate. Past experiences The past two years I have been fortunate enough to travel to Central America with my university's chapter of Global Medical Brigades. Last year, on the trip, I had one of the most incredible and rewarding experiences of my life. The other students traveling with me definitely contributed to that. Being on the brigade was a unique opportunity: we worked on a water well that would deliver clean water to an entire community at a low cost. We got to speak to the lead engineer, Marco, about the particulars of the project. Building the well helped me understand, through a very personal experience, just how important engineers are, beyond developing modern technology. \n\n\nA path in the town of San Francisco in Intibucá, Honduras \n \n\n \n\n\nWhy Switzerland Switzerland is very different from Central America. It's in Europe. It has a stronger economy than most Central American countries. I've heard people are very nice, just as they are in Central America. Going to Switzerland will be a way to mix things up a bit. It will be a different perspective to reiterate the global context of engineering. I'm very excited to practice my French. The opportunity to learn French is one of the main reasons I chose French Switzerland. I've spent a long time studying Spanish, and from that I know that the best way, and really only way, to learn a language well is to immerse yourself in the culture and get to know the people. EPFL is a renowned institute of technology and has a great exchange program with Carnegie Mellon. It is right on Lake Geneva. They have a lot of interesting research projects going on. And something like 40% of their students are international. EPFL is a great place for me to expand my understanding of the world as an engineer. Giving back Giving back is important, on a short-term scale and a long-term scale. My main motivations for going abroad are to better equip myself to give back on a long-term scale. Photographs, stories behind photographs, are great ways to share the experience and to give back. And that's my intent with this kickstarter: your financial support will help both fund and share my experience with people who care about it. The project expenses include travel and living expenses, as well as the cost to produce the final photobook which I will be compiling, and costs of other rewards. \n\n\nBoats by Lake Harriet, Minneapolis, Minnesota (my hometown) \n \n\n \n\n\nIn addition, I will be maintaining a blog while abroad and would love for you to check it out: just click here. Rewards In case you're curious, here are what a couple of the rewards I am offering look like: Sticker: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClock: \n\n\n\n\n\nPhotobook: Link to google images of photobook Risks and challenges Spending months in a foreign country, especially when you are not fluent in any of the national languages, is outside of most people's comfort zone. I am not exception. However, that is not a good enough reason for me not to go.\n\nI expect the greatest challenges will be ones I can't predict, but these challenges will contribute to making the experience as rewarding as I expect it will be. Other challenges that I expect to face include: finding a balance between school work and the rest of life, taking classes in a foreign language, and communicating with my life back in the US.

    "textDescription": "Story In summer of 2008, over drinks with a friend of mine who is also an actor, I was complaining (as usual) about my career.  His reply was simple: \"If you're bored, you should create your own work.\" Scary!  \"But I don't know how. Where do I start? What do I do?\" He said, \"Write from you. Write about what you know.\" I responded geekily, \"Well, I am an avid diary-writer...\" And he answered, \"So, just start re-reading what you've already written. Look for patterns, then write a scene.\" It was that initial conversation (as well as some other huge pointers from equally cool people) that led me to finding Matt Hoverman's writing class, aptly titled \"Create Your Own Solo Show.\" The resulting show, “Love. Guts. High School ” was developed over a twelve month period.  It's a 60-minute show about chasing one boy obsessively through high school, and its my attempt at discovering how your high school experience can affect your adult ideas of love.  High school is about figuring out who you are, how you fit into society, how you relate to other people. So is dating, in a way. Given that love has a lot to do with your sense of self I wanted to find out, How much can a messy teenage relationship alter who you are? Do you ever wonder if you got wired wrong? Well, I do.  And I wrote this solo show to find the answer. So where's this money going to?  Well, I've set my sights on two  upcoming reputable solo show festivals in New York - Midtown International Theater Festival (June 2012) and the New York International Fringe (August 2012).  I'm still waiting to hear back from both, but I also intend on taking this show beyond NYC in 2013.  $20 at a bar is a cocktail and a tip (at least in New York).  But $20 for me would mean I'm one step closer to my goal of creating my own fulfilling work.  If 125 people gave $20 I'd have my entire budget!  More than that, your vote of confidence would mean so much to me.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story and learn about my project!

    "textDescription": "Story NEW GOAL : $10,000 \nI am so happy to tell you we've surpassed our original goal for our campaign in just 11 days! I So now we have a new goal of $10,000 for our campaign. $10,000 will allow us to make an even better set and give me more creative freedom to give Neil's world a lot of subtle details that You'll love.  I can hire Ron to be an assistant animator and hire my incredible composer Daniel Cadwell for the music. if we go beyond $10,000 We can also make the short even better by paying for extended time in a professional studio, where we can really light the film well. So much of what makes stop motion unique is the lighting and it would be... Incredible if we could get a great studio.  So again, thank you so much! Have a happy holiday season and Please spread the word.  Tell everyone you know about Neil and help us make him the best he can be. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BIG IDEA Faceless Neil is a dark fairy tale for young tweens and adults about an 11 year old boy, who is cursed by a Gypsy witch, and must travel between the worlds of the living and the dead to find his lost face. The idea for Faceless Neil was sparked about 4 years ago by a simple little sketch that popped into my head one day.  This simple sketch grew into an idea that inspired, 2 short animated films (including the award winning \"The Face Shop\"), which developed characters from the Faceless Neil Universe and their creepy wonderful world of MORTEVILLE. \nAs the project progressed, professionals within the entertainment industry discovered Neil and interest to develop the story into a stop motion animation feature film script grew.  After writing a feature screenplay about the Epic journey of Neil to \nrecover his face I made lots of concept art and started \nstoryboarding.  BUT stop motion feature animated films are expensive.  To create more industry buzz and showcase my vision for the project, I want to direct a new 2 to 4 minute short film \"Faceless Neil\" that will represent what a FEATURE animated film of Faceless Neil can look like. OUR GOAL To make a short film, taken from the feature screenplay that will attract investors interested in financing the feature.  The short film will be a great way to promote the feature project by going to pitch, Festivals etc… We need at least $6,500 to make the film .  If we can get more than $6,500, then we can create an even better short with a more intricate set, costumes, and a studio to rent out for the shoot.  We also need talented voice over actors and a little team to make this short film look AMAZING!  Most of my team is currently volunteering their time and hard work because they believe in the project SO much.  But the more everyone contributes to our campaign the better the short film will be because then I can pay my team for their quality work.  I know a lot of you from the Faceless Neil website and daily comic are excited to learn more about Neil, how he lost his face, and his adventure through the afterworld to get it back.  Contribute today and we are one step closer to bringing this unique story to the big screen.  Support the short film and the feature is very likely to follow SOONER than LATER!  LETS MAKE THIS HAPPEN! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN Why $6,500? Well, most professional 5-6 minute stop \nmotion animation shorts  can cost over $75,000.  A brilliantly engineered \npuppet like the one you see in Coraline or The Fantastic Mr. Fox can cost\n as much as $6,000 EACH.  I only ask for a fraction of this to start \nthe film because I have colleagues so passionate about the project that they are volunteering their free time and energy to help bring Faceless Neil to life.   I found incredibly talented people who can make the puppets for less \nthan $3,000 a piece and build them in as fast as 3 to 4 weeks.   I can also do a lot of things myself; storyboarding, animating, \nediting… BUT I cannot do everything.  I need talented people for puppet \nengineering, set design, lighting, acting…AND some of these services will cost some money. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more money we have the better the short will look!  Anything raised above our minimum goal will go directly into the production of the short.  Better puppets, set design, studio rental, and MORE Prizes!!! The short will be about 2 to 4 minutes long which means a total production time of about 2 to 4 months.  Once the short is complete it will be sent out to producers in the entertainment industry (along with the feature film script) to create even greater interest in the film so that I can make the feature film.  I will also make exclusive motion tests and teasers to help promote the funding for the feature. Imagine THIS in stop motion; \n\nThe Team We are a small team now but with your help we will get more talented people on board! I’ll be working with the amazing puppet makers and stop motion artists;Ron Cole http://wobblytripod.blogspot.com/ Sal Denaro http://www.saldenaro.com/ And if we can afford it!Ralph Cordero (Laika Studio)https://www.facebook.com/raphael.corderostudios/photos_albums \n\nRisks and Rewards No risk to you!  Kickstarter is all or nothing.  If by the end of the campaign I have not reached or exceeded the goal, anything that you donated goes back to you.  However, when we do reach the goal you will receive individual rewards based on the amount you gave. Check them out on the right side of the page and below.  It’s a win-win situation. I have very cool prizes!!  If you like traditional animation you’re in for a treat! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter ?The great thing about Kickstarter is the opportunity it provides for me to spread the word about Faceless Neil and expand our community of fans around the world.  Faceless Neil is a very promising project, and I hope people will like what they see and will demand to see more ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS All of your contributions are immensely appreciated! Your support to independent quality film shall not be forgotten!  You will make history! Thank you so much for giving Neil a chance to make it to the big screen.  To stay updated on the campaign and the project follow us on Facebook! You can also show your support by getting a exclusive t-shirt of faceless Neil here . Risks and challenges While there is a lot of interest in making the feature there is unfortunately no guarantee that the feature will be made once the short is complete. But the short gives me a much better chance to get the feature film made and prove myself as a new director. There are also risks of running into production delays for the short film which means you might not get to see the short film by the presumed date. Stop motion is a tedious process and there are always unexpected challenges and issues that you need to face and resolve, which usually means re-shoot or delays in the production. I've made only 3 short films that used stop motion animation and I am not as experienced in that medium. I have more experience as a 2d animator, however, I know I will learn during this process and do my best to make the most of this opportunity with everyone's help.

    "textDescription": "Story Almost a year ago, I embarked upon a recording journey. I was compelled by some force within me- Make a record album.  I had some idea of how to do this; I'd co-written and recorded albums with a half dozen bands over the past two decades, but never had I made the trek alone.... I write songs. I've written songs for over 30 years. I wanted to make an album of songs that had never flown. I wanted to give these as-of-yet-unheard tunes wings and voices. Set these Starbirds free! What should I do? Make a 3 song \"demo\"? An EP? That's what my budget said to do- I had about $3000 saved for a recording project.  I knew I wanted a professional, analogue sound with the best musicians available. I booked San Francisco analogue institution Tiny Telephone and the venerable Decibelle studio to track, and Tiny to Mix. Consummate professionals Jay and Ian Pellicci would engineer. I found local powerhouses Peter Ffrench and Jason Slota to create rhythms, and marvelous bassist Van Spragins to fill the bottom end. These 3 to 5 songs would be so satisfying to hear all sparkly and clean and loud.  It's an old story. I couldn't stop. The force was too great. 12 songs and 14 days in the studio later, the bill was much higher. Bankrupty higher. And still no record to show for it. And now it's come to this. I have a wonderful family with a beautiful wife and two adorable young kids. I have wonderful friends I never see and rarely talk to. I want to do so much- I just want to Rock! There's just no time . Perhaps you can relate to this cultural conundrum. The songs are finished. They sound wonderful. Please help me pay for the completion of this album. I'm tapped out.

I've hired Bob Weston @ Chicago Mastering Services to master, Artist Phil Ristaino for visual impact, and Mixonic to produce CD's. I don't have the funds to pay them, so we're in a holding pattern. Needless to say, I'm anxious to get this baby off the ground. I would be so grateful to have you as a part of this endeavor. Thank you.

UPDATE 11/7/2013: The second stretch goal has been reached! Another limited edition print will be added! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm A.L. Swartz, a freelance artist and illustrator. My style of artwork is typified by dream-like, faintly creepy and macabre fantasy wildlife. I am a mostly self-taught artist, and I'm inspired by cartoons, video games, scientific illustration, and tattoo work. You can view more of my work at skullgarden.net . While I am naturally a mixed media artist by trade, I also like to dabble in other mediums as well. One of my other artistic interests is linoleum block printing. I first took it up as a way to challenge myself by using a reductive process to art making rather than an additive one. I found myself drawn to the process and realized that carving linoleum was incredibly fun and relaxing. You can read more about the process of linoleum block printing, or \"linocuts\", here . This Kickstarter project is to fund the creation of a small line of linocut prints based around animal skulls, plants, mushrooms, and stones in a similar style to my personal paintings. These prints are going to be thematically similar to my personal work with the chunky linework and energy that can only be found in block printing. \n\n\n\n\n\nEach carving will start out as an 9x12\" drawing. Then I will transfer the drawing (mirrored, of course!) to the linoleum, where I will then carve out the negative space leaving only the areas that are to be printed.  Each print will be hand printed by me in my studio. I will use water soluble and acid free inks on 100% recycled French paper. Each print will be 12x16\" and will be signed and dated in silver pen. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow Kickstarter works Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform for potential projects.

Here are some tips to help you receive your rewards in a smooth, timely manner. - The email you have listed on Kickstarter MUST be a valid email that you check frequently. The longer it takes you to respond to your survey once funding has ended, the longer it takes for you to receive your reward. Please respond as quickly as possible. - I will copy and paste your address exactly as you write it in your survey, so your address must be correctly spelled and laid out. If your rewards are returned to me due to a bad address, I will contact you and you must repay for shipping.  - I cannot ship to international P.O. Boxes. Please provide a physical address or ask a friend or relative if they will allow you to have your rewards shipped to their home. - Please make sure that your credit card information is up to date on Amazon.com.  If it is not up to date, then your pledge will be declined once funding has ended and you will be dropped as a backer. (Though if this happens accidentally, you can contact me and I can provide alternate payment options) \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges There are always risks when printing a large amount of prints like this. There is the possibility that not all of the prints will turn out, which means I will have to throw them out and make more. While incredibly frustrating for me, it shouldn't set the project back too far.\n\nThere is also the possibility of me injuring myself with the carving knives; however, if I did accidentally cut myself with one, it would most likely be my left hand instead of my dominant hand which would mean no real set backs other than pain. Fortunately, I have been very careful and have managed not to stab myself (yes, I did just knock on wood).\n\nThis is a fairly small and manageable project, and I have experience running Kickstarter campaigns and meeting deadlines. I feel confident that I can complete this project by the deadline with no issues. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Or you have seen a lot but not that excited to watch anymore? I understand. It is risky for both audience and artists to share a dance; a personal journey. But we do not give up. In the residency at Mana Fine Arts, NJ, we are trying to seek what is real to our humanity, and reveal it to reach you. And what is the excitement of our dance, what is our strength and weakness? Maybe you go to museums to have fun or deepen your thought. Maybe you have seen a lot of beautiful moments in your daily life. Our dance is not difficult to enjoy. We are on the same page! What we make? We are running a residency project at Mana Fine Arts, NJ Oct 28- Dec 20, 2013 to create a new work, GHOST SHOE , and rework on 1000 DESIGNS . 7 dancers- Jake Bone, Alessandra Delle Grotti, Sarah Lifson, Monica Mordaunt, ,Lynda Senisi, Ellyn Sjoquist, Nattie Trogdon- are involved and working so hard Monday through Friday everyday.  GHOST SHOE is very unique piece, in which dancers use long shoe laces attached to their shoes. 1000 DESIGNS was developed by MATH TIME (2012) , and purely focused on dancing, without too much thinking of strategy, but still based on the deep thoughts and research. We want to show you! As the output, we are presenting these works at CRUSHED MUFFINS , artists gathering on Dec 7, 2013 at The Works Studio as well as the casual showcases at Mana. Dec 17-12:30pm & Dec 18-1pm . We are very excited to share the work with you! \nThank you so much for your support! \n http://kensaku.jimdo.com Risks and challenges The hardest thing is to have audience and supporters after we make the piece.\nThere are numerous dance projects in NYC and it is hard to tell which is which. And because of the nature of the art, it is not always directly benefit the audience. Some are more subtle, in telling their story.\nEven in such situation, we have to keep trying to reach people. We have to speak up. We have to keep telling people what we are making. Because we are very serious and determined to give a statement to the world by creating dance.

Quick pledge shipping update: Just to clear up any questions about international shipping. Say, for instance, you want to pledge at the Fireteam level. The pledge is $17. If you are not in the US you add $6 to that for shipping for a total of $23.00.   The total cost for each pledge level for international shipping is: \nSquad: $17 \nFireteam: $23\n  \nPlatoon: $39 \nCompany: $67\n  \nBattalion: $131 \n Thanks and please let us know if you have any more questions! -- \nWe here at ClearHorizon Miniatures started in May of 2013 with the release of our Drop Pod kit and then shortly after, our first range, the Hell Divers.  \nSince then we have grown to include two different factions with almost 15 different miniature packs and vehicle kits.  \nWe’re very active in the online and offline communities. We most recently had a booth at the Gamex Stratigecon convention in Los Angeles and we sell our line through our website as well as retail channels with Brookhurst hobbies carrying our entire line at their store in Garden Grove, California. \n\nWe have two new ranges that we need your help in getting into production! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Ranges \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpsilon Squad \n \n\n \n\n\nEpsilon Squads  are a Human combat force outfitted with hard-hitting weaponry and Exo-skeleton armored suits. Epsilon Squads fight on the front line, whether establishing an Orbital Beachhead or taking a city back from enemy forces. \nThe individual Epsilon Squad trooper is a force to be reckoned with and whole platoons can be transported via Raven-Class VTOLs to strike at the heart of the enemy force.\n \n\nEpsilon Squads operate in teams of six that can then be further broken down into fireteams of three or two (depending on the tactical situation).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hura Technocracy represents an alien species known as the Hura. While possessing traits of both crabs and mantis insects, the Hura are an advanced species that use their technology to give them every advantage. Not only do they have a strong chitin outer skeleton that can deflect blows almost as well as most basic Human body armor, they utilize a powerful series of miniature, close-contact forcefield generators that provide an extra layer of defense without limiting their strength and speed.\n\nTheir weaponry, nicknamed \"Lightning Rods', strike out with powerful beams that can fry not only organic material but any unshielded electronics as well.\n \nThe Hura will often trade technology (often of a lower quality than their own equipment) for the service of Mercenaries in their border conflicts and have found an occasional \"ally\" in humanity. But only as long as it serves their needs. \n\nThe Hura themselves prefer to let “lower” species do most of the fighting when they can, but can be a formidable fighting force themselves. They can also be exceedingly pragmatic leading to the impression that they are very callous. Despite this they are avid explorers that have even been known to use human epsilon teams as hired muscle for long term exploration missions.\n \nThe Hura will strive to maintain a strict 8-Hura fireteam at all times, although they have been known to split into two 4-strong fireteams under times of extreme duress. \n\nPledges and Rewards \n\n\nNote: All Pledges include US Shipping Costs and all International Pledges will have the appropriate costs per pledge added on. Please see pledge for more info. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Should You Back This Kickstarter? \n\nYou should back if you love 15mm Sci-Fi miniatures as much as we do and want to see new and unique sets! \nThis is also a great opportunity for someone new to the 15mm Sci-Fi scene.  A Platoon pledge will get you two small starter armies for 15mm Sci-Fi Gaming and we'll even be offering Gruntz Unit Data cards for download to help build up your armies! \nYou'll also get them before anyone else (We guarantee that! No retail sales until every KS backer has received their pledge!) and at a discount off of retail prices. (We haven't set the retail prices yet, but it will most likely be around the $8 mark) \nIf you have any questions please ask! \nStretch Goals \n\n\nOnce we pass our funding goals we have several plans in place to expand on the basic squads, including heavy support and more figure poses.  Everyone with Fireteam level or higher pledges will be able to either a) add-on the new options or b) trade out a squad for them. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n As we get closer to the funding goal we will reveal the options! \nWhy Should you Trust Us? \nWe have a long history in the 15mm Sci-Fi community and are an active participant in it. We also have a history of producing quality miniatures.   Our miniatures have been reviewed by the print publication \"Miniature Wargames with Battlegames\"  as well as across the web. Our Hell Diver and Mercenary ranges have been very successful and have been well received. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are people saying about our Kickstarter? \n\"ClearHorizon miniatures' realization of this terrific line of miniatures has really captured our attention with their latest releases. The concept is solid and the execution in design has been brilliant. We are all looking forward immensely to what is yet to come and hope that the Kickstarter campaign delivers everything required for Harold and his team to punch through with an industry shaking product. We will be watching this develop with eager anticipation...\n \" \n-Anton \n  \n\nFlytrap Factory \n \n\n\n Risks and challenges We are confident that we will able to fulfill this Kickstarter on time. We've already started the sculpting and now we just need to be able to fund the additional sculpting and production costs\n\nWe have a talented sculptor with years of experience at some of the biggest miniature companies around and we utilize a contract caster that has the highest level of quality control and many, many years of experience with mold making and casting. \n\nWe also have backup plans in case things go sideways and are well prepared for any unforeseen complications.

Any further support will be put to very good use! Esperanza: A Gang Intervention A Photo Documentary by Darren Ornitz\n “If I were to say that violence wasn’t a part of my life, I’d be lying…One of the biggest problems faced by a human being is the fear of change, to get out of the comfort zone and security and do things differently from the way they have always been done. We need more courage.  I would like to wake up every day with a purpose, to be a positive example for those who have no hope.” This project is a long term photo documentary about a gang in the neighborhood of Casco Viejo, Panama. The project focuses around life in this rapidly gentrifying community as well as the community members' involvement in a gang intervention and reintegration program run by Esperanza, a local social enterprise. It illuminates the intimate realities behind this layered and complex community effort. This is a story about transition and human connection. It explores Casco's history with violence & incarceration, the overhang of police repression, and how Esperanza's community solution is tackling the complex problems facing at-risk youth and vulnerable populations. More deeply, however, this is a story about the suffering, joy, struggle, and love that come with change - a story that reflects us all in one way or another. In that way, I have found this story to be about the deep truth that despite the very real circumstances that differentiate us, we are all united and connected by our shared humanity. My goal by telling this story is to highlight what we can accomplish when we loosen our prejudices and preconceived ideas about one another and instead do our best to understand and relate. If more than the target goal is raised in this Kickstarter, my dream for this project is to make it into a book.   Gracias a toda mi familia en panama por ayudarme a hacer esto posible. Este proyecto es dedicado a ustedes Thanks to everyone who has made this project possible so far, to my friends and family in Casco Viejo,Panama, the U.S. and throughout the world.  Special thanks to Sarah Tyler for the drone footage!    \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Given the sensitive nature of this documentary the time frame for this project is very fluid. My goal is to go back four times, every six months for the next two years, however this is subject to change depending on circumstances on the ground there. Nonetheless, I am extremely committed to this story and I want to see it through. I plan to document it as long as I have the resources to do so and am making every effort to make sure that is the case. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

All we need is 300+ people to pledge at least thirty dollars. You will essentially be pre-ordering a DVD of the film (with your name in the thank you credits) and at the same time help us immensely in our quest to turn our little movie into a blockbuster! \nShot in New York in the summer of 2009, \"Violet Tendencies\" stars Mindy Cohn (best known for playing Natalie on “The Facts of Life”), as a straight woman trying to distance herself from her gay friends to find romantic love on her own. \nWe've had great success with the film on the festival circuit since its May 2010 premiere. It has picked up multiple Best Comedy awards and also a Best Actress Award for Mindy. In addition to the 50+ festivals it played, we also opened the film theatrically in two cities so far; New York and Los Angeles. \nSo why do we need YOUR help? Simply put, we want to self-distribute the DVD and releasing a film on DVD is expensive. Of course we want our DVD to have the highest possible quality and come filled with extras, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, filmmaker commentary, and subtitles. In addition to the authoring and manufacturing costs, we also would like to mount a national PR campaign for the DVD-release (scheduled for May of 2011) so that more people not only hear about the film, but hopefully also pick up a copy. \n“Violet Tendencies” is the labor of love of two individuals: Director/producer/actor Casper Andreas and writer/producer/actor Jesse Archer. But we couldn’t have done it without our amazing cast and crew who like ourselves poured a lot of hard work, energy and all their talent into the film, and we hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed making it. Additional information about the film can be found at www.violettendenciesmovie.com \nCheck out all the great rewards we are offering for helping us fund our release (signed DVDs, your name in the thank you credits, a special edition DVD to arrive in time for the holidays, and even associate producer credit!).

    "textDescription": "Story Production Begins Time Now!   Due to such high demand, we are only offering the 400-card deck and wounded Vet decks. In doing so, Disgruntled Decks ensures that rewards will be delivered in a timely manner, and that the business can grow at a responsible and realistic rate. Our Disgruntled backers deserve the best!   Now What?   Backer surveys will be sent out in the coming weeks in order to collect information needed to deliver rewards (e.g., addresses, custom messages for ammo cans, custom card requests, etc.).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisgruntled Decks: The Original Card Game For Veterans. Disgruntled Decks is a card game for military service members and grizzled Veterans who enjoy getting together and laughing about their time in the service.  I've titled this first deck \"The Army Edition\" because it features some topics that would be familiar to U.S. Army Soldiers and Veterans. However, there are more than enough general military cards to make the game enjoyable for service members and Veterans from any branch of the armed forces. Disgruntled Decks can be played by itself or integrated with a Cards Against Humanity® deck. I am aiming for a delivery date before July 4th because everyone should be able to play while celebrating America! \n\n\nYour poor mother! \n \n\n \n\n\nBringing Veterans Together It's no secret that service members and Veterans like to get together, have a few (well, maybe more than a few) drinks, and swap stories about deployment and the nonsense which accompanies military life. \n\n With a unique blend of descriptive language and military themes, Disgruntled Decks gives one more reason for service members and Veterans to come together and talk about their shared experiences while having fun in the process. I strongly believe that humor is healing, and some Veterans still have a good amount of healing left to do. I hope to provide some of that humor with Disgruntled Decks. \n\n\nCondom + PT belt = All the sex! \n \n\n \n\n\nPlaying the Game: So Easy the Infantry Can Do It! The \"Card Commander\" will read aloud an OD green Mission Card and \"Subordinate\" players will submit their gray Course of Action (COA) cards with possible answers. The Card Commander chooses the best COA regardless of the Subordinates' opinions, just like in the military! You win by having the most COAs chosen. It's that simple! \n\n\nNothing beats two LTs slap fighting over some missing property. \n \n\n \n\n\n The Deck The deck is composed of 90 OD green Mission Cards and 310 gray Course of Action cards. For those with poor ASVAB scores, that equals 400 cards! Here are a few fun facts about the card design: - The font is a typewriter font found on portable typewriters used during WWII . In other words, your grandpa killed Nazis and then typed out his AAR or a love letter in this font.  - The \"invasion star \" found on the backs of the cards came into common usage towards the end of 1943 and was used by all Allied forces from the time of Normandy on.  - The OD green color is identical to the color used to paint U.S. Army and other military vehicles during the early years of WWII .  - The light gray color can be found in the U.S. Army branding toolkit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why $15,000? Ordering 500 Disgruntled Decks (the minimum order from our supplier) with custom boxes is expensive, and so is shipping them. After taking into account the various costs associated with all reward tiers, along with the 5% Kickstarter fee and 3-5% credit card processing fee, the realistic cost of delivering a quality product is just above the $14,000 mark. Murphy's Law states whatever can happen will, so the extra buffer will be set aside to cover any unexpected costs that may arise. Any profit generated from this campaign will be put back into Disgruntled Decks LLC and used to: 1) support development of the upcoming editions; 2) order additional decks to satisfy increased demand, and; 3) offset costs associated with legal support. \n\n\nArmy Strong! \n \n\n \n\n\n\"Disgruntled Decks™\" is a trademark of Disgruntled Decks LLC. It is not affiliated with \"Cards Against Humanity®\" (a trademark of Cards Against Humanity LLC), the Department of Defense, or any government agency or branch of the military. We do not in any conceivable way represent the official views of the aforementioned entities. The content of this game is 100% satire. Risks and challenges I've been working for months with numerous members of the military community to generate card ideas and, quite simply, to just make a bad-ass game that service members and Veterans will enjoy. A lot of the leg work has already been done, and now it comes down to running a successful Kickstarter and delivering a great product.\n\nYou can count on me being as transparent as possible and submitting progress updates to keep everyone informed.

My book is about a superhero called Elemental, who can turn into the periodic table of elements, for example he can turn into titanium for super strength, radon to become a radioactive gas, mercury to be a liquid metal, Potassium for purple fire power, or tungsten for heat resistant’s and so on.  The money from my Kickstarter will be used to print and distribute the comic book Elemental issue 1 to local schools and book shops. This comic book is designed to thrill the imaginative mind and at the same time is educational. When Elemental turns into an element a bar next to him is shown with the elements names. Its symbol, its number in the periodic table and the facts about the element. And it has a Quiz in the back so you can test yourself on what you have learned. by James Purdy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI first came up with the idea for Elemental when I worked in a school where I tutored two kids in science, I had two children who were gifted but unchallenged in science. So I created Elemental so that they could learn the basics of chemistry and enjoy learning at the same time. They loved Elemental, and were able to apply what they learned to their school work. THE STORY IN A NUTSHELL \n\n\nLazy boy Sean Reily \n \n\n \n\n\n Sean Reily is the main character of this book, his parents died when he was very young and so he lives with his uncle John. Sean is a lazy selfish boy, not relay a bad kid just a typical twelve year old lad. Sean goes of to a boarding school called The Hill Community school, where his uncle teaches science.  \n\n\nSasha gets bulled \n \n\n \n\n\n However he hates it there because all the staff are evil (except his uncle John) and the head teacher miss Jane Hill is secretly a crime boss. One day Sean bumps into a child crying on the stairs, the child was being bullied and Sean ignored him, because he thought this kid is someone else's problem. \n\n\nSean discovers his grave mistake. \n \n\n \n\n\nA few days later Sean saw on a notice board that the child committed suicide, Sean was devastated he didn't even know his name, all Sean had to do was talk to him to let him know he's not alone, but he couldn't be bothered. He becomes a good person after his life lesson. Sean vowed never to let anyone suffer, and to never look the other way again when his help was needed. \n\n\nWares his suit for the first time \n \n\n \n\n\nThe first book is focussing on how Sean got his powers when his uncle's experiment blew up, and him meeting his friends and other characters in the comic book. Don't worry there is still lots of action in his life, and also deadly enemies who want to rule England and only Elemental stands in their way. \n\n\nEnter Drake \n \n\n \n\n\nSean's biggest enemy is Drake A man in a pyrotechnic armour who for some mysterious reason wants to kill Elemental. I like this character because there is a great twist at the end of Elemental issue 1 where we find out why he wants Elemental dead so badly. \n\n\nElemental kicks butt \n \n\n \n\n\n REWARDS FOR PLEDGES  Background pack \n\n\nThe background pack gives you 3 jpeg images that can be used as desktop wallpaper on a computer, mac or I-pad, this is image 1. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBackground pack image 2 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBackground pack image 3 \n \n\n \n\n\nPledge £3 or more\n BACKGROUND PACK 3 image's from the comic, for desktop, I- phone and I-pad wallpaper.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\"FlowPaw opens young minds to become digitally literate and be the designers of the future - Make your own Internet Of Things\" \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is FlowPaw? FlowPaw is an electronics board that plugs into a PC via USB. It has all the things you need to build your own gadgets and gizmos: buttons, LEDs, sensors and electronic inputs. You can also plug remote controlled (RC) servo motors directly onto the board to create robots or other mechanical devices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowPaw is expandable using extensions called Click Boards. There are 4 claws on the Paw and each can take a different click board.Currently we support 10 Click boards and we will be adding 10 more by the end of the campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I program it? \n We’ve partnered FlowPaw with FlowStone STEM a new version of our award winning graphical programming software, FlowStone. It’s super intuitive; by simply connecting building blocks together you literally draw out a program. Best of all, everything works in real time so you can modify your creation as it’s running!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith FlowStone you can create easy to manage, modular programs as quickly as you can think them up. By mixing graphical and text based programming children can learn how to code at their own pace without being dropped in at the deep end.  \n\nWhy are we doing this? When we were kids computers were just starting to appear in the home. We remember the excitement of having this almost magical box that you could do anything you wanted with.  Today computers and electronic gizmos are everywhere. Kids use them all the time but almost always as consumers. Instead of making their own creations, they just use ones that are already there. We want to open up the same world of possibilities that we had when we were younger by giving kids the chance to make computers do what they want. With your help we can inspire the next generation of coders, programmers and gizmo makers! What can I Make? Almost anything!  How about a burglar alarm to detect whether your sister or brother is sneaking into your bedroom?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a music synthesiser that you control with your hand…  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to play your favourite Spotify tunes from the comfort of the sofa? No problem…  \n\n\n(SpeakUp click board not included in standard kit) \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\nPerhaps a games controller ? (With FlowStone you can even make the game too!)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr how about your own remote controlled robot ? How cool would that be?!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these are just a few ideas. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination….  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s inside the box? We’ve designed a beautiful package to deliver FlowPaw to you that's small enough to fit through a standard letterbox. Inside you’ll find the FlowPaw board itself, a neat retractable USB cable, four awesome click boards comprising an 8x8 LED display, accelerometer (think Wii), proximity sensor and a buzzer (mono synthesizer).    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also a handy quick start guide and a CD for installing the FlowStone STEM software, which comes with a host of examples to get you started. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho’s it for? Initially we had school children and students in mind but really anyone with dreams of creating their own gizmos or who wants to learn programming can use it.  What do I need to use it? FlowPaw will work with any computer with a USB port. Our graphical programming software, FlowStone STEM is designed for Windows® PCs. However, you can run this on a Mac if you have Parallels Desktop/Bootcamp or some other virtual machine software running Windows®. You can also program the board from a Raspberry Pi using Python. This can be done wirelessly too! Why we need your help We want to get FlowPaw into as many people’s hands (paws) as possible. To do that it needs to be affordable.  To get the best price possible we need to place a large order with our manufacturers. We’re almost there. We've sent a bunch of FlowPaws out to schools, colleges, students, friends and family. The feedback has been great - they love it! So we're all ready to push the 'go' button and really need your help to make this a reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does FlowPaw help children learn coding? Having something physical to program is so much more interesting than just seeing something happening on a screen. With just a few components a child can easily wire up a button to play a sound or turn an LED on. It’s simple stuff but it’s incredibly rewarding. We’ve watched children’s reactions to this and they just love it. By making programming fun a child is instantly engaged in what they are doing and they’ll push on to learn more. Our FlowStone software is incredibly visual and immediate in its nature. You don’t need to learn about source files or compilers before you can get started. Just drag a few components to your schematic and you’re up and running. What’s more, everything you do runs in real time. No building and testing - it all happens instantly.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there are no barriers in the way, children can concentrate more on their project and less on wrestling with the technology. Finally, the software is modular. Functionality can be hidden away in modules that children can start to learn about when they are ready - they don’t need to deal with this up front.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they are ready to try some text based coding they can do it in little snippets using our amazing Ruby component. This integrates seamlessly with the rest of the graphical programming in FlowStone so projects can have any proportion of code from zero to completely coded. Can I use my Pi? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a Raspberry Pi you can code in Python or use Scratch if that's your thing. You can even code in FlowStone on the PC and send data to your Raspberry Pi & FlowPaw via WiFi. \n\n\nPython code controlling FlowPaw \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nScratch Code controlling FlowPaw \n \n\n \n\n\nThe FlowPaw will connect to just about anything with a USB port :) Who are you guys?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDSP Robotics (OutSim Ltd.) is a small UK based software company and now a hardware start-up.  We started creating graphical programming software back in 2002 for fun. The idea was to create a general visual programming environment for the creation of music.  We then saw an opportunity in the maker market with electronics and robotics, so we set about adding components  that allowed the software to easily connect to external devices and FlowStone was born. For the past year and a half we’ve been talking with educators and groups like the National STEM Centre and Project Lead The Way about how FlowStone could help in education to get kids engaged with computers and electronics like we were at their age. We started by developing a STEM version of FlowStone specifically for education, and soon realized that we needed some hardware to give it teeth - (\"Software is eating the world, and hardware gives it teeth!\") This is how FlowPaw has emerged - a unique combination of hardware and software that works seamlessly.   \nFlowPaw - how it all began\n FlowPaw started out as a single claw board: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen 1 became 3 and we had phFingers: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the Hand (H&): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the Bear Paw: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the first prototype, called FlowPaw: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had 25 of these Rev 1.00 boards made and sent them out with a selection of Claws to educators and key people worldwide. Following the feedback we made a couple of small changes and the final Rev 1.01 boards were made. \n\n\nThe Finished production FlowPaw Board \n \n\n \n\n\nFor our design we chose an STM32F407 chip, previously we have been using a PIC32 chip and switching to STM was definitely a good move. The STM32 F4 is not only very powerful but a joy to program and very versatile. \n\n\n\"FlowPaw is powered by STM32 F4\" \n \n\n \n\n\n How real is this, does it work? We’ve been developing the FlowPaw board and integrating it with FlowStone STEM for the last 9 months. The hardware has been tested extensively both in house, by ourselves, and externally by a select group of educators. We are now have the new 2nd  generation (Rev 1.01) boards tested and working perfectly and are ready to move into full production. For manufacturing we have partnered with MikroElektronika , an ISO9001 listed company with a wealth of experience in electronics manufacture. The Click Boards have been sold by MikroElektronika for many years now so they are already a tried and tested product. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese guys are brilliant. You can literally give them a paper napkin with your idea sketched on it and they'll send you back a market-ready finished and packaged product in a matter of months. They have state of the art production facilities and their attention to detail is second to none.  \n\nIf you're curious to learn what sort of equipment FlowPaw is made on, you can see it on MikroElektronika's contract manufacturing page at http://www.mikroe.com/contract-manufacturing   We hope that this will convince you that we can deliver what we're promising and produce a rock solid, tightly integrated platform that works beautifully. Where can I find out more? Please check out our blog at www.flowpaw.com where you can read about our journey from concept to where we are now.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on our FlowStone software at www.dsprobotics.com   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even download a trial a copy of FlowStone.

Today, Pixel Press recreates the run and jump gaming experience, but in a completely new way. Don't just play a video game - create your own! Pixel Press is making video game creation accessible to everyone, with no coding required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's not just about creating - it's also about experiencing what others have created. If you're not in the mood to create, or just don't have the time, you can play levels designed by your friends or other members of the Pixel Press community.  As new designs are continuously uploaded by users, there will always be a new level to play and a new way to compete. With Pixel Press, it's not just about creating levels, it's about great interactive experiences, created by a community of people of all ages. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel Press can be used as a family project, in classrooms , by creative artists , or as a hobby for an avid gamer . But, let’s get more specific. Were you a fan of Super Mario Brothers and Metroid in the '80’s? Have you ever imagined what it would be like to create your own video game? Maybe you even used to draw video games like us? Are you generally an awesome person? Then yeah, you’ll love Pixel Press.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work? With the Pixel Press video game level creator you are designing five floors of a video game level (Think Mario level 1-1, level 1-2, etc). Your hero will start at the bottom floor and attempt to overcome the obstacles you create to reach the elevator at the end of each floor to advance up to the next floor. Your objective is to create a level that is progressively more challenging from bottom to top.  \n\n\n\nClick here to see this up close. \n \n\n \n\n Creating a level is a simple four step process - draw, upload & test, design, play & share.   \n\n\n\n\n\nPixel Press uses a specially designed graph paper that you can print at home by downloading our FREE Sketch Kit (Printable PDF)  - any white paper works. Follow the instructions in the Sketch Kit to create the general terrain. Then, integrate hazard pits & monkey bars, moving platforms, spikes & barriers, as well as portals & powerups using the simple to use shorthand system. Here is a sample drawing.  A level drawing can be done in less than an hour, and faster once you get the hang of it. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinished drawing your level? Use Pixel Press on your iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPad mini, or iPod Touch) to snap a photo of your drawing. Pixel Press digitizes your drawing into a (wait for it....) playable video game! It’s MAGIC! Now its time to figure out if you can beat the level you just created, by testing it. See if you made a mistake by playing through your level - if there is a error you can fix it right in the app. Is your level ready? Move on to the design phase. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it's time to make your level real by adding a design skin and music from our library, you can pick from different textures, colors, characters, music, sound effects, and more.  Want to give your level a completely custom look and feel? Create your own skin and upload it to Pixel Press to make your video game truly unique. Watch the \"drawing tutorial\" video below to learn more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where Pixel Press gets social. Share your level with friends, family, classmates and co-workers to compete for the best times. In the mood to play instead of create? Search Pixel Press for levels created by others in the community and compete for Pixel Press street cred, or follow your favorite designers to get notifications when new levels are available. The gameplay and social community Pixel Press fosters is as important as its ability to create levels, because if it's not fun, who cares? So, is creating your own level really as cool as we make it sound? You bet. Let us show you: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel Press is the creation of Robin Rath , founder of Roundthird , a software creation company based in St. Louis. Robin grew up in the '80's and was an avid fan of platformer video games, and as a \nchild he used to beat video games and then draw the ‘next’ level. This activity is what led to the idea of Pixel Press, and with inspiration from friends and family, started an effort to bring it to market beginning January 2013. Robin released Radial 50  in 2009, a game for the iPhone and has led many other software & hardware development projects since. Over these last 3 months – while creating the Pixel Press brand strategy, creative materials and gathering feedback –  Robin has assembled a team of trusted developers and designers (and kids of all ages to test it!) who are working on the early stage prototype and ready to bring the Pixel Press platform to life.  Follow along with us on Twitter , Facebook , our blog and on our website, pixelpressgame.com . Why are we creating Pixel Press? \n We have been dreaming of creating our own video games since we were kids - drawing levels, imaging our characters navigating the obstacles, and sharing our ideas with friends. When we realized modern (and accessible) technology could turn game creation into something that even kids could do, we knew we had to make it happen. Pixel Press is exciting because users do not have to know how to write code, meaning everyday gamers can now become game level designers - and may eventually be inspired to take their skills to the next level and create entire games on their own. Checkout this video (also below) for more footage of my friend Josh, brother Christian, and I playing games growing up, and some bonus \"Michael Jackson\" footage! \nWe're a bit torn. Are we building this for kids or for ourselves (the adults)? There's no clear answer, and there doesn't need to be, everybody enjoys great video games, no matter how trivial - because we can play them and enjoy them together. Why are we raising money on Kickstarter? \nOver the last 3 months we've been focused heavily on testing Pixel Press conceptually with family, friends, kids and others in our industry. Based on that positive feedback, during this last month our development team has ramped up work on a prototype to lay the groundwork for the technology behind Pixel Press. \n\n\nRegister to for the prototype queue by clicking here. \n \n\n \n\n We've begun by building a PAX-MAN (like PAC-MAN, no enemies, maybe cherries ) game to keep things simple to start. Quickly we've learned that while it's absolutely possible to pull off the Pixel Press vision, we'll need to invest in creating our own optical character recognition (OCR ) software to make the level upload feature work well. We're setting a goal of $100k to help keep part of our development team focused on this key feature and to free up some of our budget to focus the rest of our team on world-class platformer gameplay and top-notch pixel artwork. Raising money here on Kickstarter, rather than taking on outside investors or partnering with a game shop, will give us the flexibility we need to build Pixel Press as we see fit - fan first. \nSo that's the story - and if we're so lucky to go beyond our $100k goal, we'll use those funds to build out more great features. See below for more information on our stretch goals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel Press is excited to offer the following rewards to our backers. For the full list and pricing see the column on the right. Also the chart below gives you a breakdown of all rewards per package. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel Press Game Download A  digital download of the Pixel Press game  for your iOS or Android device.

Available with the $2,000 reward package. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch Party & our Big Giveaways ($5,000 and $10,000 levels) With these packages (and the $2,000 package) we’ll roll out the proverbial red carpet for you to join us at our launch party in St. Louis. You're a huge reason we've reached our Kickstarter goal and been able to build Pixel Press, and we want you to celebrate with you. You will also be recognized as a key contributor in the game credits. Our launch party will be at The Silver Ballroom , St. Louis' own pinball bar, where you'll enjoy a night of free music, food, drinks, and unlimited pinball action. Space is limited (88 people), so if you want in, this is your ticket! 21 and up only. Transportation not included. Package includes ticket for you and a guest. Location subject to change. For our $5,000 backers, we want you to be a part of helping us drive the future development of the Pixel Press platform by becoming an Ambassador. We'll look forward to consulting with you on how to continue to drive both the education and \"fun-factor\" elements of Pixel Press into the future.  Also see the $10,000 limit 1 Konami Code package. Don't know what the Konami code is? See here . \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we’re able to exceed our $100k funding goal, here are the milestones related to the awesome additional things we’ll build to make Pixel Press even better.  Want to help us reach these goals? Please share and encourage your friends to contribute! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first goal, if we hit $100k we’ll make Pixel Press available on iOS devices (phones and tablets) by December 2013 and on Android Devices (phones and tablets) by June of 2014. See the FAQ for details on supported devices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we’re able to reach the $125k point we’ll also make Pixel Press available on Android in December 2013, instead of June 2014. See the FAQ for details on supported devices.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the $150k point we’ll add in Support for Ouya , include the ability for you to upload your own graphics, music and sound effects so you can make your own 100% unique levels, and we’ll also add in the ability for you to alter the physics of your character. With this feature you’ll be able to control things like how fast the player moves, how far they jump, and more – with a slider! Also we’ll add in a wall-cling physic (think Ninja Gaiden) which means you will need to design your levels differently. Sweet. \n\nWe’re considering other controller options like iCade - if we do this leaderboards will likely be separated by input style (screen vs. controller) to keep things fair. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the $175k point we’ll add “Big Squares” Mode, an alternate mode that will utilize a specially designed sketch sheet for younger kids - with 9 times bigger squares! This means the sketch sheet will be have less squares, giving designers more room to work within the space and ultimately making it easier to create levels. These levels will be more simple than their big brother levels, but will help kids get familiar with building levels in Pixel Press. We want to release Big-Square Mode as soon as possible because we know how important it is for our younger gamers. This will be a part of Pixel Press’ future, but because of the additional development, we’re not sure when. Contributing now and helping us reach this stretch goal will guarantee that Big-Square Mode will happen by the end of 2013! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we’re fortunate enough to start approaching this fund raising level, will start to talk with our backers about what things they would like to see us add .\n\nOne our top supports, Griffin is already working on a shared Google Doc right now that will capture all of the ideas from comments, emails, and messages from the web. We’ll be sharing that with you as we approach this goal, and then work on prioritizing these additions and adding them to new milestones if we hit this point. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn behalf of the entire Pixel Press team, thank you for taking the time to check us out. Your well wishes, contributions, and posts to Facebook and Twitter are what make us love what we do and will help us make Pixel Press a reality. Thank you! \n\n\nRobin Rath \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges Our most unique challenges deal with building the optical character recognition (OCR) system described above. There is a potential for lengthy quality assurance testing and related adjustments that must be made that could cause timeline delays, however our efforts to this point have left us feeling positive about the road ahead.\n\nWe’re estimating release of Pixel Press in approximately 6 months from the end of our Kickstarter (December 2013). At this point in our progress, we are confident in the estimated delivery timeline.\n\n===\n\nIf you have any questions - please feel free to email me at robin@pixelpressgame.com - will get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nOur website is pixelpressgame.com Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Dear Accounting and Audit firms: \nYou are probably facing problems of hiring and working with Millennial Generation employees. Why should there be any problems?

    "textDescription": "Story After the presidential election, students at the Urban Assembly Unison School reflected in both writing and art.  Their work inspired teachers and artists to come together to create more art in response, in the hope of sharing student voices with a wider audience.  We created a calendar out of these reflections to remind others to maintain the spirit of hope in love and resistance to hate in all forms.   We are trying to raise the funds to print this calendar in order to get our students' voices more widely shared, both to have them be heard and because of the power of their message.  We hope to raise more than the cost of printing, and to use the funds to support student engagement at the school. Unison serves a population in which more than 90 percent of students live in families whose aggregate income falls below the poverty line, more than 30 percent of whom receive special education services, more than a quarter of whom are English language learners, more than fifteen percent of whom live in temporary housing and more than 15 percent of whom live in foster care.   Supporting this project will provide Unison students with: * a full school uniform for students living in temporary housing - $25; * the opportunity for one student to attend a full day visit to a university campus - $50 per student; * to opportunity for one student to attend the 8th grade prom - $75 per student; * to opportunity for one student to attend a full day visit to Washington DC for a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture as well as other national cultural institutions - $150 per student. \n\n\nOutside Front Cover \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nJanuary \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nFebruary \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMarch \n \n\n \n \n\n\nApril \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMay \n \n\n \n \n\n\nJune \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nJuly \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nAugust \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nSeptember \n \n\n \n \n\n\nOctober \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNovember \n \n\n \n \n\n\nDecember \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nBack Cover \n \n\n \n\n  Risks and challenges A project like this takes a lot of logistics and collaboration to create a cohesive product.

    "descriptionMediaNumber": 15,
    "textLength": 9717,
    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nION showing the Plasma Mood \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy ION's genesis began with our first Kickstarter project, Ember & Torch (Bluetooth Low Energy development boards) back in June of 2013. One of the demonstrations for Ember that we built was an app-controlled LED lamp. We demonstrated Ember, Torch, and the LED lamp at Social Media Day Detroit 2013. We quickly discovered that visitors were more interested in where they could purchase the lamp than Ember & Torch. Due to this overwhelming positive response to the lamp, we knew it was time to take it to the next level and create a consumer product. ION was born. When setting out to build ION, we wanted to create something fun and beautiful. We love light and music, so we knew our device had to incorporate both. We've been working to push the boundaries of what can be done with LED lighting, and we're very excited to showcase our creation. Throughout the last nine months, we've developed 3 different designs of ION, and each time we've raised the bar. \n\n\nAugust 2013 (left), November 2013 (middle), February 2014 (right) \n \n\n \nDesign \n\n\nFrom Concept to Reality \n \n\n \nION's magic comes from 40 multicolor LEDs. Each of which can display a color independent of the others. Around these LEDs is a durable acrylic tube, which contains light diffusing film. This smooths out the harshness of the light, while also allowing for the mixing of colors. We designed Ion to be controlled by smartphone, but also wanted users to interact with it by touch. For this reason, we insisted upon aluminum caps precision cut via computer control. Each cap is anodized for a beautiful finish that protects against scratches. Now, changing modes is as simple as tapping the top of ION. It’s one thing to command Ion yourself, but what if ION could put on a light show to your favorite music? We added a microphone and wrote software to do just that. Your Personal Light Show \n\n\nRave (The first of many music moods) \n \n\n \nION loves music as much as you do. With a built in microphone, ION syncs up with your favorite songs and puts on a show. In music mode, each song you play has a unique “color profile” generated on the fly. Low frequencies produce reds, mids produce greens, and highs produce blues. Every time a beat is detected (kick drum, bass, etc), you’ll see a bright pulse of light. Using the app, you can customize the emphasis of each color as you see fit. If you happen to be a musician, you’ll love playing with ION sitting nearby. Rave isn't the only mood that will have music support. We're currently in the process of adding music support to several other moods as well! Choose Your Mood Out of the box, ION ships with more than 15 base moods, each fully customizable with the ION app. Mood options include color, speed, brightness, and several others. Customized moods are saved and stored on your ION. We'll continue adding additional moods as the Kickstarter progresses and after ION ships. Check out a few of our favorites! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more to come! Go Ahead, Touch It Even without a smartphone, ION is easy to use. Simply tap the machined aluminum top to cycle through moods. We call this the rotation . OFF → Solid Light → Mood 1 → Mood 2 → Mood 3 → OFF Using the ION mobile app, you can easily add, remove, and customize moods in your rotation. More detail below. App Control \n\n\n\n\n\nWe currently have a bare bones Android app that can control ION and send it notifications, and a bare bones iOS app. We are now in the process of building both the Android and iOS apps. This includes designing an intuitive UI, graphic design, and software development.   The following features are currently being developed, with more to come. Mood Browser - The mood browser allows you to find new moods and customize them. Swiping up and down on the browser loads in a new mood. You’ll immediately see ION display the selected mood. Many moods also have customizable settings (color, brightness, speed, etc). Just swipe to the left and watch ION change as you play with each setting. Mood Rotation - Out of the box, most moods are accessible by simply tapping the top of Ion. Each tap jumps to the next mood in your rotation. Customizing the moods in this rotation is easy with the ION app. Just find a mood in the mood browser, customize any settings to express your mood, and tap the “add to rotation” button. If the mood is already in your rotation, the “remove from rotation” button will be visible instead. Have as many or as few moods in your rotation as you wish. Shuffle Mode - No need to settle on one mood. Turn on shuffle to have ION switch between moods every few minutes. The shuffle duration can also be configured from the app. Leash mode - Assuming you keep your phone on you, enabling leash mode will allow ION to know if you’re nearby. ION will automatically turn itself on when it detects your presence. Walk away and ION powers itself down to conserve power. Android Notification Bar - Control ION without ever opening the app. Enable notification bar control to turn ION on/off and toggle between moods any time you're near your ION. \n\n\nAndroid Notification Control (Mockup) \n \n\n \nWeather & Time - Using your phone’s Internet connection, ION emulates the weather conditions outside. Or if you prefer, ION will display your daily forecast. Depending on the time of day, you may even see the sun or stars come out. \n\n\n\n\n\nFirmware Updates - We wouldn’t want you to miss out on any new features or moods we add after you receive your ION, so we’ve included the ability to wirelessly apply updates. When the app detects you are running an older firmware version, you’ll be prompted to update to the latest and greatest. Notifications No more wondering if that was just a phantom vibration in your pocket or someone trying to make dinner plans. Link ION with your phone and set a custom notification color and light effect for any of the following: \nText Message \nMultimedia Message \nCalendar Notification \nVoicemail \nGoogle Hangouts \nAlarm Clock \nIncoming Call \nMissed Call \nGmail \nFacebook \nFacebook Messenger \nGoogle Plus \nTwitter \nWhatsApp \nSnapchat \nSkype \nKik \nGoogle Voice \n With support for additional apps in the future! ION will support most iOS and Android devices that ship with Bluetooth Low Energy. Notification Patterns \n\n\n\n\n\nProudly Made in America \n\n\nAluminum Caps on the CNC Mill \n \n\n \nWhen setting out to build ION, we knew we wanted to manufacture and assemble them here in the United States. Being based out of Flint, Michigan, we’ve seen what happens when manufacturing jobs move overseas. There’s no secret formula to why it’s cheaper to build products outside of the US - workers are paid far less than they should be. To help reverse this trend, we are working with many local companies to make ION a reality. \n\nAlro Steel - Flint, MI - Aluminum for Ion’s Caps \nBarch Designs - Port Huron, MI - CNC Machining of Caps \nAmtech Electrocircuits - Troy, MI - Circuit Boards + Assembly \nePlastics - San Diego, CA and/or US Plastic - Lima, OH - Acrylic Tube \n\nMcNichols Polishing & Anodizing Inc - Redford, MI - Anodizing \nLava (that’s us!) - Flint, MI - Final Assembly \n We <3 Developers Interested in controlling ION from your Raspberry Pi, App, or Satellite in Geosynchronous Orbit? We’ve got you covered! In order to create our Try ION website (http://tryion.lava.io ) we began developing a Node.JS library called \"ionode\". Ionode allows you to change modes, trigger notifications, and set configuration parameters of your ION. Currently Ionode is supported on Linux devices with Bluetooth Low Energy. There are several low cost BLE dongles (like this one ) supported by Linux if you don't already have one. Ionode will be released shortly after this Kickstarter on GitHub. We are also building out iOS and Android libraries so that you can build apps that integrate with ION. We can't wait to see what you create! Rewards \n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch - Finalizing base Mood set, begin development of Apps \nApril - Kickstarter Launched, Continued Software Development \nMay - Kickstarter Ends, Orders placed for Components \nJune - Assembly begins \nJuly - Testing of units, Firmware finalized \nAugust - Apps published, First units Delivered \n Risks and challenges When you’re dealing with physical/electrical products, there’s always a risk that a particular component will go out of stock or be discontinued. We’ve done our best to ensure backup suppliers for all of our parts, but delays in delivery are inevitable if any unforeseen circumstances occur. Communication with you, our backers, is always a top priority. We will ensure that if any snags are hit along the way, you are informed and aware of our status.\n\nThat being said, by working with as many local companies as possible, mitigating production delays will occur quickly and efficiently. Both our circuit board assembly and CNC milling partners are located within an hour’s drive of our office. Most of the components sourced for ION come from the United States, shortening the time required for communication with other companies and shipping.\n\nThe next major challenge we face is simultaneously building iPhone and Android applications, giving users the same great ION experience. Due to the different nature of iOS vs. Android's API's, certain features such as notifications and leash mode will be the most complicated to replicate with similar experiences. However, we are confident that our wealth of experience with iOS, Android, and Bluetooth LE will allow us to design and craft an amazing app for both Apple and Android users.

For me, my luck meant getting thrown into a world of handmade pasta and scratch-made sauces, all so good it could make you cry. And believe me, we cried, and laughed, and talked a lot. Loudly.  We're Italian, you know. Between happy shouts and big hand gestures we ate, and loved one another as much as we loved the food. \n\n\nJessica Eating Food and Laughing \n \n\n \n\nI'm not talking about making dorm room noodles. We're going to need a dough sheeter, oven, pots, shelving, and maybe a few spoons. Real food takes real time and money, and that's where you can help. Your donations go directly to building out and equipping a classic ('91) beauty of a truck, and I don't do anything halfway. \n\n\nUncle Gerald Making Manicotti \n \n\n \n\n\nFood is an expression of cultural and personal history. It's instinctual and symbolic, where both biological and spiritual needs can come together. So, do you feed more than just your belly when you eat? We want to bring back a sense of the family-centered dining I grew up with, the kind that sticks with you long after the meal is gone, and can't think of a better place than the dynamic Austin culinary scene. We have the truck and the passion, but now we need the kitchen. You can be a part of that, both on Kickstarter and at the table. If you help us get rolling, there's just one thing left to say: order's up, and welcome to the family! \n\n\nFettuccine Carbonara with Bacon and Egg Yolk \n \n\n \n\n Risks and challenges Our goal here is remodeling and spiffing up a much-loved Chevy step van into a working kitchen. Our ideal workspace includes butcher block countertops, stainless cabinetry, a range, generator, AC units, hood vents, etc. It's going to take time and effort, but fortunately we've got a talented local contractor signed on to the project (who also happens to be family!). \n\nRisks and Challenges:\n- Time constraints: Ideally, we'll be ready to go by SXSW 2013 \n- Staffing: We've got to find some talented, great people to help us expand\n- Location: We're still shopping for an ideal place to set up shop \n\nStrengths and Opportunities:\n- The Jalopy: We've enjoyed sustained success over the last 2 years \n- Patrizi's Restaurant: A Beaumont, TX staple for over 50 years; a track record that's hard to beat for a concept inspiration! \n- Network: We have a great circle of incredibly accomplished, knowledgeable fans, family, and friends to leverage\n- Competition: There just aren't that many great Italian restaurants in Austin\n- Family focus: There aren't many restaurants specifically creating a family atmosphere in this city \n\nWe expect many challenges, as should any newcomer in the food business, but we'll meet them with enthusiasm and confidence. We trust that with your help, Patrizi's can be one of the best Italian eateries Austin has ever seen! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story We are The Awfully Sudden Death of Martha G, and this is our Kickstarter project!  First off, we love you; the fact that you are reading this means more to us than you can know, so thank you, you are a wonderful human being, or other sentient being. \n So, who are we?  The Awfully Sudden Death of Martha G is a four piece rock band from Seattle, Washington making music that is both danceable and meaningful.  With undercurrents of a dark sense of humor and thoughtful insight, tempered with just the right amount of sarcasm, we aim to make sure every song gets stuck in your head for weeks.  We’ve been playing in and around Seattle now for some time going as far south as Portland, and have performed on some of the same stages graced by our rock heros, but I, Patrick, have been writing music since I could speak.  I wrote my first song at the age of three with my cowboy boots (I was in my country phase then) kicked up against the toy box, composing my first ballad of loss, as any good country song would be.  And then, when I started taking guitar lessons at fifteen, I wrote my first string of songs after only a month and knowing only four chords.  Since then I have lived in France and Germany, all of which has influenced me deeply  as a songwriter.  I moved to Seattle just over two years ago from Berlin with a bevy of new material and a burning desire to share those songs with the world.  \n Since then, the Awfully Sudden Death of Martha G has been working really hard to perform the music they love as much and as well as possible.  In addition to this we’ve been writing an enormous amount of new material.  In the four months after the release of our first album alone, I demoed 22 new songs.  These songs are good; they are really good, and we very much want to get them to you, our fans.  That’s where you come in.  We simply don’t have the money to pay for all the recording, mixing, mastering, and everything else that goes into making an album.  \nWith that in mind, we intend to do a six song E.P. featuring our favorites of all the new songs we have written recently.  To do a decent recording and mastering of an album, the bare minimum would be 2,500 American dollars.  It’s what our last album cost, and it’s what we are hoping to raise here.  This time around, we will record a few less songs so we can really focus on making those we do record as stupendous as humanly possible.  With your help, we will enter the studio in February and March, and will have a fully completed album by June of 2013.  In exchange for your help, you will get some wonderful goodies, as well as our eternal gratitude, of course.  Prizes include everything from a digital copy of the new album to special recognition on the album itself, to a foot rub and a party for you and your friends.  If we don’t raise the $2,500 you don’t pay anything, but if we do you get to support local music, which you should feel great about, and get some amazing stuff in return.  For some of you exceptionally rich people out there, it might even count as a tax write-off;  I’m not really sure how that all works.  \n What happens if we raise more than $2,500?  The more money, the better the album; so the more we get, the better the products you receive in return.  If we raise a little over $2500, we will use it to spend more time mixing the album and mastering it, or upgrading the packaging of the albums to the extra, super-wonderful deluxe version.  If we raise a lot over $2,500, let’s say, $5,000, we could make a full length album that would pleasantly massage your eardrums from beginning to end (beginning to end of the album, not beginning to end of your eardrums…well, maybe it would).  Thanks for taking a moment to read this, and I hope by now you are as excited about this project as we are.  If you would like to get to know us a little better first, however, you can see videos of us, and listen to our first album all the way through at awfullysudden.com.   If you want to support us, but quite literally don’t have any money, there are other ways you can help too: post this page on your facebook wall, tweet all about it, write letters to pen pals, go door to door, or basically let everyone you can know about this.  We need as much support as we can get.  Thank you again and we look forward to taking this exciting next step with you.  \n We remain, eternally yours, \nThe Awfully Sudden Death of Martha G Risks and challenges There are several risks and challenges associated with recording an album. Most of these boil down to a lack of experience. Things like, running over time in the studio, not getting the proper mix, or just simply being unprepared for the realities of being in the studio. This won't be a problem for us, however, because I have significant experience with studios and we have already learned the hard lessons on previous albums. We will be fully prepared before recording so that every minute spent in the studio is making the album better, not troubleshooting.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\nLOVERS LOST  is a feature length drama/comedy film about estranged characters through which we explore the universal truths of connection, love, abandon, and the sense of self.  With its romantic and aimless personality, Montreal is the perfect fit for our story. The city itself plays a character in the film. On a personal note, most of the cast and crew have come to call Montreal home. We all want to showcase the charm and character this city has to offer. \n\n\n\n\n\nLOVERS LOST is split into two story lines, both centering on Gabriel , a struggling graphic novelist in his mid-twenties, as he drifts towards and away from those he loves.The film opens as Lorenzo , an eccentric and impulsive childhood friend of Gabriel's, unexpectedly shows up after months of estrangement. As they venture out into the hot, uncertain Montreal night, the film exposes Gabriel's year-long relationship of the previous year, with Julianne , a university lecturer in her mid-twenties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project officially began in September, 2013.

    "textDescription": "Story Dorothy Parker once said, “The first thing I do in the morning is brush my teeth and sharpen my tongue.” The same could be said of the unforgettable characters she wrote. Those characters come to life onstage in “Might As Well Live”, a modern twist on four of Dot’s most hilarious and heartbreaking stories, which will be premiering at the 2015 Hollywood Fringe Festival. Performance dates are June 6 @ 5p ($5 Preview), June 13 @ 7p, June 25 @ 10p, and June 27 @3p, at The Acme Theatre at The Complex, 6470 Santa Monica Blvd. We've also added a fifth performance Sunday, June 14th at 3 PM at Phantom Galleries Los Angeles’s Gallery H, 12619 Hawthorne Blvd., Hawthorne, CA 90250. This Sunday matinee is being produced by the Hawthorne Economic Development Council in associatiation with council president Jason Gromski. “The Lovely Leave” finds Mimi Parker and Steve Parker, husband and wife together for the first time in months — and only for his very brief leave from the Air Force. But will expectations and anticipation ruin what should be a perfectly lovely leave? “You Were Perfectly Fine” recreates a situation most of us have been in but wouldn’t like to admit it: waking up in someone else’s apartment the morning after a wild night and wondering what you did the night before. “New York to Detroit” showcases the devastating breakdown of communication in a long-distance relationship. And the main event of the night: “The Game” drops the audience in the middle of an engagement party, where a charades-like party game leads to devastating and life-changing revelations. Parker’s characters are flawed, vulnerable, wickedly intelligent, screamingly funny, and unsettling familiar. You’ll laugh because you know someone like that, because you’ve been there, and because sometimes there’s nothing else to do in the face of life’s indignities and defeats. Starring: Bailey Wilson, Paul Stanko, Aly Fainbarg, Bret VandenBos, Gabrielle Giraud, Clinton Childress, Kaylon Hunt, and Paget Kagy Directed By: Adam Scott Weissman Sound like a show you want to watch? I hope so... If so, please help us make it happen! Here's how the (estimated) costs break down... \nVenue Costs (Rehearsals, Performances, and Stage Manager Payment): $1,300 \nMarketing / Promotional Materials: $400 \nProps & Costumes: $350 \nKickstarter Backer Rewards: $200 \nPrograms, scripts, and other printing Costs: $300 \nRegistration for Hollywood Fringe Festival: $250 \nRights to Dorothy Parker Short Stories: $200 \n That adds up to our BARE MINIMUM fundraising goal of $3,000... But we are hoping to get more than that so that all the talented actors involved in this production can actually get a little something for their time, creativity, and hard work... And so that maybe we can buy more than 3 props... Risks and challenges We already have our venue secured, we've secured the rights to Mrs. Parker's stories, we've registered for the festival, and we have a cast in place... What could possibly go wrong?\n\nThe rehearsal process is going to involve a lot of hard work from the director and the entire cast. This is a collaborative endeavor and the whole thing lives or dies on how well we all work together, but we have a supremely talented, experienced, and dedicated team who are doing this because we all love Dorothy Parker and can't wait to bring her stories to life.\n\nThe other big challenge is going to be getting butts in the seats. We have 4 performances in a 42-seat theatre, and we intend to fill the theatre every night! This is going to involve a lot of shameless self-promotion on behalf of the cast & director, a lot of careful distribution of flyers, and a lot of creative marketing; to this end, we have already arranged a discount for members of the Los Angeles chapter of the Dorothy Parker Society and are working on other creative promotions.

    "textDescription": "Story Because Kickstarter wont accept my video for some reason, I have uploaded it to youtube. My Project Video Hello! Currently nearly all of the astrophotography that is done today is digital, actually I know of only a few people that still practice this art using traditional formats (aka film). I want to do a revival of film based astrophotography. Using a combination of Medium Format and Large Format cameras to get a view of the skies that is unrivaled in resolution. In the image that I have included as the title image for my project, it is a scanned in medium format (6cm x 7cm) image of a small section of the milky way as taken by the author (and a technical mentor of my project) of Nightfly Photography ; James Cormier. the 4x5 negatives I intend to use will have roughly four and a half times the resoution. To put this into perspective, A raw image file from a 10mp Camera is roughly 25mb. A fully scanned large format 4x5 negative contains over a gigabyte of information. This project site says that this will happen in the town of Tonopah, NV but in reality it will occur at a dark sky site over 80 miles away, so unhindered is this site by man made light pollution that it has been reported on several occasions that the milky way can actually cast visible shadows on the ground. I plan to spend a month in summer during the new moon phase to gather images of the summer milky way as seen from the northern hemisphere (Roughly +90 to -35 Declination) A 300mm Large format Lens (~90mm in 35mm equivalent) for close up constellation images. A 90mm Large Format Lens (~28mm in 35mm equivalent) For wide angle shots milky way. A 90mm Medium Format Lens (~50mm in 35mm equivalent) and a 50mm (28mm in 25mm equivalent)  I plan to use three cameras: \n4x5 Tachihara Field Camera \nMamiya RB67 \nModified Nikon D100 (for exposure proofing) \n I plan to use three kinds of film: \n\nFuji ACROS - A classic black and white film with excellent film characteristics. \n\nKodak E200 - The gold standard of film astrophotography \n\nKodak E100G - A cousin of E200, finer grained higher saturation \n I plan to make ultimately Three forms of art out of all of these negatives. \nLarge Sized Grainless Color Images \n Due to the fact that I no longer have access to the facilities needed to do color darkroom printing all of the color images will be scanned and large sized quality prints on the highest saturated paper I have found: Picterico Pro White. Using a drum scanner the image files will be on the order of gigabytes resulting in unparalleled resolution and clarity. Max Print Size: ~13x19in Large Sized Grainless Darkroom Images  With the large 4x5 negatives that would be produced from this project they could be printed up to 16x20. With only a four times magnification the images would be crystal in sharpness and clarity. Max Print Size: 16x20 \nDaguerreotype Plates This is easily one of the oldest photographic processes and the last time it was used in astrophotography was in the mid 1850s. They were used for pictures of solar eclipses and lunar photography. Using a rather complex process I have found a way to create Daguerreotype Astrophotography Plates. I am limiting how many of these I will make because the last stage in the process (Gilding) is -Very- expensive and I don't think i'll have enough gold chloride to do many prints. The funds I am requesting will go to the purchase of an Equatorial Mount and its related equipment precise enough to have pin point tracking over the -hours- it would take to properly expose an negative (The current mount I have i only good for 5-8 minutes) and the film. Funding Breakdown: \n\nVixen GP2 Equitorial Mount (Needed to counter the earths rotation): 700.00 \n\nGP2 Polar Scope (Needed to accurately align to the NCP): 250.00 \n\nDual Axis Drive DD3 (Needed to guide the telescope on two axis): 430.00 \n\nWeight Shaft Camera Bracket (Needed to mount secondary camera): 90.00 \n\nOrion Starshoot Autoguider (Needed to keep sub arc-second accuracy): 290.00 \n4x5 Kodak E100G Ektachrome Film (Needed for color imaging): 36.00 \n4x5 Fuji ACROS 100 Film (Needed for b/w imaging): 30.00 \n Expect weekly video updates as this project progress and I talk about the various technical issues that come up as I prepare for the project!

As you may have seen already in the video, I have the rare and unique opportunity to record it on some of the highest-quality recording equipment at a state-of-the-art facility, but most importantly, with some phenomenally cool and talented people.  I'm raising funds for the creation, marketing and distribution of the album. Every step of the way is hard work and a learning process, so every little bit makes a huge difference, and I appreciate it more than I can possibly say in words. My art team and I have some really great rewards to share with you as our way of saying thank you! Please feel free to ask any questions, share your thoughts and positive vibes, and the album will hit the airwaves in the best way possible!  Thank you so much! Sincerely, Hector Risks and challenges Throughout the last several years, so many aspects of my life have been devoted to gearing up towards this moment. Since I was about ten or twelve years old when I first picked up a guitar, I have been dreaming of making music and have been actively pursuing it since. My musical journey has taken me through some incredible obstacles, all of which have been an incredible learning experience. \n\nAs it was with the actual writing of the songs, the recording, mixing, and mastering of the music are each in their own way a very involved part of the creative process from which there is always an indescribable amount to learn. If the project is successfully funded, it allows for any of these processes to run more smoothly, as there are always inevitably some speed bumps along the way. With my trusted team, we hopefully don't anticipate too many setbacks in the creation of the project, but it is most certainly always better to be prepared. \n\nIf the project is successfully funded, the more it can actually reach people. The marketing and distribution of the album, after it is recorded, is just as important to the process, so that it delivers on why the music was made in the first place. There will always be challenges, but I am excited to get this music out to the rest of the world! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

The digital files for the art being offered here have already been scanned and prepped to make sure there are no surprises later. The funding goal and pledge levels were carefully determined to take into account the Kickstarter fees, costs of creating the rewards, artist participation, and shipping. We hope to surpass our minimum funding goal, and are offering the 2 highest pledge levels so we will be able to augment our website and delve into the more expensive and time consuming mold making process so we can add sculptures and other 3 dimensional objects to our online gallery.

    "textDescription": "Story STRETCH GOAL One day after we launched this campaign we hit our initial goal! I’m totally stunned and had no idea the project would receive this level of support. Thank you to everyone who made this happen. Our initial goal was fairly conservative—who knew there would be so much interest in a film narrated by a cactus! Finishing the film was my main concern, but there are still plenty of costs involved in promotion and seeking distribution after the film is finished: travel to film festivals; creating promotional materials and a website; publicizing the film; and the legal and licensing fees involved in preparing the film for distribution. Additional funds would also allow me to collaborate with a professional graphic designer to create the text and titles in the film.  If we can raise another $10K ($25K total) all costs from now until the film is distributed will be covered.  Every additional dollar we raise will help the film look better and get it seen by more people.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSYNOPSIS In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador, got lost in Florida. Over the next eight years he wandered, naked, to the Pacific Ocean. He lived among indians and survived by eating the fruit of the prickly pear cactus. He became the first European explorer of Texas and a shaman along the way. When he returned to Spain he wrote a book about his experience. OPUNTIA is a feature length experimental documentary based on the writing of Cabeza de Vaca. To shoot the film, I visited the places de Vaca traveled through on his journey, from St. Petersburg, Florida to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. It was amazing to see what's changed and what remains from nearly five hundred years ago. De Vaca is an unusual, mysterious figure, so I am using unconventional techniques to tell his story: I’m collaborating with a psychic and practicing mediumship to channel the spirit of Cabeza de Vaca—who has chosen to communicate through the prickly pear cacti (known as genus Opuntia in the scientific community), the plant that saved him from starvation as he wandered through the desert for years. \nI want to bring attention to this relatively unknown historical figure and to use de Vaca’s story as a jumping off point for a personal and historical exploration of transformation, spirituality and colonialism. I’m interested in the ways de Vaca's story bridges past and present; fact and fiction; and the material and spiritual worlds. This crazy project that has lived in my imagination for years is close to becoming a reality. I can't wait to share it with the world. Please help me get through this final phase of the process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n GOAL The film is 100% shot, thanks in part to a grant from the Austin Film Society , and is currently being edited. Your contribution will be used to finish post production. Specifically, your donation will finance: a sound designer to create a rich audio environment; a composer to create original music for the film; transfer of super 8mm film to video; color correction; output to DCP; and festival submission fees. INSPIRATION References for this project come from both books and movies––I was inspired by works that blend the historical, personal and natural, and look for radical ways to tell a story or present an idea. These are some of the works that have influenced the project: Rebecca Solnit’s book A Field Guide to Getting Lost ; Michael Ondaatje’s books The Collected Works of Billy the Kid and Coming Through Slaughter ; Paul Cox's film Vincent ; Chris Marker’s film Sans Soleil ; and Patricio Guzmán’s film Nostalgia for the Light . \n\nDIRECTOR BIO I use film/video to explore how the personal, historical, natural, and metaphysical relate to each other. I spend a long time, often years, getting to know the people and places I make films about. My feature films (TRONA and PINCUS ) and short films have screened at festivals and museums around the world including the Sundance Film Festival and The Museum of Modern Art. PINCUS was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. My short film WOOD won Best Documentary Short at the Los Angeles Film Festival and is now streaming on POV . As a cinematographer I’ve shot films for other directors, including MONICA AND DAVID for Ali Codina which aired on HBO and was nominated for an Emmy. I’ve taught film and video courses at the University of California San Diego and the California Institute of the Arts. In 2011 I was an artist in residence at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, TX, where I now live and work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges The film is completely shot, so the most difficult challenges are behind us. Once the remaining funds are raised, the biggest challenge will be to finish editing the film and work with the composer and sound designer to create a rich soundscape to compliment the visuals.

We contacted a talented artist called Anton Back who turned our fevered ramblings into some awesome concept art and then we commissioned a favourite sculptor of ours by the name of Duncan Louca who took the concept art and turned it into the digital sculpts you see on your screen. Awesome guys!  Help us to bring our range of awesome terrain to the tabletop. In return for your help backers will receive STL files (pledge dependent) that you can either print from home on your personal 3d printer or you can perhaps use a 3D vendor that offers a 3D printing service. 3D printers have become rather cost effective over recent years and an excellent printer like the Prusa i3 MK2 can be pruchased for hundreds rather than thousands. Gaming clubs have found it cost effective to group purchase a printer for all of their gaming needs to host club nights and tournaments for a fraction of the cost of buying physical terrain at retail. See our FAQ page for more info on how and where you can have your STL files printed for you at a fraction of the cost of resin or plastic scenery. Backing this kickstarter at pledge level will grant you a personal licence to print our terrain and once you have the STL files you can print as many copies as you like!  (see Terms and Conditions below) Join the digital terrain revolution today and back The Shattered Shards.  Better terrain to really bring your battles in the various realms to life. Take a look at our awesome terrain. Pledging on Kickstarter.  Remember, that on Kickstarter your card is only charged if the Kickstarter funds and then the funds are only charged to your card shortly after the Kickstarter deadline finishes. So feel free to pledge away early as the sooner we fund, the sooner we can unlock stretch goals for more terrain (including some planned freebies!) and your card won't be charged until the day the Kickstarter ends.  We currently have no plans for a retail release of these items. The quickest (and cheapest!) way to pick up these files is to get them via this KS. Printing Files?   For those with a 3d printer already (and many own a printer nowadays) this is a simple task of waiting for the files to be sent and then using your printer's software to print the files at your preferred resolution.  3d printers are getting faster, better and importantly, cheaper all the time. A very good 3d printer can be purchased for £600-£1000. For a gaming group a 3d printer can solve all of your terrain issues and you can cheaply obtain files for epic fantasy terrain (us!), castles, dungeons, space corridors, walkways, sci-fi buildings and gantries - all for much cheaper than it costs to buy expensive resin or plastic terrain. For a large gaming group or someone that puts on a lot of tournaments a printer is an investment that soon pays off! For those without a printer - we have a vendor lined up by the name of Garry . He is UK based and has a LOT of experience printing wargaming terrain. Indeed he has his own range of terrain that he offers for sale. You can ask him questions via @garrisimo on Twitter or his email  he offers his items for sale on the website ageofhobby.com so you can see the quality of his wares. We will include contact details for Garry in every pledge.  \n\n\nA sample print from Garrisimo \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nSample print of the large and medium Shattered Shards by Garrisimo. GW minis for scale comparison only. \n \n\n \n\nFor those based elsewhere there is the option to use 3dhubs.com the beauty of this is that you can upload the files to your account and then choose a local vendor (cheaper shipping and no import taxes!)that prints in FDM material  and you can see all available prices, resolutions and shipping times from dozens of vendors and choose which you prefer!  THE SHATTERED SHARDS PLEDGE LEVEL  Powered by fell majicks from a sundered world these Shards have floated through time and space and are naturally drawn to areas high in magic or death.  \n\n\nAll three Shattered Shards \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Shattered Shards pledge level includes all 3 Shattered Shards seen above. The smallest is a mighty 150mm diameter ( 150mm = surface of floating rock) the medium is 200mm and the largest a mighty 300mm (that's a foot across!), large enough to hold a mighty miniature such as GW's Archaon! Of course, you could always adapt the STL files via your printer software for a smaller or larger piece. The files have been optimised for printing and can be printed in multiple parts for a smaller printer or as a single piece for larger printers (apart from the 300mm Shard which is in two parts)  You will need to source some clear acrylic rod for the floating effect. The holes for the rods to fit in are pre-sculpted onto the files so you can just slot them straight in with no hassles! These rods can be sourced at a very reasonable price (around £1 for an 150mm length) on eBay. The scenic rock bases are very sturdy but you may wish to mount them on a piece of MDF or suchlike for extra stability. THE CALVACADE OF DEATH PLEDGE LEVEL This includes the following The Corpse Citadel The Deathfast Span The Mortis Haunt Note that in some images below the Shattered Shards are also included - these Shards are not included in this level - if you want both sets together please choose the 'Immortal Realms of Death' pledge level. \n\n\nThe Corpse Citadel \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nCorpse Citadel on the largest Shattered Shard \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCorpse Citadel on the largest Shattered Shard \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nCorpse Citadel - detail view \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nA Deathfast Span detail view \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMore Span and Shards goodness! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCrossing a Deathfast SPan guarded by a Mortis Haunt is a daunting task! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMortis Haunt combined with Shards and a Deathfast Span \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe Mortis Haunt (seen here in conjunction with Shards and a Deathfast Span \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDeathfast Span \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDeathfast Span \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe Deathfast Span across 2 Shattered Shards \n \n\n \n\n\n   IMMORTAL REALMS OF UNDEATH PLEDGE LEVEL  This pledge level contains both the Shattered Shards and Calvacade of Death pledge levels (at a bundle saving price!) and also is eligible for all applicable stretch goals.  Currently this level is eligible for the following free stretch goals (see update #1-4 for more info)  \n\n\nThe Immortal Redoubt \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Shattered Stair. The 2nd free terrain file added for 'Immortal Realms of Undeath' pledge level backers. \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRiver of Lost Souls - free! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDeathgate.

A FREE file for all Immortal Realms of Undeath & Commercial backers when we reach £4.6k \n \n\n \n\n Note that images are subject to small alterations to optimise printing. How big are they really though?  Here's an image of the smallest (150mm) Shard (note that the figure in the image is copyright Games Workshop and is used for scale purposes only. The GW figure is on a 40mm round base) \n\n\nScale reference. Small (150mm diameter) Shard \n \n\n \n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\nWhen you contribute to This campaign, you will receive STL files for the models as per your selected pledge. The pledge files will be delivered December 2017, with any successful stretch goals arriving later (see relevant stretch goals for further dates).\n\nYou can print these files for your personal use, but you may not sell the printed items or distribute the digital 3D models/files to other parties. We are happy for you to print and sell the models (at cost) to your friends and club members or even to print off a load of copies for a gaming tournament you may be hosting, but you can't go into business selling or distributing the models for profit or publicly advertise that you print and sell the models in any way whatsoever. Backers of the 'Immortal Realms Commercial Licence' may distribute the items printed from ANY files that they receive as a part of this Kickstarter for profit. They may not distribute or sell the files .  We're on Kicktraq - check the progress here http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/immortalrealms/the-shattered-shards-3d-printable-fantasy-war-game/ Risks and challenges All of the files for the Shattered Shards and Calvacade of Death pledges are complete and ready to go. We hope to unlock further terrain elements once we are funded and we will need our sculptor to complete these works for us.\n\nWe have an excellent working relationship with our sculptor and there are no language barriers and work has always been carried out for us in a timely fashion. For any additional pieces of terrain we fund we will set a realistic date for delivery and factor in a possible delay (and strive to deliver early)\n\nAs there is no need to ship STL files the only real risk would be if our PC and hard drive/USB was corrupted or destroyed in some way but even in that case we have the files uploaded to a cloud based server and the sculptor also still has the original files so they are in multiple locations.

If any issue arises with one part of our chain, we have a second option to work with so it will not affect our deadline and the rest of production. Of course with every big project, there may be some unforeseeable challenges, but we have done our very best to prevent a setback with production and have action plans in place for any issue that may arise. \nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!

And today, Knot Theory is back, to bring you a fun project we have in the works: The Mustache Bow Tie. Growing a mustache is not your thing? The mustache bow tie is perfectly shaped to sit in front of your neck, to give you that mustache feeling without having to grow one. It will not strain your soup. It will not dust your cookie. It will not tickle your lady. If you are someone who enjoys a hearty bowl of chunky soup, and your cookies are usually dust-free, and your ladies don't like to be tickled with a broom, then get a mustache bow tie! Mo Bros and Mo Sistas who grow wispy, thin staches, or none at all, can also keep it smooth with a Mo Bow. Project Goal Our goal is to get at least 50 bow ties ordered on KickStarter. By preparing a batch instead of cutting out the bow ties one by one, we will be able to price these Mo Bows mo betta! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore photos: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Levesque (co-owner of shopmasc.com) \n \n\n \n\n About Knot Theory Knot Theory is a fashion label whose primary goal is to bring innovative and quality designs to everyday life.

    "textDescription": "Story ABOUT ME Hello everyone, my name is Juan Pedraza and I'm an indie game developer who wants to bring amazing videogames to the market. I have two years of experience with Unity but almost 10 years with other engines and tools. You can see more of my work on my portfolio here: https://juanpedrazadeveloper.wordpress.com/ THE GAME & STORY FULL RESOLUTION TEASER \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Prelude is a psychological horror survival game, where you play as a guy who wakes up in a mysterious town, not having any idea of who he is and where he is. Going from house to house, from place to place dealing with many horrid things along the way trying to find a way out. \n\n\n. The focus on this game is not using the same route as other classic horror games but to do something new (or at least that's what i want), give you the feeling of hopelessness and fear of the unknown and unfathomable. Trying to survive in this world that was once the place you called home, completely isolated from friends and family, stuck in this infinite loop of despair and fear just looking for a way out of what you could call a nightmare. \n\n\n. You will have to figure out ways to overcome obstacles and also venture into the deepest darkness in order to advance, the game doesn't just focus on creatures chasing after you, it also focus on making you lose your mind, slowly and steadily. Every inch of this game will attempt to crawl under your skin and make you feel like you're in a living nightmare. \n\n\n. The game will not just have random horror elements, each element will have a story, meaning or a hidden message that might either tell you more about the character's story, give you clues to advance through the game or tell you something... darker. The game will attempt to make you feel many kinds of horrors, including those of phobias, the feeling of being watched, of being chased, that your death is close and will be inevitable, make you feel like you're nothing but a tiny being in the vast sea of infinity. All the journey will get worse as you move forward and the player will eventually see the truth... and the rest is for you to find out for yourself. \n\n\nTHE CHARACTERS . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n. You play as a \"regular\" guy who wakes up in the town, there won't be (yet) any support characters to help you along the way, however, you won't be alone, there will be creatures who will make you to break you and fall into madness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Each creature holds a meaning, either in looks or their actions, even their behavior will tell you something that might or might not be important. ART & DESIGN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Most of the game takes place in a urban/suburban environment, there will be points of the game in which the environment will look pretty normal, however, there will be times where they are going to have a touch of surrealism and other indicators to let you know something's wrong... really wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n. The environment itself will show you more of the story and character's background as well as where the story is heading, you need to keep an eye to the surroundings at all times. Not all levels will be an open world however, some of them will enclose you to narrow hallways, inside buildings or even natural environments out of town like a forest. All of it with a meaning. PROJECT STATUS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n. The project is still development BUT with the first working Pre-Alpha Demo, which will be available really soon, the demo is fully functional and will give you a very small taste of what the final version of the game will provide. The demo is COMPLETE now, just two days ago I paid for the Steam fee of $100usd to get this game into the store, however, unbeknownst to me, I have to wait 30 DAYS in order to actually upload the game , right now I'm waiting for my tax document to be checked and approved so I can, at last, work on the \"Coming Soon\" page where the game will be for sale. The demo should be up and ready for sale almost at the same time the campaign ends. The next stage is get from there onto the next release which will have bug (if any) fixes of the current Pre-Alpha Demo Side Story and add more side stories leading to the final release. One thing to note is that all the videos on this campaign are from the Demo itself. THE BUDGET This first demo is all thanks to the amazing people who supported me on the first kickstarter campaign, thanks to them I managed to raise $633usd which allowed me to get assets, textures and tools/software purchase/subscription that allowed me to work on this game really fast and have the first demo ready in a few months. I have a lot of experience in game design and programming but they were the ones who allowed me to get this project off the ground, their names are already carved into the game for the world to see soon enough. Having said that, while that amount was perfect to get this project off the ground, it's not quite enough to work on what comes next, this demo is quite long and with a decent-sized town, but it's nothing but the tip of the iceberg, the final game will be HUGE, so I'm gonna need more funding to work on this project, at least to make it have the quality I want it to have. The main goal of this campaign will be reaching enough funding to work on new levels for the Pre-Alpha version, further funding will be directed towards the development of the main game. The funding will be used for assets, subscriptions for software to make my life easier, more textures and hopefully someone to help me with marketinng. Here's a more detailed list: \n\n$5,000mxn: Work on first demo debugging and add more Pre-Alpha levels before final release. \n\n$15,000mxn: Upgrade my desktop computer to be able to work efficiently on the next stage, even if the game is optimized for anyone to play it, I still have to deal with the non-optimized build in Unity's editor, a new graphic card and processor will boost my work's speed. \nAnything beyond that will be directed towards the final game's development. \n\nBUT, if my funding reaches over 100k, I'm gonna donate 10% to charities for those who were victims of the recent earthquakes and hurricanes, a lot of my fellow people died in those disasters and it really breaks my heart to see them go through this, I already donated some food and money but I will be able to help even more if this reaches over 100k. \n THE REWARDS Every reward tier is just amazing, even the lowest tier reward will give you access to the game, saving a least 75% compared to the retail price the game will have. Other tiers will give you access to credits into the game as well as other benefits. The higher rewards, however, are gonna give you something more special, give you the chance of having YOUR HOUSE exterior (or even exterior/interior) in the game, obviously having an important role in it so people have to go to them. IMPACT OF YOUR HELP I can finish this game on my own, but with your help things will go smoother and faster. I'm gonna be able to put more work into everything I do, this will result in a game with MUCH higher quality since I'm gonna be able to put attention to every detail. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING will be as polished as it can be for your best horror gaming experience. SOCIAL MEDIA If you want to know more about this game or my work in general please contact me on any of my social media and follow me on them, if you can't/don't want to become a backer but still love the game then please spread the word, show this game to friends, family or followers you have, everything helps. Here are my social media links: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JEPRGameAppDev/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/jepr_derelict YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/ChBgt909 Portfolio: https://juanpedrazadeveloper.wordpress.com/ OTHER PLEDGING METHODS If you're like me and want to have your rewards quicker then here's an alternative way to pledge, this is my PayPal.me link for you to make a transfer, just make sure to MESSAGE ME once you pledge through here: https://www.paypal.me/jepr909 THANK YOU Thank you all for taking the time to read everything I had to say, I hope you like this game and support it, I also want to thanks Kickstarter for giving people like me the chance to achieve our dreams <3 Thank you all. Risks and challenges The risk here is taking too long to deliver updates and new content, I work really fast, but I can't have control of everything that happens around me, so delays can happen.\n\nMy challenge, however, will be to have the final version of the game before summer of 2018, with many new levels and content being released monthly prior to that.

Tijdens mijn val belandde ik op een sneeuwbrug die mijn leven heeft gered, want de gletsjerspleet was minstens 50 meter diep.”\n(uit: Een leven lang flow)  Inmiddels zijn we 7 jaar vanuit Insight Adventure professioneel en succesvol bezig met het geven van trainingen, coaching en lezingen. Klanten van ons zijn gerenommeerde organisaties en particulieren. Missie & visie. Een grote wens is altijd al geweest om mijn kennis en ervaring te delen middels het schrijven van een boek. Ik geloof namelijk en ervaar dit steeds weer dat we als mens zoveel meer kunnen dan dat we vaak denken of ons voorgehouden wordt. Hiermee bedoel ik op verschillende niveaus, mentaal, fysiek, emotioneel en intuïtief. En hoe je hiermee aan de slag kunt gaan, daar gaat dit boek over. In 'Een leven lang FLOW' wordt je uitgedaagd om het heft in eigen handen te nemen gecombineerd met ervaringsverhalen en praktische oefeningen om het direct in de praktijk te kunnen toepassen. Het doel is om vanuit Innerlijke vrijheid in het leven te staan, waardoor je de flow bewust stimuleert. \n Omdat ik iedereen een leven lang flow toewens, ben ik dit project gestart om zoveel mogelijk mensen te bereiken en dit middels het uitgeven van het boek \"Een leven lang FLOW\". Mede door het geven van lezingen, masterclasses, trainingen en coaching kan ik deze missie extra kracht bijzetten.Wat levert het jou op? Als je blij wordt van deze informatie en je staat ervoor open om meer uit jezelf en je leven te halen, dan nodig ik je van harte uit om me te steunen in dit crowdfunding project. Alleen tijdens deze campagne van 23 dagen (7 t/m 30 oktober) gelden er speciale aanbiedingen, waardoor het voor jou extra interessant is. Deze zogenaamde Rewards (aanbiedingen) beginnen vanaf € 7,- en lopen op tot het maximum bedrag van € 1995,-. Uiteraard is bij iedere reward (vanaf de  € 25,- reward) het boek 'Een leven lang FLOW' inbegrepen.Als Kick-off bonus geldt t/m dinsdag 11 oktober een extra boek bij deze reward!

Alleen t/m 11 oktober geldig!!!  Wil je liever met iDeal betalen?  Als je niet met een credit card kunt betalen kan ik je ook een betaallink mailen met het gewenste bedrag wat je wilt investeren. Via die betaallink kun je dan met iDeal betalen. Je kunt hiervoor mailen naar info@eenlevenlangflow.nu. Omdat we het boek in eigen beheer uitgeven, hebben we het doel gesteld om € 10.000,- te crowdfunden wat nodig is om de boeken te laten drukken, PR te doen en voor de opmaak van het boek.. En last, but not least! Per verkocht exemplaar gaat er 1 euro naar een project wat bijdraagt aan een duurzame wereld. Kortom: € 1,- for a better planet. De eerste donatie zal gaan naar giro 5125 voor het Rode Kruis en de hulp aan Haïti waar helaas net weer een natuurramp heeft plaatsgevonden. Als er 2000 exemplaren zijn verkocht doneren wij dus € 2000,- aan giro 5125.Super bedankt voor je bijdrage en tot ziens op de boekpresentatie, lezing, masterclass of training!Enjoy the moment,\nEvert HeintzWim Hof (the Iceman) over het boek. \"Diepte maakt het verschil.

As a trainer, coach and inspirational speaker I am honoured to run my own company Insight Adventure for already 7 years now. My clients are larger companies and als private people who are interested how to improve the flow in their work and/ or life. My big wish has always been to write a book about the subject flow and how you can influence this in your own life. I believe and I experience that more often that we as a human being can do so much more than we have learned for example in school. I mean on different levels, mentally, fysically, emotionally and intuitively. Because I wish everyone the best in their life I have started this crowdfunding project to reach the people who are open to explore their own infinite possibilities. If you are getting happy about my mission and vision I would like to invite you to cooperate in this crowdfunding project 'Een leven lang FLOW'.Because I am publishing the book on my own account I have the focus to crowdfund the amount of € 10.000,- for printing the books, PR and for styling the book.And last, but not least!

They are made to bring happiness. They are about the feeling that you have, when you put on your favourite pair. They are about the feeling that you have, when you see your loved one in something beautiful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea Boots for quality loving people is not just another phrase to us. We started Fernando Berlin in 2010, making high quality leather boots, in Europe, to an affordable price. In 2012 we started to make boots made to measure. The idea: the customers can pick their shoe size, measure their legs at home, order online and get the boots delivered to the doorstep. Legs are as individual as people themselves. They vary in length and width. We wanted to make the Fernando Berlin feeling available to everyone. No matter how tall, how small or what your scale tells you, you are beautiful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Skills We developed a unique measuring system , that is easy enough for everyone to measure at home. You can choose the width you need and  the length that you prefer, from knee high until right up to the cheek. Not to forget, you can choose the color, too. If customers have special wishes, we have the flexibility to make them true. Over the years we gathered considered experiences that are unique in the business. We love to work hard and smart and our secret ingredient is the love to our product. \n\n\nHow we measure \n \n\n \n\n\nWe the people We started our company with ideas and heart only. In five years, we have created several jobs and made thousands of people happy by sending them our gorgeous boots. We believe in creating a working enviromnent, where you enjoy working every day. It is important that everyone who works at Fernando Berlin gets fair salary, respect, trust and the freedom to rise to his best. Our workers don't have managers, as they are fully capable of managing themselves. At Fernando Berlin everyone does real work. There is nothing more satisfying, then to call it a day with the feeling of: \"I got it done\". We love to create and we are proud of our work. \n\n\nour Atelier \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Project At the moment a made to measure boot takes about 4-6 weeks. We want to bring the production time down to 1 week. This is nothing less than a revolution in the made to measure business. With your support, we can achieve this. We need to employ more people, who will need the right tools and machinery. They will need about 20 machines and tools. At the core is a mounting machine, that is dedicated to our made to measure boots. With this machine, a skilled worker will be able to bring the upper and the last together and turn the 2 dimensional leathers into a 3 dimensional boot. Further more, there will be presses, stamping machine, a hydrolic last puller, a steaming machine an much more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche Übersetzung Unsere Mission \n\"Boots are made for walking\", aber Fernando Berlin Stiefel sind noch viel mehr. Unsere Stiefel sind da, um Freude zu bereiten. Sie sind für das Gefühl, das man bekommt, wenn man seine Lieblingsschuhe anzieht. Sie sind für das Prickeln im Bauch, das man fühlt, wenn man den Partner oder die Partnerin in einem wundervollen Outfit sieht. \n \n  Die Idee\n  \"Wenn Sie Qualität mögen, werden Sie unsere Stiefel lieben.\", ist nicht nur eine Phrase für uns. Wir haben 2010 Fernando Berlin gegründet, mit dem Ziel hochwertige Lederstiefel aus europäisch Fertigung zu einem fairen Preis herzustellen. 2012 haben wir begonnen unsere Stiefel als Maßanferttingung anzubieten. Die Idee: die Kunden könnnen Zuhause ihre Schuhgröße auswählen, ihre Beine ausmessen, online bestellen und bekommen ihre Stiefel direkt nach Hause geliefert. Beine sind so verschieden wie die Menschen selbst, sie sind unterschiedlich groß und unterschiedlich breit. Wir wollten allen Menschen das Fernando Berlin Gefühl ermöglichen, jeder Mensch kann schön sein, egal wie groß, wie klein oder wie breit. \n \n Unser Können\n Wir haben ein einzigartiges Maßsystem entwickelt, dass es jedem ermöglicht selber zuhause zu messen. Man kann die Stiefellänge wählen die man möchte und die Weite die man braucht. Nicht zu vergessen, die Farbe kann man auch auswählen. Auch für spezielle Sonderwünsche finden wir oft Lösungen. Über die letzten Jahre haben wir Erfahrungen gesammelt, die Einzigartig in der Branche sind. Wir arbeiten intelligent und mit Leidenschaft, aber unsere Geheimzutat ist die Liebe zu unserem Produkt.     Das Team\n Wir haben unsere Firma mit Herz und einer Idee. Innerhalb von fünf Jahren konnten wir einige Arbeitsplätz erschaffen und haben tausende  von Kunden glücklich gemacht, indem wir Ihnen unsere Stiefel geschickt haben. Wir glauben an ein Arbeitsumfeld indem man gerne arbeitet. Für uns ist es wichtig das jeder der bei Fernando Berlin arbeitet ein faires Gehalt bekommt, Respekt, Vertrauen und die Freiheit um sein Bestes geben zu können. Unsere Mitarbeiter werden nicht gemanagt, da Sie in der Lage sind sich selbst zu managen. Bei Fernando Berlin leistet jeder echte Arbeit.  Für uns gibt es nichts schöneres, als mit dem Gefühl in den Feierabend zu gehen, als mit Gefühl etwas geschaffen zu haben. Wir sind gerne kreativ und sind stolz auf unsere Arbeit.  \n  \n Das Projekt \nZur Zeit dauern es ca. 4-6 Wochen um einen Maßstiefel herzustellen und zu liefern. Wir wollen die Produktionszeit auf eine Woche verkürzen. Dies ist nicht weniger also eine Revolution im Maßanfertigungsgeschäft.  Mit eurer Unterstützung können wir das schaffen. Um unser Ziel zu erreichen müssen wir neue Leute einstellen und ihnen die Werkezeuge und Maschinen geben die sie benötigen. Insgesamt brauchen wir ca. 20 neue Maschinen. Das Hertzstück bildet einen Montagemaschine, die nur für unsere Maßanfertigungen reserviert ist. Mit dieser Maschine kann ein Facharbeiter das Oberleder und den Leisten zusammenführen. So wird ein Schuh daraus. Dazu benötigen wir noch Pressen, hydraulische Leistenzieher, Bedampfmaschinen und noch einige mehr \n \n Risks and challenges We have been successful in the business for 5 years and we see this project as the next logical step. We have been planning this expansion for 1 1/2 years. We have the offer from the company, where will buy our tools and machinery and provide the maintenance. Also we have done all the necessary paperwork.\n\nWe understand, that there are risks, especially when it comes to dealing with 3rd parties. That is why we only work together with suppliers with a long reputation. \nExperience told us, that projects never come without unforeseen obstacles. Delays can happen and we have calculated them in as good as possible. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

My life's work, in it's entirety (well, mostly the good stuff) can be all yours for the shockingly low donation cost of a single, lousy buck!!! Sound stupid? Well, it probably is. Hell, I never made it as a musician, and at 40 (something) years old, my family is starting to giggle openly in front of me (not behind my back like they used to do) and that's pretty hardcore, if you ever failed at your life's calling. It's not that I stink as a musician and songwriter, or at least, I don't think so, but I AM getting older, and chasing a dream is never easy, former landlords, employers and creditors haven't exactly shared my ambitions... Anyway, what have you got to lose? For a buck you could do a heck of a lot worse! Donate Now! So get out that debit card and make a pledge, even though service fees and bank charges might cost you more than the actual donation, you will be excited when you finally get to download my ENTIRE CATALOG of original tunes ranging in genres from rock to blues to ambient and then back to rock, and maybe some more blues and then rock again and other stuff too! Now, I've thought this through (so to speak) and I am going to post samples of my work so you can see I'm not (just) a fruitcake. You will see that I am an extraordinarily accomplished musician (thank you very much) songwriter and artist, and you will then ask yourself \"Why is this guy not lighting up the charts??? or maybe you will just sorta listen to bits of my stuff and say \"Well that was a ripoff\", but cripes, it's a measly  buck for Jupiter's sake! What do you want? Barry Manilow? All this for a dollar??? \"How does he do it?\" you might ask, well, lemme tell ya. Being a pathetically desperate middle aged musical failure, not to mention a bit of a social misanthrope and a little fat, it's easy for me to find the sincere and uninhibited generosity (ok, r e a l l y fat) deep within my heart that makes me want to share my creation with the world (hell, I can't give this stuff away, seriously) and that's why I want YOU to have the opportunity to get in on the ground level of a campaign that is simply TOO SMALL TO FAIL. But don't just take MY word for it... here's what some other (mostly bribed) folks, that I never, ever met before have to say: \"Bill R? Yeah, I think I remember him...he used to wash dishes at the Black Angus in Yakima, is he still there?\" -Kent M from Detroit \" Hellava guitar player, son of a b***** still owes me $200. You got his address? -Steve D, from Dallas \"He's kinda like a real good musician and stuff, but he's pretty old, isn't he? -Shelly from Long Island \"My dog didn't even like him\" - Mike S from Seattle \"This guy is awesome! Best Pizza Delivery guy around\" - Bryan from Asheville \"You have his #??? We've been trying to find him for a long time\" -Detective B Sharpton, Los Angeles But wait! Don't Donate Just Yet! Just kidding. DONATE NOW! PLEASE! For the love of god! I need bus money! New shoes, socks, food...I got a disconnection notice on my cable for cryin' out loud!

Life is a crap shoot anyhow, right??? Right!\n\nSo basically, if I don't raise a single dollar, that's going to be pretty damn embarrassing. Almost pathetic, if you think about it...\n\nSure, I've lost all remnants of self respect and I'm pretty much begging, but I don't feel toooo awful bad taking your money since I spent the majority of my life (mostly) selflessly trying to make the world a better place with my music. I work hard at my craft, and it's been a lot of fun (well, jail wasn't fun...) and to be able to have a shot at sharing my creation with people and animals that love music is worth ANY risk or challenge.

    "title": "LittleRP - Affordable Flexible Open 3D Resin Printer",
    "processed": true,

    "videoLength": 247,
    "descriptionMediaNumber": 29,
    "textLength": 24469,
    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy LittleRP?\n The LittleRP was created to be a standardized and affordable open solution for resin printing. FFF printers like the Darwin, Mendel, and Prusa significantly lowered the barriers to entry for makers looking to get into 3D printing. The LittleRP aims to offer similar benefits by providing an easily self-sourced / expandable resin printer to the emerging resin printer community.  At the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign LittleRP.com will become a primary source for those who would rather purchase an already sourced, high quality, well documented kit. From the beginning the LittleRP was designed to be as simple as possible while still maintaining excellent print quality. By focusing cost constraints on the components that most directly impacted printing quality we were able to create a kit that has high accuracy, performance and detail while keeping costs low. Our mission is to bring highly detailed resin printing to the makers, model builders, and jewelers for whom current offerings do not meet affordability, simplicity, or accuracy needs. What is Resin Printing? \"Resin printing\" (also known as 3D stereolithography) is a printing process which uses a liquid light-sensitive resin and a high intensity light source to build a 3-dimensional part, layer by layer. It is different from traditional FFF-technology that most are familiar with as instead of extruding hot filament in a linear pattern, the liquid resin is turned into a solid using light, with layers completed at much faster rates. Light sources used for this type of printing are typically a +2000 lumen DLP projector or a near-UV laser and subsequently yield parts with much higher quality and detail than is possible with FFF technology. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ABOVE: Even at an identical .1mm layer height, resin printing is capable of superior detail and accuracy reproduction [Marvin Keychain by 3D Hubs / Thing:215703 ) Design Progression \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple design of the LittleRP doesn't tell the full story of its development. Designed over several months and iterations the LittleRP has evolved from a one off fully printed machine to a production friendly printer of refined design. The three fundamentals of the LittleRP Affordability - While currently there is an influx of resin printers becoming available on the market there still remain relatively few inexpensive options. The LittleRP was specifically designed to be both affordable to acquire, and inexpensive to operate. By focusing on smaller higher detailed prints, we were able to shrink and simplify the resin vat design, which dramatically decreased replacement vat, re-coat, and resin costs.  Replacement vats are normally a costly item, with the LittleRP our replacement vats will be offered for a fraction of the price of other printers. The non-stick coating of the LittleRP resin vats only requires $1 of material to re-coat compared to $8-10 for larger printers. Lastly our build plates have been designed to be strong, easy to swap, and to use inexpensive aluminum extrusions.  Flexibility - The LittleRP is unique among resin printers in that it was designed to encourage 3rd party vat designs, linear motion components, and DLP light sources. If availability issues arise or extra performance is desired, the LittleRP design is meant to be flexible to fit a variety of needs. For example, the linear rail can be swapped out for OpenBuilds V-Slot parts, the projector for different or higher resolution models, and a variety of stepper / leadscrew / leadscrew nut options can also be used.  Openness -  At the Kickstarter conclusion the design files for the LittleRP will be made available on GitHub, this means you will have access to every STL, every measurement, every lasercut file, as well as BOM and build documentation. Do you want to modify the design? Does your makerspace want to do a self-sourced group build? We are happy to help you with any questions you may have.  Our philosophy with resins is to test as many 3rd party resins as possible and make recommendations based on price and performance. Our open stance means that you won’t be locked into costly proprietary resins.  Tested Resin Choices\n Below are two resin options that have been thoroughly tested and recommended for the LittleRP printer. Most UV curing resins compatible with DLP based resin printers are likely to work with the LittleRP. One of the goals of the LittleRP campaign is to test new resin options as they become available and encourage further resin development. MadeSolid Resins - MadeSolid's Deep Red formulation is an excellent choice for those looking for an easy to use consistent resin with minimal shrink, retaining accuracy with both large and small models. Because MadeSolid Deep Red shows less layer blending it appears best at 50micron layer heights as it better matches the XY resolution. MadeSolid Deep Red requires longer to fully clean from vats and build plates and is only available in the Deep Red color.Price: $59 / 500ml - $99 / 1000ml \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ( ABOVE:  3D KitBash Skull [MadeSolid Resin]) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ( ABOVE:  Super Hero Head by Terry Nghe [MadeSolid Resin]) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( ABOVE:  Open Source Hardware Ring by DjSplitterPro / Thing:358031 [MadeSolid Resin]) MakerJuice Resins - MakerJuice SubSF for LittleRP resins are vibrantly colored and tailored for use with the LittleRP. MakerJuice SubSF for LittleRP is available in a variety of colors and is ideal for 50-100micron layer heights where both detail and layer blending are desired. MakerJuice SubSF for LittleRP is easy to modify for specific printing needs due to it's easy color mixing and availability of raw pigments. Mixing pigments allows for custom colors and for tuning to 25-50micron layer heights. 'SF' stands for snap fit and is suitable for items that require or benefit from some flexibility. MakerJuice SubSF for LittleRP exhibits some shrink and will benefit from hollowing of more solid models before printing. MakerJuice SubSF for LittleRP is also a very easy to clean from vats and build plates. The Deep Red coloration is recommend for the finest of detail work as it is the best at blocking UV.

The Complete kit includes everything you need to get printing, whereas the Projectorless option requires you to supply your own DLP projector. The recommended choices and options for a projector can be found in the “Projector Options” section further down.Projectorless kits are available for worldwide shipping, due to different countries power requirements, regulations as well as the fragility of projector bulbs, we are not offering complete kits outside of the US at this time.Projectorless Without  Printed Parts means that the kit does not include the red FFF printed PLA pieces in the photo above. This option is for those who already have an FFF printer and wish to print these parts themselves and obtain a kit for a cheaper price. PLA or PET are recommended as ABS will soften with resin contact. The kit does not require soldering, and can be fully assembled using metric allen keys and open ended wrenches.

We encourage you to download the software and make sure it runs on your computer before deciding to back the LIttleRP campaign.The LittleRP acts like a secondary monitor, with the Creation Workshop software managing what the projector displays as well as sending movement commands to the LittleRP. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( ABOVE:  Creation Workshop Layout View) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( ABOVE:  Creation Workshop Slicing Settings) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( ABOVE: Creation Workshop Slice View) Hollowing Software - There are a variety of free software packages you can use to hollow models and to add structures. While resin printers can handle much more extreme overhangs than FFF printers, supports are still required. Autodesk® Meshmixer® is a great general purpose model editing program that offers hollowing features.Hollowing your models has a number of benefits, firstly you will be able to print larger models if they are hollowed as it reduces the area of cured resin that comes in contact with the non-stick coating. Hollowed models will also extend your non-stick coating lifespan as solid models can create extra heat and impart more stress onto the coating. Small models such as jewelry typically do not require hollowing as the average surface area in a slice is already low. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( ABOVE: Hollowed models with holes to release uncured resin) Support Generating Software  - Adding extra support structures to a model before printing can be necessary. In cases where a part needs to be rotated in the x or y axis, elevated off of the build platform, or has extreme or negative overhangs supports may be needed for the part to print successfully. Creation Workshop, Autodesk® Meshmixer®, and B9Creator® Layout software are all excellent options that are free to use. Each generates different types of support structures, so becoming familiar with each is highly recommended.\"B9Creator\" is a registered trademark of B9Creations, LLC in the United States. B9Creator’s Software is open source, licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3. Projector Options   For the purposes of our kit, we recommend supporters choose either the Acer x1240, Acer P1283 or Acer P1500 projectors. The LittleRP is designed to be flexible with the projectors it supports, the three Acer options are simply choices we have verified to work with the design and have created mounting solutions for. When the campaign becomes successful we will make it a priority to offer additional projector recommendations and provide the necessary modification / mounting information for them. All prints shown have been printed on a 1024x768 projector 1) The Acer x1240 is an inexpensive (~$315+ USD) 1024x768 projector that will require user modification to work with the LittleRP. A modification guide and video will be available and consists of opening the projector to insert 3 spacers into the lens housing. It is also possible to use the Acer x1240 with external close-up filters if you are unable or unwilling to modify the projector internally. 2) The Acer P1283 is the replacement for the x1240 described above. Like the x1240 it can either be modified internally, or used with close-up filters. 3) The Acer P1500 is a more expensive (~$600+ USD) 1920x1080 option but one that requires no modifications to work with the LittleRP. At very close distances the P1500 does exhibit a sweet spot in the center of the projected image and may exhibit some softness towards the edges. 4) For the more technical of supporters the re-use of new and used DLP projectors is possible. Our first LittleRP utilized a $99 used Dell projector. We will provide basic instructions on what to look for in a DLP and how to adapt it to the LittleRP.  Print Quality Design choices have allowed the LittleRP to maintain a high print quality while maintaining a low cost. Finely detailed items such as jewelry can be printed on the LittleRP thanks to its rigid design and high quality linear motion components. As can be viewed in the close ups below a high degree of accuracy and detail can be achieved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (ABOVE: Tudor Rose by loubie / Thing:408189 [MadeSolid Resin]) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ABOVE: At 25 Micron layer height you can still read \"Make:\" on the back of the smallest robot) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nPrint Constraints   \n In the most basic configuration there are some printing constraints to consider. Because the basic version of the LittleRP does not use a method to peel the print from the vat surface you will need to be mindful of the volume your print requires. The basic version of the LittleRP is intended for jewelry, miniature figures and similar styles of prints. Larger models can be printed successfully by first hollowing and venting the STL files, guides on how to do this will be provided. Resin printers require trial and error as print failures will naturally occur. Like FFF printing, you may need to angle a part differently, add supports, or change curing time in order to achieve satisfactory print quality. Ultimately some models may not be printable due to a variety of factors. The non-stick vat surface has a limited lifespan but is replaceable. You can expect to achieve between 10-15 smaller sized prints in any one location on the vat before needing to replace the vat surface. By printing models on different parts of the vat, or hollowing your models you can increase this number.The non-stick coating we recommend is Sylgard 184 or comparable such as the MLSolar product shown below. To replace the vat surface you first simply peel up a corner of the damage surface and remote it completely. The surface is a cured silicone product and is very rubbery and easy to remove.Mix your Sylgard 184 according to direction then pour 10ml (approximately $1) into the empty vat lying on a level surface. The non-stick coating will set in as soon as 4 hours and will be fully cured in 48. We recommend having extra vats and non-stick coating on hand so that you can continue to print uninterrupted. Extra vats and non-stick coating will be available to add to your order when we collect your shipping costs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ( ABOVE: Removed damaged non-stick coating (left) , Vat with new non-stick coating (right)) Why Kickstarter Kickstarter allows LittleRP to accomplish several key goals: Volume Discounts - Although an important part of the LittleRP design is that it can be self-sourced in single quantities there are many benefits to volume purchasing. Volume purchasing will allow us to provide a more cost effective kit, as well as offer lower pricing on linear motion components to self-sourcers compared to what they could achieve sourcing on their own. Creation of a User Community - We have teamed up with buildyourownsla.com to provide a support forum for LittleRP users. By having an initial group of LittleRP users we can seed the forums and get a jump start on creating a prosperous resin printer community. The buildyourownsla.com forum also attracts many additional hobbyist and professionals. These users will provide another layer of support and resources for those looking at extending the capabilities of their LittleRP or other printer offerings.  Investments in Manufacturing Options - The successful Kickstarter campaign will allow us to make an investment in casting, lasercutting, and milling equipment. Having these technologies in house will allow us to test modifications and offer new features at a much faster rate. The LittleRP is the first step in a line of quality printers we hope to offer, having additional manufacturing options will substantially increase the speed we can make this happen.  Standalone Host - Currently most DLP based resin printers need to be attached to a personal computer while they are printing, the printer acting as a secondary monitor. With the success of the LittleRP Kickstarter we will actively pursue the development of a Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard or similar host. Such a host will be capable of controlling both the printer as well as the DLP projector freeing up your personal computer during printing. Once developed the standalone host will be available for anyone to use, not just LittleRP owners. Projector Testing - A barrier to DIY DLP resin printers is selecting an appropriate DLP projector. With the funds raised we can purchase additional projector models and test them for suitability with both the LittleRP as well as DIY DLP printers. Projectors found to be suitable will have mounting solutions documented and available for download. Resin Testing - There are a number new resins reaching the market with properties that make them suitable for casting, flexibility needs, and biocompatible applications. With a successful Kickstarter campaign we will have the ability to purchase additional resins for testing and provide configurations for their use with LittleRP. Future Upgradeability One goal of the Kickstarter campaign is to provide capital for testing modifications of the original design. We are currently in development of a tilting vat upgrade, and feel it offers a unique solution to peeling cured layers. In the video below you can see the rear of the vat and the build plate raise in unison. Both the vat and build plate travel can be controlled independently and by adjusting the ratio of the two you can move the fulcrum point of the peeling motion.A tilting vat allows you to print larger or more solid models and print them with a larger variety of resins.\n\nA tilting vat substantially reduces the limitations that are created by the sticking and suction forces common with bottom up resin printing. A tilting vat will not increase the available build area, rather allow you to fill more of the build area with cured resin. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n(ABOVE: LittleRP using Tilt Printing Solid Huntress Bust by Yan / Fantasygraph [MadeSolid Resin]) \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n(ABOVE: LittleRP using Tilt Timelapse - Doge Rocket by esprite / Thing:325098 [MakerJuice Resin]) \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n(ABOVE: LittleRP using Tilt Timelapse - California Condor Head [MakerJuice Resin]) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ABOVE: LittleRP using Tilt Print - Brian Bust by Michael Balzer of slo3dcreators.com [MadeSolid Resin]) The current state of LittleRP The LittleRP has already been produced in limited quantity for beta participants.

After Kickstarter Ends (Shipping / Projector / Resin) Before rewards ship we will contact you to obtain information needed to tailor your kit based on your preferences. During this time you will also be able to add additional vat, non-stick coating supplies, and additional resin to your order. We will ask which projector you intend to use and include a base plate and hardware specific to it.Shipping costs will also be finalized and collected as part of this procedure. We expect domestic unassembled projectorless kits to fit inside a USPS Priority Mail Large Flat-Rate box for a shipping cost of $20 (assembled and kits with a projector will incur additional shipping charges). The flat nature of the kit parts lends themselves well to efficient packing and we will make every effort to work with our international buyers to keep shipping costs low.

Uncured resin should not be allowed direct contact with skin as repeated exposure can cause skin sensitivity similar to a rash / allergic reaction. Once properly washed and cured, printed parts are mostly inert but should not be used where they will have prolonged skin or any food contact. It is important to have a non-porous or covered work surface dedicated for your resin printer as spills and splatters will and do occur. In addition protective eyewear and gloves should be used at all time when handling uncured resin. Partners LittleRP has made a strong effort to form and support domestic partnerships whenever possible, below are a list of companies that your Kickstarter reward will help support in addition to LittleRP: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals  100 Units - Metal build plate arm and mirror holder.We will make every attempt to include the stretch goals once reached but they are not guaranteed. Once a goal has been reached a new higher unit goal will be added.   Risks and challenges Risk associated with the LittleRP is low as development of the product has already completed and no special tooling is required.\n\nBecause we wanted to make the LittleRP as maker friendly as possible there is a reliance on FFF printed parts in the design. Depending on the success of the Kickstarter providing these in high enough volume may prove challenging. Our initial plan is to scale our existing print farm to meet this demand. If Kickstarter demand becomes something that is not feasable to meet with our FFF printers we will switch certain printed parts (Arm / Mirror Holder) to folded metal sheet. The metal parts will be backwards compatible with the FFF printed parts, but allow us to scale the kit to larger quantities more rapidly. We already have the sheet metal parts designed and have received manufacturing quotes.\n\nWith any project there may be unforeseen difficulties and delays. In such a case we ask that you be patient while will make every effort to minimize potential impact. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story 5 Must Knows About A Film Called \"mooo\" 1. What is \"mooo\"?  \"mooo\" is a short film about a douchebag film director, his vapid girlfriend, and a flaming comedy of errors that ensnares them with two down-to-earth friends.  When level-headedness rises to squelch phoniness, it explodes like water on a grease fire! 2. Why does independent film (indiefilm) matter?  Fresh new shows that surprise and entertain don't sprout from nowhere and land on HBO. They get invented by writers, filmmakers, and actors harvesting a new wave of creativity. Indiefilm is where edgy stories get tested with new ways to tell them. It's where the chemistry of great new shows gets formulated.\n 3. How will your donation change lives?  In the 80's & 90's\nSeattle was Hollywood North.  But today, money for video flows to Los Angeles producers.  That's rough on Seattle indie filmmakers, who survive by doing side work\nin advertising and corporate video (source: Office of Film & Music ).   Seattle\nhas the talent, but not enough to meet demand.  Funding indiefilms helps Seattle showcase its\ncreativity, invites talent to come flourish in its vibrant indiefilm scene, helps Seattle meet the demands of advertisers, and provides more side work for Seattle's writers, actors, & filmmakers.  Your donation is a hand-up, not a handout, for 20+ creative people who will make \"mooo\".  4. Who are we?  We are Speetzfire, a collaboration of independent film (indiefilm) makers based in Seattle. We're part of the extraordinarily vibrant northwest indiefilm community; one that promises to redefine entertainment just like grunge and Macklemore redefined music.  5. Why donate now? We plan to submit \"mooo\" to the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) about 3 months from now! In the world of filmmaking, that's not much time.  Your donation will greatly improve our chances of getting accepted to SIFF in two ways.  It'll fuel the passion of our cast & crew knowing an audience cares.  And it'll give us the financial freedom to improve the overall quality of the film -- the look, the sound, and the experience of watching it.  So please donate now :) \n\n\n\n\nSome of the cast & crew of \"mooo\", a production of Speetzfire \n \n\n \n\nWhat makes us tick?  For those of you who don't know us, we're a team of independent filmmakers who think it'd be a better world if people did what they loved.   \nWhat have we done? Members of our team have been involved in over 10 independent films, in the past year alone, with one including Hollywood notables and another in the (SIFF) Seattle International Film Festival. These are some of our latest titles from our collaboration: \n\n\nSpeetzfire's filmography \n \n\n \n\n Tell me more about the \"mooo\" story.   Dino's an obnoxious and overbearing film director.  His girlfriend Gina stays with him simply because he promised her a role in his TV commercial.   But things fall apart when Gina realizes her star role is just a one liner.   Two clear-headed friends, Renee and Phillip, see the phoniness.   But their efforts accelerate hilarious confusion and a comedy of errors. What's our distribution plan?   Our first priority is to submit to SIFF (Seattle International Film Festival) and STIFF (Seattle True Independent Film Festival).   We will also hold small venue screenings in Seattle.  We will distribute our film to other festivals and/or online based on audience response and response from judges. Why don't you get a DVD for donating?  Our agreement with the actors union (SAG-AFTRA) limits our distribution.   If we distribute our film outside of film festivals, then we must pay actors full rate.   Our stretch funding goals (explained in the open letter from \"mooo\"'s creator) allow us to fund both the actors and the DVDs. What's the wrap video?  After completion, we will create an entirely separate, fun video to celebrate completion of our project and give a shout-out to key contributors.\"mooo\" isn't icky like Seth MacFarlane. We were afraid a film about milk and breasts would be a cesspool of adolescent male humor. So we evened the score when we created the rewards for large donors!  (just a little surprise from the producer to the director!)

Pre-production, production, and post-production.\n\nThe first risk is, getting through pre-production. This entails securing cast, crew, & location within budget. We're pretty much past that hurdle now. Having made films for virtually no budget, we're good at begging people to commit to us. But we want to make it worth their time, and that's what this Kickstarter is about.\n\nThe primary risk of production is completing all the shots on time. That comes down to planning and good risk management. Planning shots helps us prioritize. Risk management means simplifying shots on-the-fly in order to meet deadlines (i.e. that an actor has limited availability, or a location has a set time schedule, etc.). As a team, we have been involved in several very short time-frame projects, sometimes as little as 7.5 hours. So we're very practiced at planning, scheduling, and risk management.\n\nThe primary risk of post-production is lost footage and missing shots. These risks are actually production risks, but surprisingly many filmmakers experience these problems in post-production because of poor planning. In our case, we've made a lot of these mistakes before, and in response we developed a process to minimize those errors. With that solved, the primary risk in post-production is time, that it takes longer to edit than the budget allows. And in our case we have several editors on our crew that can pitch-in and see this through to completion.\n\nFinally, a film is a project that has to be managed. And it takes a leader who can accept responsibility for mistakes, pocket the errors, and has the passion to drive things forward. And we're fortunate our Director & Executive Producer, Kevin Owyang brings all that.\n\nSo does being \"Stoopid-Fast Feelmakers\" mean we're sloppy and haphazard? Not at all. We think of it as taking our time to do a good job, at a super rapid pace. And we pour our hearts, souls, and every ounce of feeling into every film we make.\n\nAnd just like anyone who is stupid with love, our projects are alive, their world seems new, and life seems more worth living. We invite you to be a part. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Word on the Street: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Duo? And why? Once nearly ubiquitous, TLRs have been reduced to a tool used only by a small niche of photographers. This unique form factor provides a huge, brilliant waist-level viewfinder, no shutter blackout, and a quiet shutter. Most TLRs have been dedicated to medium-format and 35mm film. But what about Polaroids, that deliciously quirky instant film? Few production cameras were ever made that could shoot instant film, and almost certainly none were designed for it specifically. \n\n\nDuo's spiritual ancestors. \n \n\n \n\n\nDuo was designed to combine the timeless appeal of of instant film with the very special experience of using a twin-lens-reflex camera. It began as an idea in the realm of daydreams and sketches, eventually becoming two fully functional cameras built from laser-cut wooden parts. As it happens, its design happens to lend itself perfectly to easy construction as a kit. Duo is a unique camera that any patient photographer can build on a kitchen table.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy goal is to put Duo in the hands of the public, as a kit . These kits would contain all of the parts needed to construct the camera, including the laser-cut birch plywood parts, mirror, ground glass, and assorted hardware. All you need to do is provide a lens and a Polaroid back or roll film back of your choice.   Duo's core values Simplicity \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn today's age of buttons, control dials, and zillions of megapixels, we are reminded that a good camera must be easy to use. Moreover, a camera that you make yourself must also be a snap to construct. Duo's simple, no-nonsense design makes it a pleasure to use and build. Utility \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA camera is a tool - Duo's purpose is to create images, not sit in a trophy case. It was designed with field work in mind - a huge viewfinder, fast lenses, lightweight construction, and interchangeable backs make it a camera that you'll want to take everywhere. Huge 97x97mm waist-level viewfinder, with laser-etched framelines \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightweight, robust birch plywood construction (under 3 pounds) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterchangeable Polaroid and roll film backs (with optional adapter): \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeauty \n\n\nClick for more photos taken with Duo. \n \n\n \n\n \nDuo allows photographers to create Polaroid images like never before. Mamiya-Sekor optics (40mm equivalent) fill the entire 3.25\" x 4.25\" frame, and are fast enough to create luscious bokeh.  Responsibility All major components (laser parts, mirror, ground glass, hardware) are made in or otherwise sourced from companies in the United States. At a Glance: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere we are now: Rough sketches of the camera were made beginning in July 2012. Since then, the entire camera has been modeled in SolidWorks, which produces the templates for laser-cutting the wooden parts. This CAD model is constantly evolving to reflect changes in the design.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first prototype was completed in October 2012. An extensive amount of testing was performed with this camera, lessons from which were incorporated in a second prototype, completed in January 2013.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter? Although successful, these cameras were just a proof-of-concept of Duo's design. Changes to the design and construction of additional prototypes will be necessary to ensure that the camera can be easily constructed with minimal frustration and only the most basic hand tools. Manufacturing techniques such as CNC routing and laser engraving are being explored to deliver the most \"complete\" kit possible.  Funds raised through Kickstarter will help to finance additional prototypes that will act as testbeds for new features and to generally improve the user experience. Feedback from fellow photographers has already been incorporated in the two existing cameras - additional iterations will help ensure that the finished product is of the highest quality possible. One-off cameras are quite expensive. To make Duo available at a reasonable cost, minimum quantity requirements must be met to decrease the cost of the camera's constituent parts. Finding backers for this project is a sure-fire way to ensure that the product can be put into the public's hands at a reasonable price. Rewards! $9: POLAROID PRINT: A photo of one of the prototype cameras, shot on Fujifilm FP100C, with a note of appreciation on the back. US shipping only. $209: BASIC DUO KIT: Just about everything needed to build Duo. Just add the lenses and Polaroid back.  \n+$48 International Shipping \n+$20 Roll film adapter \n $299: DELUXE DUO KIT (Limited 10) : Nearly everything needed to build Duo, and more! Includes the Roll film adapter, stainless steel focusing knob. You may also personalize your camera with custom engravings of your choice on the viewfinder hood, and on the base of the camera! +$48 International Shipping $649: READY-TO-USE DUO (Limited 2) : One Duo camera, ready to use straight out of the box. You must send the lens and Polaroid back to be fitted to the camera. US shipping only. Kit Information Contents The kits will contain all of the necessary parts to build Duo, minus the lens and Polaroid back (see section below) . This includes: \nLaser cut birch plywood parts \nGround glass and acrylic cover with frosted framelines \nFront surface mirror \nMaterial for bellows and viewfinder shade \nAssorted hardware (nuts, screws, gears, wire, etc) \nTwo (2) adapters for Polaroid backs \n Just add a lens and Polaroid back Lenses: You must supply a 105mm f/3.5 Mamiya-Sekor lens pair. These lenses were originally used in Mamiya C-series TLRs.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy removing a few screws and rings, the lens pair is easily and reversibly separated. These lenses are plentiful on the used market. More information on selecting a lens. Backs and Media:  You must also supply a Mamiya Press Polaroid Back or  Polaroid 600SE Back . Minor, reversible modification is required to for use on Duo. With this back, you can use any Type 100 peel-apart film (e.g. Fujifilm FP-100C, FP-3000B). More information on Polaroid backs. \nWith the optional Roll Film Adapter , you can use any Graflex-type 120 or 220 film back. Many of these 6x6, 6x7, and 6x9 backs were made by the likes of Graflex, Horseman, Wista, Mamiya, and more. More information on Roll Film Backs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, so how do I build this thing? The kit will be accompanied by detailed, step-by-step online instructions. The build process can be broken down into four basic parts: 1. Construct the frame: The wooden frame is glued together with help from a tab-and-slot design and laser engraved guidelines.  \n\n2. Fold the bellows and viewfinder shade: The bellows and viewfinder shade are cut and folded to shape from fabric and paper. The patterns for both parts and all required materials (minus adhesive) are included. 3. Finish it as you see fit: Acrylic, polyurethane, stain, plain-ol' bare wood finish - the sky is the limit. All you really  need is some flat black paint to coat the insides. 4. Add your components:  Add the lenses and film back of your choice, and you're ready to enjoy shooting with Duo! The Official Duo Companion Blog  exists solely to help backers understand the build process and its various intricacies. It contains helpful information for selecting a lens and a Polaroid back - check it out! \n\n\n Risks and challenges AVAILABILITY OF LENSES AND POLAROID BACKS: At the moment, the camera is limited in the types of lenses and Polaroid backs that can be used. Since the backer is responsible for supplying both of these items to complete a camera, the ensuing demand for these items could result in artificial inflation and increased scarcity of these 20-40 year old parts. The plan is to diversify the lens and back selection for the camera. Four variants of Mamiya 105mm lenses exist, and testing will be conducted to ensure that each of these lenses are viable options. Development of a 6x9 back attachment or an adapter for the upcoming Impossible FPU represent ways to ease demand on the relatively scarce Polaroid backs.\n\nFILM IS DEAD??? (Or so they say): Production of instant film by Fujifilm will likely continue into the forseeable future. However, eventually the medium may be discontinued and stocks of the film will disappear. Diversifying the media choices by adding adapters and attachments will keep this camera usable well into the future. Creating additional demand for instant film may keep Fujifilm from discontinuing the media altogether - this seems to be the best and only way to prevent this eventuality.\n\nWHAT IF THE CAMERA IS TOO HARD TO BUILD? Efforts are being made in the prototyping stages to ensure ease of construction and improve build quality. Slotted and keyed slots and laser engraved markings will help simplify positioning of camera elements. An illustrated guide and videos will detail the entire process of building, operating, and troubleshooting the camera. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story 1862: Railway mania in the Eastern Counties\n \nA railway investment game in the “18xx” series, for 2 to 8 players. \n\n\nBoard \n \n\n \n\nAfter some 8 years in development, Prune Enterprises and LMN+B  Games \nare proud to present Mike Hutton’s second game in the “18xx” series of \nrailway games. Players form and invest in railway companies, and try to \nrun their railways for a profit. Mike Hutton’s previous game, \n“1860: Railways on the Isle of Wight”, introduced in 2004, was listed \namong the top 100 games at Essen that year, and has attracted many \nfavourable reviews for its distinctive and innovative approach to the \ngenre. \n\n\ncompanies available \n \n\n \n\nThis new game follows the familiar pattern of share buying and \nrunning railway companies, common to other games in the “18xx” series. \nThe game introduces a number of innovations which give “1862: Railway \nmania in the Eastern Counties” a unique feel and strategic outlook. Far \nfrom being evolution of its predecessor, this game has been designed \nfrom scratch, and although some elements will remind players of aspects \nfound in “1860”, it is a very different game in a number of respects. \n\n\n\nTown development \n \n\n \n\nThe game contains three different types of train, each with very \ndifferent strengths and weaknesses. In addition to this the game \nincludes 20 railway companies, 16 of which are chosen at random at the \nstart of the game. This, with the random allocation of railway permits, \nallows for an almost limitless number of permutations and almost \nguarantees that no two games will ever be the same, even before the game\n starts. \n\n\n\nCharter \n \n\n \n\nMany “18xx” games give a strong advantage to more experienced players\n as they will be aware of which companies are stronger than others. This\n is not the case with “1862..”; the random setup ensures that the \ncompanies’ relative strengths and weaknesses change from game to game. This\n diversity has meant that the game has needed to be extensively tested \nby a number of groups over a considerable period of time. The game is \nnow fully developed and ready for publication. It has received even more\n positive feedback during this period than that for “1860...”. \n\n\ntown development \n \n\n \n\nSo what do you get with the game? Each game comes boxed, and complete with the\nfollowing: ·Game board (map) showing East Anglia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n·Fully illustrated rules ·34 double-sided Train cards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n·Train permit cards, for using Freight, Local, and Express trains. ·8 Phase change cards, lettered A to H. ·160 share certificates ·200 company tokens, with stickers for each token ·Approx 20 Small station tokens ·175 Hexagonal track tiles in yellow / green / russet \n\n\n\n\n\n\n·4 white counters to mark unused companies ·Round marker and player order cards ·Money (£15,000) and the all-important Priority\ndeal card The artwork is functional and aesthetically rich – company charters \ndisplay actual railway stations and landmarks, and other artwork harks \nback to the newspapers of the 1840s. The rulebook includes options for \nsimpler and shorter games. Numerous player aids and rules reminders are included on the board and components to allow players to play fluidly and quickly.\n A word about the designer Mike Hutton is a long-standing hobby board-gamer and designer. He\n is the designer of “1860 – Railways on the Isle of Wight”, and has \nwritten reviews for Counter Magazine over a number of years.\n Risks and challenges As with any project that involves the production and manufacture of goods to be delivered, there is are always a chance for set backs, delays and production issues.\nHowever we have a wealth of experience to fall back on from previous projects under the LMN+B and Prune game labels.\nWe try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.We will keep backers up to date with progress of the project, good and bad. We will hold ourselves to the same high standards that are expected from from other board game publishers. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

BUT - writing, producing and recording an album is not an easy (or inexpensive) thing to do! It takes drive, determination, talent and money... The latter is what I need from YOU to make it happen.  $6,000 is the bare minimum I need. This will cover the studio rental, my recording engineer, my mixing/mastering engineers, and my hired musicians. Everything else I'll need to pay out of pocket UNLESS I can raise more - which is my goal. That will not only help me pay for other expenses (travel, food, per diems for musicians, publishing, etc) but could ALSO enable me to get a music video, new website, new photos, in ear monitors, money for touring - the sky is the limit! Being an independent artist is expensive! :) **This awesome video was done by Jonathan Thorpe!! www.jthorpephoto.com** To see a list of my upcoming shows, please go to: www.juliafanningmusic.com/shows Risks and challenges There are definitely risks with recording an album. I am relying on a team to get this done - and there's always the risk of someone getting sick, needing to push back recording time, etc. However, I've selected the best of the best - the most professional artists and collaborators and feel very confident that his project will get done on time!

    "descriptionMediaNumber": 24,
    "textLength": 20225,
    "textDescription": "Story Note: You can now  support Sprite Lamp via PayPal! \nOther note: I've added proper stretch goals further down the project! \nThird note: Sprite Lamp has been greenlit, and will therefore be available on Steam when the time comes! In a time when even phones have considerable graphical power under the hood, why do so many developers continue to make games with a visual style based around traditional 2D art styles, such as pixel art? Clearly, it's because people love how it looks.  \n\n\nSo why did we spend all this time coming up with pixel shaders and lighting algorithms? Because they're pretty awesome too, of course. \nUnfortunately, you kind of have to choose between these two great things. Having a game that looks like Metal Slug or Bastion, but also allows full dynamic lighting of the scene as the sun sets or as explosions go off around the player, has generally fallen somewhere between 'impossible' and 'kind of possible but really annoying to set up'.  \nSprite Lamp brings this within reach.  \nSay you're making a zombie game, and you like pixel art, but you'd also like the main character to light their way with a flaming torch, because atmosphere is cool. With Sprite Lamp, you could create a dynamically lightable zombie, without touching any 3D modelling software, and maintain the style of pixel art — something like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its core, Sprite Lamp is a tool for generating assets — primary among them, a normal map. Most game engines, and virtually all 3D game engines these days, support lighting with normal maps; this isn't anything new. The trick is the way the normal maps are generated.  \nTraditionally, normal maps have been generated in one of two ways. You can render out a normal map based on a 3D model — so, if you want a normal map for a brick wall, you fire up a 3D modelling tool of your choice, build the brick wall, and then render out a normal map. Alternatively, you can take a photo of a brick wall, and pass it through an analysis tool (such as CrazyBump) to generate a normal map. \nI'm not planning for Sprite Lamp to displace these tools or methods — sometimes they are just what you need — but they have downsides. Making a mesh of an object is time-consuming, often involves expensive software, and isn't something every artist knows how to do. It can also be difficult to preserve artistic style such as brushstroke placement. Analysing photos or other images can be great, and is much quicker, but the results aren't always physically accurate unless you create it from a depth map, which is almost as difficult to create from scratch as a normal map anyway. \nMy goal with Sprite Lamp is to offer a third option, for when quality or style is a high priority, but 3D modelling isn't a good option. \nSprite Lamp requires the artist to draw several images. For the zombie above, five images were used. First, the artist draws an outline of the zombie, and colours it without any shading. This is called the diffuse map, and it looks like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprite Lamp currently creates normal maps, depth maps, ambient occlusion maps, and anisotropy maps. The first three all stem from what I call 'lighting profiles'. These are created by imagining that the subject of your picture is made out of white plaster, and then drawing them with lights shining on them from different angles. For this zombie example, four lighting profiles were used. They look like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! Sprite lamp processes those images into a normal map (as well as a depth map and an ambient occlusion map, if you so desire). The created images look like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then import these into your game engine and use them as you see fit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprite Lamp works well for pixel art, but that's not all it's for. It's entirely possible to use digital painting with Sprite Lamp to obtain a hand-drawn look. In fact, the first test we ever ran on Sprite Lamp was with a hastily scribbled picture of a goat. Here we've used four lighting profiles. \nNote that in general, Sprite Lamp can make do with as few as two lighting profiles, and can make use of as many as five. The more you have, the rougher they can be and still get you good results. We've found that three or four profiles usually works best. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese images, combined with a very simple diffuse map, yields these results: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, if you feel so inclined, you can use Sprite Lamp to process physical media. We tested this out here using a ball point pen and a light box: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on a survey conducted with early backers, Sprite Lamp now has official stretch goals. Note that regardless of stretch goal status, my hope is to release Sprite Lamp in the second quarter of 2014. However, depending on how this goes, some of the stretch goal features might come out in an update after launch. \nPalette system, and expanded engine support (reached!): The palette system will be a combination of image processing and shaders, and it will allow artists to directly control the colours that get rendered for a given image. For instance, this allows the artist to set the colour of shaded areas versus highlights. Expanded engine support will involve me writing shaders for several engines beyond Unity. Currently the frontrunners for this treatment are Construct 2, Game Maker, and libgdx.\n \nExpanded depth map options (reached!): At this level, I'll add the ability to tweak the depth map from within Sprite Lamp using various intelligent tools. I'm also going to make it possible to export a mesh of the depth map, which will be useful under certain situations when parallax is required but pixel shaders aren't a good solution.\n \nSkelmesh functionality (reached!): According to the survey, the majority of Sprite Lamp backers so far who are looking for skelmesh functionality are Spine users. At this level, I will add the ability to view Spine animations in Sprite Lamp's preview window, as well as release examples of integration between Sprite Lamp and at least one of Spine's runtimes.\n \nStreamlined interface: Regardless of stretch goals, I'm going to be putting some time towards smoothing the rough edges of Sprite Lamp's interface. However, at this level I'll be able to put some major code work towards the task of making it more usable, such as enabling live updates in the preview window as input files are changed, writing my own (more appropriate) colour picker, and allowing the user to save and load sets of options (such as lighting and shader conditions). \nBeyond: I really haven't had the chance to think much about this, and I'm not in a position to name a funding goal. However, given more time, I would love to look into realtime algorithms for improving the visual quality of illuminated pixel art, by identifying and 'fixing' bad clusters. I have a few similar ideas for approaching making painted images look better, too. Of course, on a more mundane level, more time will allow me to expand the number of engines with shader integration.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most common questions people ask about Sprite Lamp is, \"Does it work with the engine I'm using?\" The answer is that Sprite Lamp simply creates assets, and you can put them to any use you want. Most game engines with a lighting system — such as Unity, Unreal, and CryEngine — are good to go. If you're using an engine specifically for 2D, and maybe a bit more lo-fi, you should check if it supports normal mapping, or failing that, custom shaders. \nThere are some shader techniques you can use to help achieve whatever 2D art style you're going for. The zombie example (above) is made using a simple cel-shading shader. The plague doctor example (the fellow with the funny mask and the cane, above) makes significant use of self-shadowing, which in this case uses the depth map created by Sprite Lamp. This option probably isn't included as a built-in shader in most game engines. \nFor that reason, even though it's not technically part of Sprite Lamp, I'm going to do my best to provide free custom shaders for some common engines (such as Unity) that will help you get the most out of what you make with Sprite Lamp. Stuff like per-texel lighting, self-shadowing, and palette lookups aren't super-advanced features, but they're daunting if you don't write shaders. They are also unlikely to be included in most engines — because the assets they look best with are usually so hard to create. I'll only be able to provide actual shaders for common engines like Unity, but I'll also write some tutorials to describe exactly how it all works, so if your game engine supports customisable shaders, you'll be able to get things looking good. \nThis stuff isn't really part of the Kickstarter; it's not a reward level, because I'm just going to make these shaders and tutorials freely available. Hopefully this will help people be more productive with Sprite Lamp. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome ambitious folk might be reading this and thinking, \"Could I use this to make a game in the spirit of Metal Slug or Link to the Past, but with full dynamic lighting?\" And just to be clear, the answer is absolutely YES. If you do it, you should tell me so I can play your game. \nHowever, you might also be thinking, \"That sounds like way too much work, so Sprite Lamp is not for me.\" Fair enough — it might not be — but before you go, I'll mention that there are a couple of other applications for this technology that don't involve overhauling your whole art pipeline. \nReducing the need for varied assets: One of the things you have to do as an artist is make sure that repeating artwork isn't too obvious. For instance, tiling textures need to be large enough that there isn't an eye-catching and undesirable pattern. Likewise, variations have to be drawn onto individual sprites if they are to be part of a horde, to avoid the horde looking too samey. As an example, here is a 64x64 tiled texture: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is that same texture, at the same resolution and tiled the same amount of times, with a single point light to provide some variation: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think it's fair to say that most people would notice the tiling in the first image fairly easily; while I wouldn't go so far as to say it's horrible or anything, an artist might be inclined to draw at a higher resolution to get some nicer variation. However, it's harder to notice that the second image features a tiling texture at all. \nRelighting characters for different environments: Sometimes it can be a challenge to have a single character travel to different levels in a game, because the character has to fit multiple colour schemes. If you were to make that character's assets with Sprite Lamp, you could intelligently recolour them for lots of different environments without having to rework any art. This can even be done completely as a pre-processing step — no need to have any dynamic lighting in your game engine at all. More importantly, this means that you only have to do the lighting profiles for your main character; all the environmental art, enemies that belong to specific levels of your game, etc. can all be done the traditional way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlain old normal maps for your 3D game: This might seem like an obvious one, but I think it's worth mentioning. Since Sprite Lamp produces fairly standard assets, they are just as usable in a 3D engine as any other normal map. The same goes for the depth and ambient occlusion maps, and perhaps most importantly, the anisotropy maps, too. If enough people ask for it, I'll even implement the ability to load up a 3D model in the Sprite Lamp preview window. It might seem a little confusing, but the way you paint lighting profiles for a UV-unwrap works in the least counterintuitive way possible, and isn't much harder to get your head around than most UV-unwrap texture painting. \nCreating stereograms from 2D art: This is the reason I've included an Oculus Rift in my budget. I haven't explored this fully yet, because I don't have the right hardware — but because Sprite Lamp generates depth maps, it should be possible to offset pixels in such a way that a stereogram is created. This would allow for an Oculus Rift-friendly 2D game. Here's a sample of a hand-drawn stereogram we made as an experiment: \n\n\n\nYou have to cross your eyes for this one. \n \n\n \n\nBetter-looking rotation of sprites:  You know that thing where a lovely hand-painted 2D platformer will have the occasional physical object — a rock, or a crate or something — that bounces around and rotates? I find that those objects tend to look somewhat out of place compared to the rest of the game. This is because when you draw an object normally, it has 'baked in' lighting of some kind. For a normal 2D game, you'd probably avoid painting in shadows and the like because it will look wrong when the object rotates. However, there is still some implicit lighting, usually in the form of more light coming from above than below (the kind of lighting you get on a bright but cloudy day outside). When the object rolls, it looks wrong; it's very hard to paint completely omni-directional generic lighting into a picture. Having a hand-drawn normal map makes it straightforward to make the object fit with the rest of the world at every orientation. \n2D skeletal mesh animation: By the same token, Sprite Lamp is a natural fit for 2D skeletal mesh animation. It's currently a bit awkward to paint shading into the components of a 2D skelmesh character, because when they rotate relative to each other, the shading becomes inconsistent. Having a normal map fixes that. (I should note that while it is absolutely possible to have normal mapping and skeletal mesh animation work in harmony, I haven't had the time to do this yet.) \nAnisotropy maps: The Pro version of Sprite Lamp allows you to convert a hand drawn 'flow map' into an anisotropy map. Anisotropic specular highlights occur on materials that have microfacets aligned in the same direction, such as hair or brushed metal. Though shaders that render anisotropy have existed for some time, the maps used to indicate microfacet direction are quite difficult and inconvenient to author, and this is particularly so for hand-drawn art. As such, I've developed a way to process an image that contains the direction of microfacets and convert it into an anisotropy map.  \nTo illustrate this point, I have developed an unrealistically shiny elephant. The artist draws a flow map, which looks something like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe white lines indicate the direction of microfacets on the elephant. This map is processed by Sprite Lamp to create an anisotropy map. When this is combined with an appropriate shader (as well as a diffuse map and a normal map) the result looks like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI expect that a significant number of users will make use of this feature for 3D modelling, rather than 2D artwork. With that in mind, I intend to find out what standard forms anisotropy maps take and export to those standards, so that artists can work easily with the out-of-the-box anisotropy shaders found in common 3D modelling programs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is traditional with software tools like this, I'm going to make a few versions of Sprite Lamp available: a free version, that you can play around with but not export the maps you create (so you can't use it for making games), a hobbyist version that is similar except with the ability to export, and a pro version with more features, such as the ability to use custom shaders in the preview window. When Sprite Lamp is finished, the non-Kickstarter price for the hobbyist version will be $40, and for the pro version will be $100. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart leaves out a few potential features that may appear if I exceed my goal, or pending the results of some experimentation that hasn't yet succeeded to my satisfaction. Probably the most important of these is the ability to edit depth maps in a useful fashion from within Sprite Lamp. I'd very much like to add this, because there are certain circumstances where the 'correct' depth map would have discontinuities that are impossible to derive from a normal map alone. Ideally, those cases should be possible to handle with human intervention. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Sprite Lamp is in development on my PC, which means the things you've seen here are from the Windows version. I fully intend to release Sprite Lamp for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. In fact, one of the major reasons for bringing the project to Kickstarter is so I can afford to buy a mac. I do currently have intermittent access to a Mac for some basic proof-of-concept work, however.  \nMy goal is to have a basic functional version of MacOS and Linux by shortly after the end of the kickstarter. This means that although pledging to receive beta access will be a slightly better deal for Windows users, users of other operating systems will at least get something worthwhile and usable (at least the ability to create and preview normal maps). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, as you can see, Sprite Lamp is currently unpolished but development is very much underway. So, why am I on Kickstarter at all? There are a couple of reasons. \nMy costs of living are pretty low out here, and so to some extent I can work on a project like Sprite Lamp self-funded without too many problems. However, I need to make the thing releasable. This means: \n\nMaking versions of Sprite Lamp for MacOS and Linux. \nMaking sure Sprite Lamp runs on a variety of hardware and OS configurations. \nMaking sure Sprite Lamp works smoothly with major engines such as Unity. \nDeveloping a more professional and usable UI design. \nTesting stereoscopic images with an Oculus Rift. \n \nSome of that just costs time, but some of it costs money as well. Some of Sprite Lamp's budget will go toward my cost of living so that I can devote more time to it, but mostly it will go toward buying hardware that I don't have (such as a Mac) and licensing software that I need (such as Unity Pro). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Giselle Rosman for help and support with the project so far, particularly for advice and sanity-checks on public release of information. \nThanks to Erica Sharpe for helping me come up with the name 'Sprite Lamp', which was a considerable step up from its previous name, 'the goat tech'. \nThanks to Jason O'Callaghan for helping me out with camera/lighting hardware and expertise for the video. Any questionable editing that happened after filming is my fault alone. \nThanks to Jonathan Blow, Tom Francis, and Robot Loves Kitty for giving me permission to use their games (Braid , Gunpoint , and Legend of Dungeon ) as examples as examples of excellent painted art, pixel art, and illuminated sprites, even though I ended up only using them in this section here. \nThanks to Esoteric Software for consulting with me about what's involved with their excellent 2D skelmesh animation system, Spine, and for letting me use a lit version of Spineboy in my video. \n \n Risks and challenges As you can see, Sprite Lamp is past the proof-of-concept stage. I'm not asking for any faith in the idea that the algorithms behind Sprite Lamp work, because they already do. This Kickstarter is to help me polish up the final product, get it ported to platforms besides Windows, and make sure that everything works smoothly in the most likely use cases (such as common engines like Unity).\n\nThere are some risks in terms of the project taking longer than I expect. These come in the form of my not being an experienced MacOS or Linux developer. However, these aren't terminal risks to the project. I think the algorithms behind Sprite Lamp are pretty cool, but the software itself isn't exactly a staggering engineering project. Even if I was forced by unexpected incompatibilities to rewrite the whole project for each different OS, all it would do is delay the release for a few months.\n\nThere is also the possibility that I'll get hit by a bus, or perhaps something less dramatic but similarly project-ending. If that happens and the project is cancelled, I intend to release the source code for the project, so backers will still get at least part of what they signed up for.

    "textDescription": "Story NEWS FLASH: We Won! Out of more than 2500 exhibitors the BBQ Dragon won the BEST NEW GRILL ACCESSORY of the National Hardware Show in Las Vegas. Great work, keep buying and spreading the word. The BBQ Dragon is THE grill tool you need! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE #1:Great news - our factory says that they can start shipping BBQ Dragons by mid-June! So pledge now and know that we should be able to start shipping BBQ Dragons by mid-June regardless of the dates shown on the individual rewards! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The BBQ Dragon turns a smoldering pile of charcoal into a hellfire of meat-searing glory in under 10 minutes\" - Urbandaddy.com \"BBQ Dragons can heat charcoal to grilling temps in only 10 minutes and improve the performance of a variety of cooking gear\" - Dude! I want that... \"Summer is right around the corner and everyone is getting the cobwebs off of the barbecue. The BBQ Dragon is a grill accessory on Kickstarter that lets you easily start a fire whether you want to turn on the grill or simply start a fire on the beach. If you want to be a grill master this summer, you will need one of these on Kickstarter .\" - The Crowdfund Mafia What is the BBQ Dragon?   The BBQ Dragon is a fire-starting tool that starts charcoal faster than a chimney without using lighter fluid, controls the heat of grills and smokers, revives smoldering fires, and scares cats off of counters. It works by blowing large amounts of low-velocity, cool air at fires, providing them with more oxygen so they burn hotter and faster. It's cordless, hands-free and portable so you can use it tailgating and camping or at the beach. It works for grills, smokers, fire pits, fireplaces, wood stoves, and more.  Watch the BBQ Dragon start a grill in 10 minutes: \nCharcoal vs. Gas: Everyone agrees that charcoal cooks better; is hotter, imparts better flavor to food, and is more ecologically sustainable than gas. Plus who doesn't love the smell of a charcoal grill on the 4th of July? But, up until now, it's been less convenient to use than gas because it's hard to start and takes a long time. But the BBQ Dragon has changed that. Now, instead of waiting 45 minutes, your grill will be ready in 10 minutes - half the time of a charcoal chimney. It will be hotter than a gas grill, the food will taste better and you don't need lighter fluid. Who wouldn't use charcoal now?  \"Gas grills are for amateurs.\" - Empowernetwork.com \nWhat people are saying: \n“This BBQ Dragon, I'm telling you, it's going to every tailgate with me. You're going to want this item – BBQ Dragon.” - Jeff (Doc) Dockeray, Tailgate Media Network          \n“I n competition I want that heat and I want it fast. BBQ Dragon - love it.” - Steve Adams, Three-time Canadian barbecue champion. \n \n\n\n\n“Incredible! Stick it on anything, recharge it – pretty cool little device. I'm going to have one in my home.” - Dave, Rustic Natural Cedar Furniture                      “The BBQ Dragon is working...very, very good! We like it.” - John Henry, John Henry's Food Products                                                                      How does it work? The BBQ Dragon works by providing a large amount of oxygen to a fire. The reason people wave paper plates at fires, and blow on them, is to provide extra oxygen to speed them up. The BBQ Dragon does this for you. Just clip the Dragon on the side of your grill, aim it at the fire and turn it on.  You'll see the coals immediately begin glowing and burning much more intensely. And since it's hands-free, you don't need to stand around the hot fire until it's ready for cooking. The BBQ Dragon has a variable speed controller, so you can adopt the air volume perfectly to any situation: High volumes of air for a bonfire or outdoor fire pit, medium levels for fireplaces and wood stoves, and low levels for smokers and smaller fires. \n\n\nLights fire pits, fireplaces, and campfires \n \n\n \n\nThe BBQ Dragon is battery powered so you can take it anywhere and never have to fuss with extension cords or plugs. The AA batteries are both rechargeable, using a standard micro-USB charger which you probably already have, or replaceable, in case you forget to charge it and need to start a fire. \n\n\nMicro-USB recharging \n \n\n \n\nThe micro-USB port will allow us to make future versions of the BBQ Dragon user-programmable. What will you be able program? Maybe you want to set a timer so the Dragon beeps after 10 minutes, or maybe you want to program it to always start at full volume and then gradually reduce its speed as your fire starts. We think there are many exciting things you will be able to program the Dragon to do, and can't wait to find out how you program yours.  \n\n\n\nCrazy power and heat for your grill \n \n\n \n\nWhere can I use it? You can use the BBQ Dragon anywhere you want to light a fire. It clips to any type of charcoal grill, but that's just the beginning. Ceramic cookers like the Big Green Egg, or the Primo Grill are some of the most popular new ways to grill, and the BBQ Dragon works perfectly with them. Clip the Dragon on leg of your ceramic smoker, aim it up the vent, and in minutes have the grill hot enough to cook pizza. \n\n\nClips to anything \n \n\n \n\n\nHow about tailgating? You don't have much time to get the coals going and plugs are scarce – this is the perfect place to use your BBQ Dragon. Same goes for RVing. Bonfire at the beach or a campfire in the woods? The BBQ Dragon sits on the ground and aims at the fire with the adjustable neck. It attaches to any type of smoker, and totally transforms the smoking experience, providing you with unheard-of control over the temperature of. Coals dying down? Temperature dropping? Just dial up the speed of the BBQ Dragon and your smoker heats up instantly. \n\n\nBBQ Dragon fires up pizza ovens \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nProvides amazing heat control on any smoker \n \n\n \n\nFireplaces and wood stoves are suddenly easy to light, using the BBQ Dragon. Fire pits roar to life - no more constantly stuffing them with newspaper, spraying them with lighter fluid or using chemical starters. This changes everything for people who enjoy fires and outdoor cooking.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Design Criteria 1.   It must be hands-free. Who wants to stand around a hot fire holding a hairdryer, waiting for the coals to light?  2.   It must be battery powered. No extension cords, wires, or hand-cranking. It has to be easy to use at the beach, camping, RVing, and other places where plugs are scarce. 3.   It must look great. The product's visual design aesthetic was of utmost importance to us. We knew its performance would be revolutionary and its design had to be too. It had to be stylish and sophisticated to compliment fancy grills and outdoor kitchens, but since it was a tool, the design had to be rugged and durable. We  wanted to raise the design quality far above your typical grill fork and spatula. 4.   Batteries must be rechargeable and replaceable. It must be rechargeable so you are not constantly throwing away expensive batteries, but if you forget to recharge and need to start a fire, you can just throw in a new set of batteries.  5.   It needs to be able to operate for several hours on a single charge and light multiple fires. 6.   It should be weatherproof. This tool will sit out by a grill and be exposed to weather. 7.   It has to attach to anything and stay cool. This was a big challenge, since there are so many types of charcoal grills, not to mention fireplaces, wood stoves, smokers, and fire pits. But we succeeded in creating a novel clip that not only attaches to all these devices, but also keeps the handle away from the fire - cool and safe. 8.  It should be durable, well made, and have the feel of a quality tool that people would be proud to use and show their friends. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Story You probably know the story, because you've done it yourself – fanned the grill with a paper plate, gotten down on your knees and blown on the grill to try to speed it up. Squirted extra lighter fluid on an already-lit fire - how dangerous is that? And it still takes too long to get those coals going. This is what we were doing when we came up with the idea for the BBQ Dragon. Sitting out in the back yard, in the drizzling cold rain, holding a hairdryer with an extension cord to try to speed up the coals - and we thought: There has got to be a better way. It turned out to be easier said than done. Three years later, after twenty prototypes, hundreds of motor, fan, and battery combinations, and dozens of design variations, we finally arrived at the BBQ Dragon you see here: A beautiful combination of mechanical and electronic innovation and visual design excellence that changes the industry it was born into. After using this product, you won't want to start a fire any other way. It's that powerful and life-changing. Rewards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat have we done so far? The BBQ Dragon works great! After three years of full-time development, we have a patent pending in the USA and have filed for protection all over the world. We've also hired a manufacturer and paid for all the tooling, which has been built, and used to produce prototypes. We then refined, tested, refined again, and are now ready for full scale production. We have been to our factory to inspect the parts and tools, and to work out final details about how to mass produce BBQ Dragons. We met the owners of the factories and saw the supply chain first hand. We are ready to manufacture as soon as we meet our funding goals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prototypes you see here were actually manufactured from our tooling, and we have rigorously tested these samples, because we want to produce a product that lasts a lifetime - a quality tool that's as tough as your grill.  We have also designed packaging and engaged manufacturers for that packaging, as well as organized our shipping and fulfillment companies.  We have tested the market viability, both online and in front of real consumers, and were overwhelmed by the response. Almost everyone who saw the BBQ Dragon wanted to buy one! The market loved our product.  We want you to know that your help is truly appreciated. In exchange for your donations, we want you to be the first to have a BBQ Dragon in your hands and on your grill. Production Schedule Our tooling is complete and our factories are ready to start producing BBQ Dragons the moment we are funded. We plan on being able to have the first Dragons ready to ship by summer. \n\n\nThe most beautiful revolution in barbecue \n \n\n \n\nWhy We Need Your Help In order to manufacture the BBQ Dragon at a price that is affordable to the millions of Americans who barbecue and grill, we need to place a large order with our manufacturer. This is a sophisticated and expensive product, with metal tooling, plastic injection-molded parts, motors and fans, advanced printed circuit boards, and expensive batteries, and it's only affordable to consumers if we produce it in large numbers. We've gone the extra mile getting things ready for production, and now we need your help to fund that first order. We'll order as many BBQ Dragons as we can with your support. We know that literally millions of people can use this product, and we want to be able to meet that demand as quickly as possible. Our Team \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're brothers - Bruce and George Prior - and we're experts in mechanical and electronic innovation and invention. Bruce is a mechanical engineer, George spent two decades building and operating ROVs and UAVs, but most importantly we're grilling and barbecuing fanatics. We love the time spent grilling steaks for family barbecues, we love the challenge of smoking the perfect brisket or ribs, and we truly believe that this invention, the BBQ Dragon, will help bring the great tradition of barbecuing to millions of families around the world.  Our branding and web design expert, Bentley DeVilling, joined us after creating the successful music website, http://TheEargazm.com  and also cooks an excellent steak, if you like them rare. \"Great product! Everyone who has a brick oven or a wood-fired oven should start it with the BBQ Dragon, no question. Painless lighting process.\" - Bill Paschen, Chicago Brick Oven \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges We feel that we have done just about everything we can to reduce our risks and challenges. We have been testing and refining this product for 3 years and are confident that it looks and works great. \n\nAs with any product there are risks that come along with mass production. We are working now on a quality control program to ensure that every BBQ Dragon is built to the highest standard and will work well for years to come.\n\nThere is also a risk in not bringing this product to market fast enough. We know that this is a revolutionary product, and even though we have done everything to protect ourselves, we are worried about copy cats. The sooner we can bring the product to market the better a chance we have for reducing that risk.\n\nRight now, our biggest challenge is raising the money for that first, large production run.

Jared Burns, Vincent's brother and partner in this venture, will bring a different perspective to this business.  An an entrepreneur he has founded, managed, and sold several businesses with his most recent being very successful.  Over the years his clients have included companies like EA Sports, Clear Channel, Shopify, Beck, Boyz II Men, David Blaine, and many others.  With this experience he'll help make this business soar. The Vision To bring Spanish-American Burgers and Gourmet Tots to the streets of Denver.  We combine the best flavors of Spain combined with the great American Burger like never before.  El Toro The Tot is a food trailer to be launched in early summer of 2013.  We are offering 5 different Spanish-American style burgers and 3 different varieties of tater tots (regular, cheesy and smoked ham and cheese).  El Toro The Tot will focus on providing high quality lunch, dinner and late night meals for people who are on the go or just want an amazingly delicious classic meal.  The \"burger\" has been around for many decades and many people have done hundreds of variations, but our goal is to adhere to the Spanish art preparing a unique taste by using high quality products as well as proper technique.  The flavors of the burgers and tater tots are one of a kind!  With the combined knowledge and expertise of our chefs, we know how to make this \"burger experience\" one you will want to enjoy over and over. What We Will Serve on the Trailer ~ El Toro - House Beef Blend, Braised Oxtail, Grilled Chorizo, Manchego Cheese, Pickled Red Onion, Arugula, Roasted Garlic Aioli ~ The Americano - House Beef Blend, Sliced Tomato, Aged Cheddar, Iceberg Lettuce, House Made Pickles, Red Onion ~ The Spanish Bleu - House Beef Blend, Valdeon Bleu Cheese, Crispy Onions, Smoked Paprika Aioli, Arugula ~ The B.L.T.A. - House Beef Blend, Crispy Serrano Ham, Shaved Iceberg, Tomato & Sherry Vinegar Jam, Avocado ~ The Veggie - Marinated & Grilled Portobello Mushroom, Manchego Cheese, Charred Onion, Piquillo Peppers, Roasted Garlic Aioli, Arugula Tots: ~ Regular - Potato, Oregano & Smoked Paprika ~ Cheesy - Manchego Cheese, Aged Cheddar, Chives, Smoked Paprika ~ Toro Tots - Smoked Ham & Aged Cheddar Where Will You Find Us Our plan is to serve Denver and the surrounding suburbs.  We hope to participate in events such as Denver Food & Wine, Taste of Colorado, and the Denver Arts Festival.  We will also be available for private events. Use of Funds ~ What We Have Menu: The recipes have been perfected.  The purveyors have been set-up and locked-in.  The food is ready to roll (no pun intended). Licensing & Permits: The business has been established and the permitting process has been established Trailer: We own the trailer and the truck to pull it. ~ What We Need The Equipment: We own the trailer and now it needs to be retrofitted with our equipment. Vehicle Wrap: We need to make it stand-out!!  Detailing will be done to enhance the professional image we plan to project for our business. Giving Back By going mobile and not containing our restaurant to four walls, we can serve the larger Denver metro region.  We also plan to participate in charitable events in the local Denver community.  However, we will also look for opportunities to hit the road and take El Toro The Tot to wherever we can! Risks and challenges We will be confronted with the typical challenges of running a food trailer. We must build up a loyal customer base and properly manage the business. Food Trucks is a rapidly growing business and competition is constantly growing. By offering a unique culinary experience we hope to create and edge over our competitors. The greatest challenge will be the weather of Colorado. During the winter months a bad storm could sideline the trailer for a few days or even a week. We have taken this into account and plan to operate the trailer in an effective manner to account for this. Bad weather could actually be an invitation for us to come to a particular location for the convenience of others. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

After discovering a shared interest in songwriting they began collaborating on a body of work that would form the spine of their optimistic, semi-tragic, and wryly humorous folk-pop songs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir first effort, the four song EP Aim to Please (download HERE ), served as both mission statement and rallying cry. Their goals were two-fold: their music had to accurately represent their struggles with love (or the illusion thereof) while never forgetting to be tuneful.  \"That approach is what we loved so much about the Beatles, or even Dylan, although we would never claim to be as talented, or as well-coiffed.\" says Nathan Smith. Encouraged by the warm reception of their homemade debut, Elbows & Knees set about both expanding and exploring the thematic terrain of Aim to Please, albeit in more polished form (thanks to the co-producing and mixing skills of Nathan's longtime friend Justin Lesamiz). As songs were written, developed, and collected for a follow-up, a title would eventually make itself obvious with Crippled By a Crush . \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, with their 7-song EP recorded and mixed, they are looking to produce physical CDs to send out to agencies, radio stations, and potential listeners.

So why not find another way to tell the REST of the stories we've created?  And what is the best way to tell the action-packed, adrenaline-pumping stories?  In pulp magazines.  \"Amazing Tales of The Wasted Lands\" boldly updates the pulp magazine for you, today's reader. All of the stories contained in each issue take place in Dave Dorman's Wasted Lands - an incredibly fertile world filled with history AND mystery.  The diverse world Dave has created enables us explore all of the various pulp fiction genres, mashing them up in new and unexpected ways! We know you'll find the stories both familiar and unexpected, and that you'll enjoy the twists and turns we take with common tropes of pulp fiction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Kickstarter will be the first of many. Our long-term goal is to produce an issue of Amazing Tales of The Wasted Lands every two months - and to pre-sell issues of it via Kickstarter and our Wasted Lands website, helping us cash-flow the printing and distribution costs.  Unlike other projects we've seen and backed on KS in the past, we felt we needed to be well into our production process before we made an appeal to fans to back this project.  And that time is now.   Yes, this is a self-publishing venture. While we've been working \"on spec\" to create these stories and art for this first issue, we need your help to cover printing and distribution costs. Without your help, we cannot share these great stories with you.  All six stories featured in the first issue are written (stories for Issues #2 and #3 are already outlined). We will complete production by mid-September and release final, proofed files to our printer no later than October 1st (also, Dave Dorman's birthday!). We expect to start shipping materials to backers on or before November 1st.  We have set this campaign to last 4 weeks. We will provide production updates throughout the campaign. You'll be seeing videos of Dave Dorman painting feature illustrations for the magazine's stories, and videos of Mike Bawden revealing some of the secret characters and mock ads created for backers who support this project at those levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***UPDATED: July 31, 2107: We have established three stretch goals based on the number of backers we amass as a part of this first Kickstarter Campaign. The amount each backer contributes to the campaign is irrelevant. We will honor the stretch goal, regardless. Goal #1: If we can get 200 people to back this project, we will include an \"Amazing Tales\" collector's pin with every order we fulfill. Be sure to wear it to a comic con Dave or Mike attend and you'll receive a special \"thank you\" gift for your on-going support of our project. Goal #2: If we can get 500 people to back this project, we will include a collectible, silver-colored coin embossed with the seal of Mortal City (the largest metropolis in The Wasted Lands).  Goal #3: If we can get 1,000 people to back this project, we will include a collectible, gold-colored coin embossed with the Unity seal of the Outlands (the stronghold of Freemen in The Wasted Lands). \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be six stories in the first issue of \"Amazing Tales of The Wasted Lands\" - each featuring unique characters you'll only find in the imagination of a team like illustrator Dave Dorman and writer Mike Bawden. No Time For Gratitude \nMortal City's most misunderstood detective - the one they call Iguana - must rescue the infant son of a local bigwig, only to find out he's in as much danger as the child. From gunfights on rooftops to slugfests on subways, this story has it all: action, adventure, a beautiful woman AND a flying monkey with a chronic gun problem. It's a chippy, hard-boiled, detective story with a sci-fi twist that can only exist in a place like Dave Dorman's Wasted Lands . The Impossible Job \nJoin M. d'Cease, Mortal City's exotic (some say odd) forensic coroner, who loses her job when the Enigma Squad (an elite, crime fighting division of the MCFP*) is terminated only to find adventure and peril lie just around the corner.  Is it possible for her day to get any worse? The answer, apparently, is \"yes.\" Together, we find out that nothing is really \"impossible.\" *MCFP = Mortal City Force Police Into the Rift\n Maxamilian Collier searches his past to understand how his grandfather (the famed historian and archeologist Daniel Collier) was lost while exploring the the enormous canyon known as The Rift . It's an adventure in the tradition of Doc Savage and other great jungle adventure stories as young Max and his grandfather's friends (\"The Midlands Historical Society\") risk life and limb on an adventure that could change The Wasted Lands forever. \n\n\nThe Light Angels (from The Iron Wars) \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Iron Wars \nRead first-person journal accounts of Iron Wars veterans compiled by historical journalist Timothy Jonn. During his research and subsequent reporting, Jonn uncovers insights into the turmoil that now wracks The Wasted Lands - and puts himself at risk by doing so. Inspired by stories of heroism by actual Medal of Honor recipients, the battles and firefights recounted in the stories of these vets recount the honor and heroism of the individuals while reflecting the horrors of a war fought for all the wrong reasons. Showdown at Pine Bluff Edgar \"Edge\" Wallace - a member of the legendary Riders of the Outland Plains - must track down his own history to save a small town from a crew of Hollow Men . You'll see why \"Edge\" is known as the greatest Rider in the history of the Outland Plains as he uses a combination of his wits, toughness and sheer guts to overcome impossible odds. The League of Heroes\n In a time before our contemporary stories of The Wasted Lands, there was a band of heroes who made one last, desperate effort to save civilization. Their exploits are the thing of songs in the Northern Wild. We sing it for you here. Risks and challenges This intellectual property is owned by Dave Dorman and Mike Bawden, protected by copyright and self-published. There are no outside third parties required for approvals prior to release or distribution of materials.\n\nDave Dorman is a commercial illustrator and, at times, is busy producing art for corporate clients and private commissions. This may occasionally limit his availability for appearances. Similarly, Mike Bawden, works full time as a public relations/marketing executive at his own PR firm, so client obligations can affect his availability for appearances, or instantaneous replies to queries.\n\nDave Dorman is now in the final stages (shipping/fulfillment) of his most recent Kickstarter project, Captain Nemo.\n\nAmazing Tales of The Wasted Lands printing will be done off-shore (South Korea) to minimize costs for lower order quantities. The expected production and shipping time from the printer is 22 days. We are allowing for 30. But some events--like Mother Nature's interference--are beyond our control and could delay scheduled deliveries. If this happens, we will notify backers via Kickstarter.\n\nWe will add more answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) as they are received once the campaign is in full swing.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of its 21 issues, Norman Einstein's Sports & Rocket Science Monthly  brought together an all-star roster of writers, photographers, and creators to dish on sports in new and exciting ways. In longform and free form, in mixtapes and photo essays, with depth and humor, the magazine delved into the story behind sports, eschewing the simplistic narratives sports fans are too often fed. For nearly two years, Norman Einstein's Monthly was my life. I started it with just a far-flung hope that I could convince my favorite sportswriters on the internet to go crazy and make stunning work with no restrictions... and to do it all for free. In an online world hurtling rapidly toward the second-by-second update, I decided the magazine would head in the other direction and publish once a month, giving our creators the time to construct and reshape each piece, to build something truly unique. From those naive aspirations, Norman Einstein's grew from a wild experiment into a publication churning out insightful work month by month. To say it exceeded my expectations is an understatement. Now Norman Einstein's very best is being published in one print volume... with help from you! From the roar of a football stadium to the rodeos of the American West, from a hard foul's violent beauty to a penalty shootout's ecstatic panic, from long-shot dreams in forgotten gyms to tragic blunders on the biggest stages, our very best stories go far and wide to prove that everything worthy in sports can be found at every level. The stories we tell touch the universal themes of sports: triumphant, tragic, and all points in-between. That's why we are now pulling our best work into one volume, to give tangible form to our celebration of the ineffable wonder of sports. We're not just making a book. We're making something unique. We're enshrining our words and photos in an edgy package to match the edgy ideas they contain. \n\nNorman Einstein's NORMANTHOLOGY features work by Andrew Reilly of the 35th Street Review, Alex and Ben Birdsall of There Are No Fours, Brian Blickenstaff of Touch & Tactics, Eric Nusbaum and Ted Walker of Pitchers & Poets, Fredorrarci of The Classical, Graydon Gordian of 48 Minutes of Hell, Johnny Saward of Ronald Bellamy's Underachieving All Stars, Stephanie Lim of Limpire, and yours truly, the publisher of the magazine. \nWe're asking you for help realizing our vision. Our goal of $2,000 reflects the cost of printing 250 copies of the Anthology and producing the rewards. If we exceed our goal, we'll print more copies. We want to get this book in as many hands as we can. Every reward level includes a copy of the book, in addition to lots of rad limited-edition swag like prints of our best photos, posters, and t-shirts with our favorite Joe Theismann quote (\"Nobody in football should be called a genius. A genius is a guy like Norman Einstein.\") and so much more!  So support great storytelling and give to the Norman Einstein's NORMANTHOLOGY today! —Cian O'Day REWARDS: \n\n\n\n\nSample spreads from the NORMANTHOLOGY \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n11x17\" poster \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nLimited edition 5x7\" print (2 options) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nLimited edition T-shirt \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nLimited edition 12x18\" print (2 options) \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nKronos-1 \n \n\n \n\n\nTitle: Kronos-1 \nDimensions: 15 feet length x 6 1/2 feet wide x 4 feet tall \nMaterials: Plywood  \nDate: October 2013  \n\nDuration: the sculpture will remain on site for one year after which it will be taken down to be reassembled at a later date. \nFunding: Your backing if successful will used for traveling to the site location, the transport of the materials and fabrication costs. \n Mission Statement: A collaboration by Tyson Skross and Greg Nay taking place on the Pino Family Ranch outside of Carrizozo, New Mexico. The project will consist of a large scale sculpture designed by Tyson and will conclude with a book of images and writings by Greg. The conceptual origin of this shape came from a model kit of a German World War Two Halftrack. The raw shell of this vehicle has a skull like structure and was one of the first things that drew Tyson in. It seemed a fetching metaphor for the death and destruction that these and other vehicles have caused. A device for the ending of life and a catalyst for decay. As this cycle of life is not just a human experience, the object can then be looked at as part of nature. Eventually everything returns to the earth as base elements, becoming re-accumulated, re-configured as minerals – the building blocks of this planet. Used for life by all living things to survive, to build, to protect, to destroy, to be consumed to become part of, to break down. \nThat is why he is drawn to the shape of the halftrack, how it is bluntly illustrative of its role but also contains a mystery like the centre of a gem.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn previous editions of the sculpture, Tyson has made resin moulds, plaster casts and sculptures each time simplifying and abstracting the form. Little by little the form and the ideas behind it evolved into their current shape.  \n\nThis project would make it possible to create a full scale version that is engaged with the surrounding landscape allowing it to further evolve and for the work to move forward. Time permitting the affects of weather and natural occurrences will hopefully contribute towards this goal as the piece is accepted by the land. At the end of the year long project the sculpture will be dismantled. If successful more installations could be conceived with the intent of focusing on different construction materials and an on-going look into how they adapt with their location. \n\n\nExample of the black cast sculptures available in reward #5 \n \n\n \n\nLocation: The Pino Family Ranch seemed the perfect location to situate this sculpture. It lies in the Chihuahuan Desert just outside of the town of Carrizozo in a location that is tied not only to the arts but to the conceptual subject matter of the sculpture. Less than 50 miles from the trinity site where the first test of an atomic bomb took place it is also nestled in-between the formerly gold rich Capitan mountain range and a prehistoric lava field called the valley of fires. A location where oddities in ancient geological history meet one of the most important man made events in recent history. This ties into the title of the piece, kronos-1 a reference to the Greek god of time and a nod to the tradition of naming military vehicles. Not only does the location have a rich history but the Pino Family has a desire to make the ranch and the town of Carrizozo a place where the arts can thrive.  \nFrom the Pino Family: The Pino Ranch is a working ranch in the Southeastern New Mexico high desert, just outside the quirky little town of Carrizozo. The Ranch has been worked and loved by the Pino family for many generations, and recently the family entered into a conservation easement to protect the land from development. The Pino family want to preserve the land for future generations and to honor the many hardworking ancestors that came before them. As the family looks forward, they have ensured that the Ranch will remain a natural haven for the animals, but perhaps also in a new reincarnation, envision the land as a haven for artists, nature lovers, cowboys, and anyone else who just gets what this place is all about. The nearby frontier town of Carrizozo has much the same pioneering artistic spirit, there are galleries to explore and the best salsa this side of the Rio Grande. The potential is here for greatness. Help us fund the first step. xo the CASA PINO \n\n\n\nDrawing similar to what can be expected as part of reward #7 \n \n\n \n\nAbout Us: Tyson is an artist living in Brooklyn and Greg is a writer living in London. We have been working on projects together since we met way back in middle school. These projects resulted in written compositions, visual explorations or simply insight into new subjects. Our last trip took us through London, Berlin and Prague on a trip that explored Brutalist architecture eventually ending at the Sedlec Ossuary. The result was a photographic essay and the influence of the experience on both of our creative endeavors. \n\n\nSedlec Ossuary, Czech Republic \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation shot of Tyson's work \n \n\n \n\nThis project would be the first opportunity to allow us to create a site specific work. Giving us the ability to create a tangible record of our experience in this location while influencing our future ventures.  \n\n\nCalifornia 1999 \n \n\n \n\nFor all of the planning and anticipation that we are putting into this project we are equally excited to find what is waiting for us out there, those unexpected things that will take us by surprise. We don't know where this project will ultimately lead, but that is the most exciting part, and we hope to take you with us. Risks and challenges The biggest challenges in this project are the logistics of having the piece fabricated site unseen and transporting it to the location. \nTyson's years of experience in his day job as an art handler have given him the chance to meet many talented artists and fabricators who have advised him on the creation of this sculpture. Having installed hundreds of exhibitions, coordinating with artists around the world, he feels that he has the knowledge to make this project happen. Along with Greg and the helpful folks of Carrizozo Works there is lots of support on the ground. With your support we are confident in our ability to make this project a reality.

    "textDescription": "Story The Story Low Shoulders  is a narrative of young love, violence, and escapism, and a journey south along the California highway. In many ways, it’s a genre film: the story of a young couple on the lam.  But it’s also a story about story – about the stories we tell ourselves to help make sense of the world, and about how buying into a story can sometimes have unintended consequences.  They were just two\nteenagers at a suburban high school — Annie was a couple grades higher than Billy, Billy was dating Annie's sister — but\nthey were different from the others. At least, they thought they were. Billy saw something in the glint of\nAnnie's eye, and she in turn noticed something in him. So she stole him. Faster than\nyou could say “get your guns out” they were in love and “the only possible\npeople for each other.”  A brazen impulse leads Billy and\nAnnie south along the California highway on a killing spree that brings them\ncloser and closer together, as if together they had no vestige of a beginning,\nno promise of an end. \n\nBut\nwhat would happen when they ran out of California? The Background The idea for Low Shoulders  began when Evan wrote the short play \"Witness to a Murder,\" which was staged in a festival in San Francisco in early 2010. Evan drew inspiration from the music of Andrew Bird, the choreography of a dancer friend, and the iconic Raymond Pettibon graphic seen on the cover on the Sonic Youth album Goo:  \"I stole my sister's boyfriend...Within a week, we killed my parents and hit the road.\"  The staged version of the story was a success. After seeing the play, I (Elijah) approached Evan about turning the piece into a short film. Together, we adapted it into a script, and began to put the film into process. Casting and assembling a crew soon followed, and, thanks to Piano Fight, a Bay Area based theater production company, we were able to get the initial funds and equipment needed to start filming. With a talented cast and crew drawn from the local film and theater communities, we've had some fantastic successes in further developing the vision of Low Shoulders. To this point, we've filmed about half the scenes in the film.  Why We Need Money We've started production on Low Shoulders  and have made significant progress. But we've reached a point where we need some help from the community. We have a few specific things that we need the money for: \nA heavy-duty camera car mount \nThe rental and purchasing of props, including a '68 Chevy Camaro \nFood, gas, and lodging for an essential on-location weekend road trip and shoot in Visalia, CA \nActor stipends \nLocation securement \nPost-production costs: ADR, sound design, mastering, DVD production, and marketing materials \n Financially-speaking, we know exactly what we need to make this happen. Your small donations will add up, and will help us make a fantastic film that will get played in festivals nation- (and hopefully world-) wide. Thanks a million for your support.  \n\nRead More \nTo learn more, visit lowshoulders.wordpress.com . Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story The Story In the end...after an ancient and supernatural illness devastates the minds of the modern world, a reclusive soldier must protect a handful of eight survivors from a rampaging horde of lunatics -- even as a creeping madness threatens to tear them apart from within...welcome to the endless whispers. The Nutshell The Endless Whispers is a feature film to be shot in 2015. Influenced by writers like HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, Robert Bloch, and Stephen King as well as filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski and John Carpenter, the film explores the collapse of human-nature in the face of the unknown. However, along the road to getting the feature made, we want to maximize the impact on potential investors for the feature film as well as providing an amazing and unique experience for our film-goers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, we have an amazing website that is packed full of ever-expanding information setting the stage for the world in which the story takes place. There are 'radio' broadcasts, CB conversations, photos from the character's lives, concept images (see the gallery ), an in-depth timeline that will ultimately reveal where the whispers began and much, much more. One major addition are eight small short films featuring each of the major characters from The Endless Whispers.  These 'featurettes' let you meet our doomed heroes before the world ends. They are separate, but connected, to the feature film. This collection has been dubbed The Endless Whispers Cycle . The first three have already been filmed and you can find the links to them in the list below: \n\nGame Over - Lewis \n\nLike a Colossus - Jackman \n\nSacrifice - Terri (winner, best actress at ENCFF) \n\nHuckleberry - Karen (Blood is thicker than water. Wounds are deep, harsh cuts. You clean both with a shot of whiskey. Then you punch something. Hard.) \n\nForsaken - Dr. Susan Carter (\"I never ask a man what his business is, for it never interests me. What I ask him about are his thoughts and dreams.” ― H.P. Lovecraft) \n\nThe Long Road - Noah (One step in front of the other. Running from the past. Running to the future. For Noah Carter, the two are about to meet.) \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Need Each of the featurettes costs roughly a little over $1900 to shoot. Yes that's $5800 total for ALL THREE FILMS. The first three featurettes were funded by Bombshell Studios, LLC . The company is now solely focused on getting the feature film produced, and we're asking our viewers and, hopefully, potential fans, to help us get the next three featurettes up, running and ready for primetime. These featurettes will impress potential investors for the feature, and help bring The Endless Whispers  to fruition. The shorts will also be used independently to hit the festival circuit. In fact, Clark Sarullo, Terri from our third featurette Sacrifice , just won Best Actress at the Eastern North Carolina Film Festival, in Greenville, NC. So we're already off to a great start. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Get \n$10 Gratuitous and Great Praise. Be listed in the special thanks credits for the featurettes. The Endless Whispers website, Facebook and Twitter will know your AWESOMENESS when we're done singing your praises. Of course you'll have to \"like \" or 'follow ' us so we can do that. Please?! \n$25 Name in Lights. Get a 'special thanks' listing on IMDB for all three featurettes. Plus you get the $10 reward. \n$50 Become a Member of the Doomed . Every week after filming commences, until the films expected release dates in February, we will make a weekend update. Members of the Doomed will have exclusive access to these updates. They will include sneak peeks at scenes in the films, glimpses of behind the scenes activity, director's videos discussing editing choices, and other stuff (though hopefully nothing that awakens the-thing-that-should-slumber.) Also, one truly special reward: you will be given a free access download to the final films one week before they are released so you can tell everyone you saw it first and keep a copy for yourself! Finally, you get to claim the $10 and $25 rewards as well. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$75 Power in the Word.

Nytro is old school heavy metal like Sabbath, Maiden and Priest. Plus you get the $10, $25 and $50 rewards. \n$100 Snapshot! A signed* still from your favorite featurette. Not only do you pick the featurette, you get to choose the exact still. *We'll assume you want the signature of the actor in the still you choose but you can request it be signed by any one member of the cast or crew instead, i.e. director, dp, producer, designer etc.) Plus you get the $10, $25 and $50 rewards. BONUS EXCLUSIVE REWARD: 1 dozen Scream Cream Oatmeal Pumpkin Cranberry Spice cookies baked specially by Scream Queen Kirsten Ray (and they are amazing!) \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$300 I love art!

Get a one-of-a-kind signed poster (see examples below and note, these are posters from the first shorts, your poster will come from Huckleberry, Forsaken or The Long Road) of each short, your choice (note: since only one will be offered for each choice, first person to pledge gets first choice of poster.) This will be a full sized movie poster signed by the director. Plus you get the $10, $25, $50 and $100 rewards.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$2,000 Superstar! Play a MAJOR role in a featurette.

Epilogue The Endless Whispers is an ambitious project with many people involved. These featurettes are a small little window into this \"alternate world\" that is going to make the greater project a creation of pride for everyone involved and terrify you along the way. And don't forget to like or follow us on Facebook and Twitter for all the latest! Risks and challenges The greatest risk is that something terrible and unspeakable is awoken and the world ends. That's kind of a bummer.\n\nThat said, these are films and there are always issues that arise, i.e. reshoots, delays in visual effects, etc. But with your help we will be able to keep this issues to a minimum and when they arise over come them.

My shop has continued to grow and expand and I am so lucky and thankful for all my success. \n\n\nOne of the many shop logos \n \n\n \n I would like to expand my shop once more but sadly money is tight. The money raised will be used to buy more materials to make new collars. These are my plans/descriptions of my new designs: Purple Vinyl Collar*Purple see through vinyl with buckle*10mm and 20mm silver spikes  Rose Collar*Black velvet fabric*Small and large roses stitched on, covering fabric Double O-ring Collar*Like the original o-ring collar, with a larger o-ring Harley Quinn Love Collar*Black and red faux faux leather*10mm silver or black spikes *Harley's diamonds drawn on Heart Locket with O-ring Collar*heart locket with key*Large o-ring*black faux leather or clear vinyl   Risks and challenges If my project is successfully funded there could still be a chance of not having enough money or sales to fulfill the expansion. And this is fine because I know I tried and if I save up and continue making more items I could reach my goal on my own. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Contributors! I’m excited by the people who have agreed to contribute to this project! So far, I have confirmed:\n\n \nErik of Tenkar’s Tavern  will contribute a bonus level to the Vault of the Goblin. \nKevin Chenevert of Red Kobold fame will contribute art, and has also agreed to contribute some of his incredible blue dungeon tiles to the boxed sets! \n  More contributors to come! \n \n\n\n\n\n\nIt started with a simple enough proposition. Imagine for a moment that you were tasked with acting as lead designer for the NEXT edition of the world’s greatest RPG system. What would you do? Where would you start?\n\n\n\n\nFor me, it’s the 1981 BX rules. For me, it’s by beginning with what the game’s grandfathers started with – a simple set of rules, a world to explore, and a mighty dungeon to delve. The game grew out of those three things, and if I was to develop the next edition, that’s where we’d have to go back to.  \n\n\n\n\nHowever, this game would also need stellar art – not only on the cover, but throughout the book – by some fantastic artists. It would need to be carefully tested and edited. It would need to be clear, easy to learn, and intuitive. It would need to be polished.\nAnd, finally, it would need to belong to the community from which it came.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of that is the project I present to you: Saga of the Splintered Realm. This funded project would create three books:  \n\n\nBook 1: Core Rules. All of the fundamental rules needed to play the game. This is not a retro-clone. It is a modern re-imagining of classic rules. The goal is to retain the spirit of the original rules and key ‘classic’ game concepts, simplifying and re-organizing these for quicker play and unified mechanics.  \n\n Book 2: Campaign Setting. An overview of the Splintered Realm, the default game setting. This includes the campaign world, its major locales, unique creatures and spells, and unique game rules, including a fate game mechanic, and subclass options for each class.  \n\nBook 3: Vault of the Goblin. The megadungeon that acts as the hub of much activity in the Splintered Realm. This is composed of three primary levels with dozens of sub-levels that interconnect. This book would also include an overview of the keep and surrounding countryside near the Vault.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, producing books is not enough. We also need to give this back to the community. This means that if this project funds: \n \n\nThe books would go up as Pay What You Want on RPGNow, meaning that new players could get all of the rules and game materials at no charge (if they so desired). \nThe print editions would be locked in at $9.95 each, regardless of how high the page count goes!  \nALL game content would be released under either the OGL or an unrestricted Creative Commons License (as applicable). This means that you could re-use, re-purpose and re-mix these rules (for commercial purposes, if you wanted) with virtually no restriction (except for the existing restrictions of the OGL).  \nALL art and ALL maps (including those produced by professional artists) would go into the public domain – you would be able to use, re-use and re-publish the art with absolutely no restriction. \nYour PDF reward includes digital copies not only of the game, but high-quality image files of every piece of art and every map, for you to use, re-use and re-publish as you want!  \n \nWhy Should I Back the KS?  \nAs a backer, you will get exclusive content IN EACH BOOK that is not part of the release that goes to the public after the KS ends. You will also have access to special perks that only backers will get, increasing as the campaign goes on. Finally, only KS backers will have access to the boxed sets; after the KS ends, the boxed sets (and all bonus materials) will go out of print. Thereafter, people will be able to purchase each book individually, although these will not be the limited edition copies with bonus material.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding Goals:  \n$1000. Funded!  The game is a go. I will produce three 64+ page books, each 6”x9”. All of the artwork produced, and all of the maps created, go into the public domain, for you to use as you want.  \n$2,000: GOAL MET!  Each book expands to 80+ pages. We have an art budget! I will allocate 20% of the total KS funds raised to an art budget ($400+ at this stretch goal), using this as wisely as possible, to get as many high-quality pieces (some from classic OSR artists) as I can.  \n$3,000: GOAL MET!  Each book expands to 96+ pages. The art budget bumps to $600+. Each boxed set includes a poster map of the Splintered Realm on one side, the City of Nethil Bay on the other.  \n$5,000 (LOCKED). Each book expands to 112+ pages. The art budget bumps to $1,000+. Each boxed set includes poster maps of the Vault of the Goblin.  \n$7,500 (LOCKED). Each book expands to 128+ pages. The art budget bumps to $1,500+. Each boxed set includes a pad of character sheets. \n \n$10,000 (LOCKED). Each book expands to 144+ pages. The art budget bumps to $2,000+. Each boxed set includes a special surprise!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n Risks and challenges This is a big project, and it's going to involve other people - those are factors that can lead to delays.\n\nHowever, I've run two successful Kickstarters, and both have remained on schedule. This project is the largest in scope of the three, but I'm building in ample lead time to complete the project in a reasonable time frame. While I will be commissioning artists to do work, I'll also be able to give them as much as 6 months to complete work, which should be more than sufficient to keep things on schedule.\n\nI've been publishing RPGs and comics for over 20 years, and have released over 50 different self-published works. I'm excited for this - the biggest project I've ever done! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Many of you know the routine by now. For those who don’t, here’s the scoop!\nWe are using Kickstarter to take pre-orders and sell subscriptions for our 2017 issues. As usual, all stories have been paid for.   Our cover artists are paid. Layout is more or less done, and Issue 5 is already in the hands of our copy editors. What do we have in store for 2017?\n  Our Spring issue (Cirsova #5) primarily features stories from Misha Burnett's Eldritch Earth Geophysical Society, a writing group devoted to telling Burroughsian adventure stories set on a pre-historic Lovecraftian Earth. Expect unspeakable monsters from the stars, cultists, sorcerers, lizardmen, crabmen, fishmen (and fishwomen) and every manner of daring rogue! Also, Adrian Cole’s Witchfinder Arrul Voruum investigates the lingering evil in Karkesh in an all new Dream Lords story, Michael Tierney cooks up a historical fantasy with Bears of 1812, and Lynn Rushlau tells of daring escape in Through the Star-Thorn Maze.  Plus, the latest installment in James Hutchings' My Name is John Carter.

Both 2017 issues will be approximately the same page-count, so there will not be an issue of one item having a substantially different unit cost as was the case with our winter issue. We will be attempting to sell advertisement again through Kickstarter. To simplify things, anyone pledging for a advertising slot can add to their pledge at whatever level they would like to back to include physical copies. To keep matters simple, advertisers buying ads through Kickstarter do not need to worry about shipping costs if they are outside the US. You want the back cover ad and both softcover copies? Just pledge $120, and we'll sent them anywhere in the world at no extra charge. If you want adspace in both issues, pledge for #5 and double your pledged amount. 1/4 Page – 3.5″ w x 4.5″ h 300 DPI Back Cover – 7-8″ w x 8.75″ h 300 DPI Please prepare ad images as high res .PNG or .TIF files. Advertisements for Issue 5 should be sent to no later than one week after the end of the Kickstarter. Stretch Goal: $4000 Two issues in 2018. Right now, we're looking at having just enough money for one issue, maybe enough for 1/4 to 1/2 of another, not counting art. A lot of Cirsova Publishing's discretionary funds are tied up in a Leigh Brackett project, so we'll need additional capital to ensure that we can put out two issues next year and that I won't have to dip further into personal funds to see that it happens.  Stretch Goal: $5000 If you're an author considering submitting to Cirsova, you want to see this happen. Reaching $5000 will allow us to have an open submission period. This will give us the financial flexibility we need to squeeze in good stories here and there that we might otherwise have to pass up. Stretch Goal: $8000 At this point, we can certainly have open submissions, possibly keep the issues as thick as we are this year (128 pages) or maybe even have three issues. Plus, this could put us in a position where mailing from our HQ would be feasible, cheaper, and less time consuming than manually entering dropshipment info by hand into Amazon. Risks and challenges Like our last pre-order Kickstarter, backers are taking a bigger gamble, as they will be pledging for two issues which will not be sent right away. \n\nHowever, Cirsova has a proven track record of delivering in a timely manner, adhering to our release schedule.\n\nAs in the past, all story content is paid for. Our volunteers have been doing wonderful turn-around work on deep pass copy-edits, and I expect them to continue doing so.\n\nWhile things are still on an upward track for us, our coffers did hit empty after making 2017 acquisitions. Still, it's all paid for and we don't have any expenses that will prevent the issues from being completed. Rest assured that following the success of this Kickstarter we will have funds to cover all expenses related to fulfilling backer rewards. However, we WILL need to go above and beyond our goals for 2017 subscriptions to remain viable as a semi-pro paying market into 2018.

    "textDescription": "Story Funded! Funding has ended on Kickstarter but you can keep up with the latest \ngoings on in the world of LEGO Chess Sets at LEGOMyChessSet.com , \nincluding ordering sets and instructions.  \n\nThanks for all your support and encouragement! New!  Chess Board included with every reward, King or higher! See Updates #9 and #10 for details! \nDid you see us on DaddyTips ? \n Background When my oldest son was in Kindergarten, he started learning to play chess.  We had some cheap sets around that worked, but I got to thinking about how I'd always wanted a nice set.  Mind you, I'm not terribly good at the game, but I do enjoy playing.  So I began looking at chess sets (nice ones are expensive!) and then thought about making one of my own.  I'd always liked the salt-and-pepper sets I'd seen and the nuts-and-bolts sets are really cool (though I'm not really a fix-it kind of guy), but neither was what I really wanted.  I thought about what was important to me -- my kids -- and what that meant. All my kids love LEGO -- really, who doesn't? -- and it seemed a natural medium for putting together a chess set.  I did some searching and found nothing I liked, so I designed my own. Those who know me might laugh but, in a lot of ways, I'm rather conservative and traditional.  So what appealed to me was a set inspired by the classic Staunton chess men.  Over the course of about a year, I idly played with my kids' LEGO while working at home to come up with the chess pieces.  I spent a lot of time -- and money -- on the independent BrickLink.com website looking for just the right pieces. Eventually, I came up with a set I'm really proud of.  And now I'd like to share it with the whole LEGO-loving, chess-playing world. Note: LEGO® is a registered trademark of The LEGO Group.  Neither I nor this project are in any way affiliated with The LEGO Group, other than as a customer buying a ton of bricks.  Introducing The Pieces Here's a cheesy video I made with pieces running onto the field as if they were football players.  It's not terribly good, but the music is nice and I like it.  Give it a look to see the pieces in action, or scroll on down to see some much nicer photos.  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nSo I don't think I'll be quitting my day job to become an animator any time soon. The music is Kreisler's Miniature Viennese March performed by the Eroica Trio , by way of the Free Music Archive . The LEGO Chess Set\n Each piece measures 4 studs by 4 studs and ranges in height from 10 bricks (3.85\" or 98mm) for the stately king down to 5-2/3 bricks (2.2\" or 56mm) for the lowly pawn. Each piece is either white or black with dark grey accent pieces. The king stands tallest, with an additional accent piece and white/black cone to replace the traditional cross. The rook features the traditional crenelations of a castle wall and the bishop has the pointy hat so popular with the clergy. The knight maintains the distinctive horse shape, evoking the shape of the piece's move. All the pieces share a common base. Here are the individual pieces: \n\n\nThe Kings and Queens and the lowly Pawns \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBishops, Knights, and Rooks \n \n\n \n\n\nAnd here are all the pieces together: \n\n\nFrom left to right: King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, and Pawn \n \n\n \n\n\nHere are the full chess sets ready to play: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of 394 bricks in the complete set.  The pieces range from 10 bricks to 19 bricks each.  I do have a couple of stretch goals in mind that would boost that by 20 and 36 bricks, for a possible total of 450 bricks. Ezra Chimes In When I was 3 or 4 years old, I was playing with my toy drill while my mom had tea with a friend.  I wanted my drill to be just like my dad's, so I tied a string around the handle and then tied a paperclip to the end and spread it apart like an electrical plug. And then I plugged it in.  Like father, like son -- my son Ezra also made a LEGO chess set -- or at least part of one.  Luckily, it's a lot safer than sticking a paperclip into a wall outlet.  He wanted to show off his two-in-one chess piece and so he recorded some videos to do so and to help out with the project.  I put together some of the clips into a single video.  At one point (when he was talking about my parents being friends with a couple that had a metal chess set) he was reading from the notes I had tacked up for myself, but other than that, it's all him.  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nAnd perhaps a star is born.  Or at least another Marx brother. Sara's Turn The only time my daughter isn't performing is when she's asleep, so when I had the camcorder set up, she wasn't about to pass up the chance to record a video. So, here she is, complete with kitty ears, talking about the LEGO Chess Set. This was all spontaneous and made up on the spot by Sara. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nYou can find out more about Sara at her website .\n Kickstarter I first discovered Kickstarter when a band I really like (Renegade Stringband -- you should really check 'em out and go to all their shows!) used it to fund an album.  After that, I was hooked.  I've backed other albums, a few photography gadgets (the Capture Clip system is awesome!), and some toys and games.  I'm a big fan of the notion of empowering inventors and designers so that they can bring their dreams to life without having to produce enough profit to keep traditional investors happy. The way I see it, making a huge profit isn't what it's about; the whole point is to contribute something to the world and make your idea a reality.  I'd like to be able to tell my kids (and, someday, grandkids) that, yeah, I made those LEGO chess sets and people liked them and backed my project.  I may make a little money from this, but not a significant amount.  (And most of it will likely go towards backing other kickstarter projects.) Timeline I've planned an aggressive but reasonable timeline for this project.  I think it's entirely doable, but my target date is early enough that even if there is some slippage, I will have the chess sets in the hands of backers before the holidays. Here's how I see it unfolding: Sept  1 - Project goes liveSept 30 - Project endsSept 30 - LEGO parts Orders placedOct 15  - Funds receivedNov 1   - Orders received, Packing begins (possibly earlier)Nov 15  - All orders shipped \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've allowed for a month for the LEGO parts to be delivered because I don't know how long it takes for orders to arrive from LEGO and it is possible that, if an amazing number of backers sign up for a full chess set, I might need to order some parts from Europe. Funding Breakdown My project goal is based on ten backers at the king or higher level.  Less than that and I likely wouldn't recoup my costs.  More than that and I can start to add some stretch rewards -- I do have a few in mind.  The goal includes the cost of parts to compile the sets, the printing of the instructions, and, of course, the Kickstarter and Amazon fees.  Here's what I've got budgeted:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards The rewards are listed on the right side of this page (assuming Kickstarter doesn't change their layout).  This is some more detail about each one. Pawn If you'd just like to contribute something toward the project, this is the level for you.  Any amount will get you my heartfelt thanks and your name listed on the website at LEGOMyChessSet.com . Knight For a contribution of $5 or more, I will send you a custom-made postcard featuring the chess set with my thanks.  I'm definitely not a great photographer, but I have taken a few nice pictures and I do have a very nice camera, so I'll come up with a cool postcard for you.  You'll also get all the benefits of the Pawn level. Bishop - Digital Only So you just want to know how to make your own set?  Here's your copy of the instructions in all its digital glory e-mailed straight to your inbox.  With this and enough LEGOs, you'll have your own chess set in no time. Bishop If you have plenty of LEGOs already but want a signed, printed copy of the instructions for building the chess set with your own pieces, this is the reward for you.  You can also choose not to have it signed, but who knows -- I might be famous some day and it could become really valuable.  Or maybe infamous.  Either way, you'll also get everything from the Knight level plus, of course, the digital version. Rook If you've already got a nice chess set or you want to build it with your own parts, you might like this reward.  You'll get everything from the Bishop reward plus a neat \"LEGO my chess set!\" t-shirt.  Come on, you know you want one.  It's going to be THE fashion hit of the season!  You'll get the t-shirt, the printed instructions, the postcard, your name on the website, and my thanks. Queen Performing runs in my family, on both sides.  That means my daughter got a double dose of the stage gene.  She is performing non-stop, 24/7 -- my life is like a Disney musical most of the time.  If that intrigues you, you can back the project at the Queen level and she will make up and perform an original work singing your praises.  I will video it and you'll get the digital file, plus everything from the bishop level.  You can find out more about her at her website (which she doesn't know about so please don't tell her.) King (Extra Early Bird) You want the actual chess set?  You got it, and a super bargain price, too.  You'll get the full set -- enough parts to make all thirty-two pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king, each in both black and white.  In addition, you'll get everything from the Bishop level, including the printed instructions. Note: I'm able to offer this reward because I have several sets' worth of (brand new) pieces left over from when I was originally designing the set.  (I bought a lot of extras.)  They're all new and the same as I would get now; the difference is that they're already paid for and they're not doing anyone any good sitting on my shelf. King (Early Bird) If you missed out on the Extra Early Bird rewards, you can still get a heck of a deal on the full set, plus everything from the Bishop level. King Even if you missed out on both early bird rewards, you can still get the chess set.  This is it!  Again, you'll get the full set -- enough parts to make all thirty-two pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king, each in both black and white -- as well as everything from the Bishop level. Master You're hot stuff and you want the world to know it, but you also want the chess set?  Here's your reward -- it includes an original song as per the Queen level, the full chess set just like the King level, and, of course, everything from the Bishop level.  (Really, it's the King level -- which already includes the Bishop level -- plus the song.) Decoy This one is for locals only!  You get one of my mother-in-law's famous egg nog cakes.  These are pretty spectacular and when she donates one to my kids' school's winter gala auction, they regularly sell for more than $60.  You'll get the cake, plus everything from the King level. Gambit This one is for locals only!  A little Jewish penicillin!  Actually, a lot of Jewish penicillin.  It's two gallons of my homemade Chicken Matzoh Ball soup.  This'll cure what ails ya.  Whenever there's a potluck at the kids' school, everyone -- kids and parents alike -- ask me to bring it, and the principal always shows up to get some.  Note that, unlike traditional soup, I leave the chicken, onion, and carrots in the soup, so it's really a full meal.  You'll get the soup, plus everything from the King level (the chess set, etc.). Grandmaster This is the jackpot!  You'll get everything -- the complete chess set, the t-shirt, an original song, instructions, postcard, thanks, your name on the website, a carrying case for the chess set, and, if you're local, the soup and a cake. Some of these rewards are limited, so if you see one you like, jump on it right away.  Here's a handy little chart that sums up all the rewards: \n\n\nRewards Summary Chart \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Project Video Lastly, a quick note about the project video.  When I started making it, I knew I was no Jimmy Stewart or Dustin Hoffman.  By the time I was done, I knew I was no Pauly Shore.  In addition, I am definitely not a cinematographer -- I'm expecting the Hollywood police department to show up any minute now and confiscate my camcorder for crimes against humanity.  My apologies to all. Risks and challenges Risk: The 3676 Problem\nOne of the pieces in my original design -- #3676, Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Double Convex -- is relatively rare. If there is greater demand than there is supply of this piece, I would not be able to complete all the sets as originally designed.\n\nI have already secured enough of these pieces to complete at least 100 chess sets. If, however, there is greater demand, I will have to alter the design and provide alternative parts. Fortunately, I have come up with an alternative solution using readily available parts. It's not quite as nice, in my opinion, but it's still quite pleasing. If there are more than 100 backers, the early bird backers and backers at the Master level and above will get the original design first. Remaining sets will be fulfilled with the original design until I run out after which parts for the alternate design will be provided.\n\nThe instructions will include both designs. \n\nRisk: Too Much Success\nThere are certainly worse problems to have. I am currently projecting that no more than 100 backers will want a complete chess set. If the project goes significantly beyond that, it is possible that orders of lego parts could take longer than expected and packing/shipping the sets could be overwhelming for my wife and I and our three kids.\n\nIn that case I have several options prepared -- I am very fortunate in that my 12-year-old son has a lot of very responsible friends and classmates, quite a few of whom have parents who run their own companies and businesses. I feel very confident that I can find additional help to deal with an unexpected success. Plus, I've always wanted to have my very own army of minions. \n\nRisk: Cost overruns\nMy focus for this project is to share the chess set (hence the free downloadable plans) rather than make money.\n\nI am definitely not rich but between my wife and I, we get by comfortably. My wife is incredibly supportive (school teachers are like that) and we can easily skip a few Burrito Nights to pay for unforseen costs, including hiring additional help to sort and pack lego pieces.\n\nRisk: Skipping town\nI've backed some projects which never delivered (*cough*Jorno*cough*) so I'm well aware that Kickstarter could be used to defraud backers of their money with no intent whatsoever of delivering anything at all.\n\nThat won't happen with this project. I'm a homeowner -- the house I grew up in -- with three kids and strong ties to the community. I'm the president of an Atari user group, on the board of directors of a local theatre company, and have been in my current job ten years. My in-laws and one brother-in-law live in San Francisco as I do; the other brother-in-law lives across the bay and we work for the same company. I'm not going anywhere and I'm committed to seeing this through. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Fire in the Radio hails from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The band, who derives their name from the Charles Bukowski poem “Regard Me,\" has a unique sound that has been appropriately described as an amalgamation of Jawbreaker, Tigers Jaw, Weezer and Title Fight. Last year, Fire in the Radio spent time at Inner Ear studios in Washington, DC, with engineer Don Zientara (Fugazi) doing a series of demos. The demos turned into the foundation for a full-length record that was recorded in the summer of 2014 at Miner Street Studios in Philadelphia (The Menzingers, Restorations) with producer Thom Flowers (Lagwagon) and engineer Matt Schimelfenig (Cayetana). The record was mixed by Jesse Gander (Japandroids) at Rain City Recorders in Vancouver, with additional engineering by Angus Cooke. It was mastered by Alan Douches in New York, and is set for release on May 12, 2015. As part of the promotion for the record, Fire in the Radio began filming a series of short video episodes that depict the dark comedic account of fictional character Donald Caldwell, a drummer who is struggling to find a more prominent role in his band (and in life). Each video is sound tracked by one of the songs off the \"Telemetry\" record. When viewed together, it is intended that the videos serve as a charming Wes Anderson-style short film. In order to finish this video series properly and find out what happens to our fictional character, we need your help! Below we have put together a series of great packages to send you for supporting this project. They include copies of our new record, some great t-shirt designs, and even an opportunity to appear in one of the webisodes.

    "textDescription": "Story Choose to Find's second album Songs Without Words has been in the works for 3 years now and it is almost finished. We decided to produce and fund this record on our own to retain creative control over the music and sound. We have spent countless hours at many studios toiling over sounds, parts, arrangements, and hundreds of other minute details to craft as close to a masterpiece as we can. When we set out to record this album, we wanted to capture the group as we sound when we perform live. Because of the unique instrumentation we employ, this task is a more daunting challenge than one might expect. The acoustic piano by nature is relatively quiet compared to Colin and Andy's amplifiers, not to mention G. Maxwell's huge drum sound. This required some very creative recording techniques. Thus, we enlisted the help of a couple of fantastic engineers: John Shipp (Aerosmith, Electric Light Orchestra) and Rafi Sofer (James Taylor, Juliana Hatfield) . We spent weeks tracking drums and piano in big, beautiful rooms, percussion in a large high school auditorium, bass with fat, old tube amps, and piles of guitar amps, old and new, at several funky locations. Through the process of producing Songs Without Words , the collection of songs evolved into a really intriguing piece of art worthy of repeated listens. We have been able to achieve sounds that have surpassed our expectations and we are incredibly excited about getting the record out to our fans. This is where you come in... We are now at the mixing stage. After that is mastering and finally, replication. Mixing will cost $2100, mastering is $1300, and replication is $1600. We're hoping that you can help us reach our financial goal of $5000 within 60 days to complete the final stages of Songs Without Words . With your assistance, we might be able to get the record finished before 2012 gets here, which would put the record in your hands very soon. We are truly grateful for your support.

    "textDescription": "Story ABOUT THE SHOW Moments Defined is a show created around the moments in a person's life, which change, shape, inspire and define us. I believe that each memorable moment in time, the ones that truly transform us, precious or imperfect, leave an everlasting imprint on us, concrete as a snap shot. Moments Defined brings these snap shots to life, raw and real, articulated through movement. I believe that dance moves us to feel deeply, and when expressed honestly it can leave a lasting impression....My wish is to leave a reflection of the complex beauty of these momentous moments on everyone who experiences Moments Defined. ABOUT THE COMPANY STILL MOTION is an exciting new dance company made up of unique, multi-disiplinary and exceptional artists from all over North America. Still Motion's journey began with sold out performances at our world premiere of Moments Defined in Los Angeles , November of 2012.  Since then we have also performed at National Dance Day and at Dizzy Feet's Annual Gala.  I am so excited to announce we will be having a NYC premiere of Moments Defined this summer at the Kaye Playhouse, NYC June 4th & 5th! I am so inspired to reshape the existing show and continue to grow as artists as we bring Moments Defined to life in the city which makes me feel the most alive.....NEW YORK!!! COMPANY MEMBERS Melanie Moore, Kathryn McCormick, Jessica Keller, Jason Parsons, Anthony Morigerato, Kevin Tookey, Chantel Aguirre, Chelsea Thedinga, Gillian Abbott, Bruce Weber, Makenzie Dustman and special guest Gene Gabriel. THANK YOU!!!!!!! I am so extremely grateful to everyone who participated in my last KickStarter Campaign. I was overwhelmed and overjoyed by the amount of support we were given. To be honest I couldn't have done my last show without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope to continue to have you be a part of my exciting journey. GOALS WITH FUNDING My kickstarter goal is to raise $25,000 to pay for the initial costs of putting on MOMENTS DEFINED in NYC. Funds will go towards: theatre rental, lighting design, sound design, travel and accommodations, costume design, rehearsal space, publicity, marketing and most importantly... artists salaries. Reaching my $25,000 goal will assist me to cover the initial production costs of Moments Defined . Although this will be a great start in funding ,the entire cost of putting on this premiere performance of Moments Defined will be closer $60,000.  HOW YOU CAN HELP BE A PART OF THE STILL MOTION FAMILY I would be truly grateful for any amount given towards this production of MOMENTS DEFINED . Reaching this goal will enable me to see my vision brought to life and keep me reaching towards my next goal which would be a  tour of \"Moments Defined\" to the \"Great White North\" the fall of 2014! Presenting this show in Canada and coming full circle to where I began my journey would mean the world to me. NOTE FROM STACEY Thank you in advance for taking time and investing in my dream. Without you it would not be possible. Whether its $10 or $10,000 I am so extremely grateful and humbled by your help.

It seems incredible that these 28 actors ranging in age from 5-17 can pull off a play of this magnitude. They do and do so in a very Professional Manner.You will be amazed at what this group of dedicated students is able to accomplish. Hearts and minds grow, self confidence changes and audiences are moved by the performances of these youths.You will be astounded at what these students accomplish in less than 100 hours of rehearsal. Rowen Matkins and Marc Weinblatt, Co-Directors, have worked miracles with these plays before and seem to have surpassed those performances in this production of the Odyssey. These students will not only know their parts but will also know how to operate the giant Cyclops and the six headed Scylla! Lisa Doray, Technical Director, and Thaddeus Jurczynski, master puppet creator, helped the students to design, construct and oversee the construction of the puppets, masks, costumes and other technical components of the production.

However we need VOLUNTEERS to assist in setting up the space, providing support at the box office and in getting the word out through posters and flyers to attend the play! \n\nThis play will take place and there will be issues however with the community involvement we are confident that any challenge will be meet promptly and effectively .\n\nOn challenge is attendance of the performances however we will work with local newspapers and radio stations to get the word out. We anticipate 800 in attendance throughout the 6 performances but this number depends on locals, friends and family. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Neu- jetzt deutschsprachige Beschreibung nach der englischen Bocusini – the world‘s first plug & play 3D Food Printing system Bocusini is an easy-to-use open source food printing system for gastronomy, patisserie and home applications. It consists of a heated food printing head mounted to a standard 3D printer, a selection of easy to change cartridges with printable food, an intuitive user interface and the Bocusini.com web platform with creative food designs and recipes. Why did we start the projec t Bocusini? We are determined to open up the fascinating world of food printing for everyone. For this, we have developed Bocusini, the most affordable 3D food printing system. The Bocusini printer can be used right out of the box. It is plug & play. This makes it the perfect tool for creative chefs or confectioners as well as for creative end users. \n\n\nBocusini for chefs, confectioners & creative end users \n \n\n \n\n\nJust plug in the printer, drag & drop your favorite designs from the Bocusini web platform, or easily create your own food ideas on your smart device - without prior software installation or food printing knowledge - like the in the example below, our confectionary \"Prince Charming\" with frogs 3D printed from marzipan: \n\n\nPrinted Marzipan Frog on cookie as \"Kiss the Frog\" \n \n\n \n\n\nInsert your food cartridge in the Bocusini and watch your creative food items and pictures being formed within several minutes. Surprise your customers, family, friends or guests with your delicious food creations in sweet or savory.  What is food printing? There is nothing mysterious about food printing – it is just the dosing of a food product like melted chocolate, mashed potatoes or a cookie dough layer by layer onto a plate by a small nozzle – the principle of food printing is nothing more than a very precise automatically controlled pastry bag.  What is Bocusini? We created the Bocusini food printing system for your easy entry into the world of food printing. This is made possible by the following elements: 1. Out-of-the-box Bocusini food printer systems based on our heated 3D food printing head. \n\n\nBocusini Pro \n \n\n \n\n\nIn addition to the complete system, we will also offer a retrofit food printer head kit that will work on several open source 3D printer models (until now it works on Printrbot Simple and Printrbot Maker as well as on Ultimaker 2). \n\n\nBocusini Retrofit Kits \n \n\n \n\n\n2.\tPrefilled Bocusini food cartridges (we will commercially offer ready-to-use food cartridges optimized for printing, but with a bit of knowledge you can also fill them yourself). All our food cartridges are based on natural foods (btw. we are working on a refill concept for increased sustainability). \n\n\nReady to use Bocusini Marzipan Cartridge \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Bocusini cartridges will come in volumes of 60 ml, thus contain up to 100 g of the food product - making it really productive as the following example illustrates: \n\n\nBuilding up to 15 skyscrapers with only one cartridge \n \n\n \n\n\n3.\tBocusini.com  our 3D food printing web platform (www.bocusini.com ) will guide you through different food worlds with printable food designs, recipes, preparation and serving instructions, and downloadable templates, containing 3D print files and printing conditions. \n\n\nBocusini web platform \n \n\n \n\n\n4.\tIntuitive user interface for the easy creation of your own objects on a smart device (tablet or smartphone) without any prior software installation. For our demonstrator within the kickstarter campaign we used software, interface and WIFI control of Doodle3D (doodle3d.com ). In addition, we presently explore a next generation open source graphical user interface optimised for 3D food printing.  \n\nAll parts of the Bocusini food printing system (user interface, firmware for printing) and all templates will be open source. We also want to encourage you to create your own templates and food deisgns for printing. How does the Bocusini work? With Bocusini your focus will be on creativity and fun - not on the technical details. Food printing is kept simple and will be achieved with only 3 steps: \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n1.\tLoad the bocusini food printer with a food capsule of your choice 2.\tCreate your own design or download a printing template onto your smart device and select the printing conditions for your food capsule 3.\tPut your plate to the printer and start printing.   That’s all. Within several minutes your individually created and delicious food object will be printed. Which food products may be printed with the Bocusini? We are continuously developing and adding new food products. So far we can successfully print more than 30 different food products. These are part of the six most important food categories: Confectionary (choci, marzipan, chewing gum, fudge, jelly), bakery products (cookie, meringue, biscuit), snack products (potato crisps, savoury snacks), fruit & vegetable Products (all kind of fruit purees, fruit sauces, fruit jellies or gelled vegetables), meat products (different pates and meat spreads) and dairy products (cream cheese or yoghurt). In the beginning, we will offer pre-filled Bocusini cartridges with marzipan, choci and fudge, and over time release several others along with the related food worlds on Bocusini.com , our market place and forum for printable food (www.bocusini.com ). Of course, we also encourage food enthusiasts to develop their own recipes and refill their capsules - and will support them with instructions and recommendations. Hence you will also have the possibility to print food objects you created yourself.  Why do we need your support to make the Bocusini project a success? As already mentioned, the major motivation for the development of the Bocusini food printing system was to make 3D food printing available to everyone. To achieve this, we need your support regarding the following goals: 1.\tImprovement of the product design regarding ease of use and easy of  assembly 2.\tDevelopment of the food capsules and refill packs of printable foods with focus on ease of use, sustainability, and to achieve required food approvals 3. Development of new food products and further optimization regarding storage stability and printing conditions in order to offer the best food products possible 4.\tImprovement of the user interface on your smart device. 5.\tExtension of the offerings on Bocusini.com for your convenience with additional food worlds including designs, recipes, and printing templates  Which stretch goals do we like to realise for you? $ 100,000: In addition to the initial 3 printable food products, we will develop 2 more for your choice The Team behind Bocusini The Bocusini team shares more than 20 years research and development experience related to the nutritional and sensorial characteristics as well as the relevant technical properties of food and food ingredients. The team members have already successfully developed and commercialized several food product innovations and belong to the leading experts in the rapidly emerging area of 3D food printing. \n\n\nThe core Team \n \n\n \n\n\nMeanwhile our team has been strengthened by several specialists in hardware, software and electronics. We have successfully developed the Bocusini 3D food printing system within the last 6 months. \n\n\nMen at work \n \n\n \n\n\nTechnical specifications of the Bocusini 3D Food Printing System Configurations: \n3D food printing retrofit kit (available for Printrbot Simple & Printrbot Maker, Ultimaker 2) \n3D food printing system Bocusini Junior \nOut of the box 3D food printing system Bocusini Pro \nUsable for all flowable food products  \n Volume of food capsules: 60 ml Printing temperature: 20-70 °C (68-158 F) Nozzle size: 0.3-2 mm Working voltage: 110-230 V AC WIFI controlled Open source software & hardware Control by nearly any smart device without software or app installation Working area for available printing systems: Bocusini Junior: 100 x 100 x 130 mm Bocusini Pro: 150 x 150 x 150 mm Product Timeline \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping Costs Shipping for German backers will be 4 €.

In the Press \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you! \n\n\nThanks! \n \n\n \n\n\nBocusini – Das weltweit erste Plug&Play 3D Druck-System für Lebensmittel Kompletter 3D-Drucker für Lebensmittel oder Nachrüst-Druckerkopf für Lebensmittel, Kartuschen mit druckbaren Lebensmitteln, intuitive über WIFI anbundene Nutzerschnittstelle und unterstützende Internetplattform. Über dieses Projekt: Bocusini – Das weltweit erste Plug&Play 3D-Drucker-System Lebensmittel\nBocusini ist ein einfach zu bedienender 3D-Lebensmittel-Drucker für den Einsatz in Gastronomie, Patisserie und zuhause. \n\n\nBocusini für Gastronomie, Patisserie und zuhause \n \n\n \n\n\nEr besteht aus einem beheizbaren Druckkopf, der auf einem Standard 3D-Drucker montiert und über ein intuitives WiFi-fähiges User-Interface angesteuert wird. Die druckfertigen Lebensmittel werden in handlichen Kartuschen angeboten, die rasch eingelegt und wieder ausgewechselt werden können. Über den Online-Marktplatz Bocusini.com erhalten die Nutzer Zugang zu einer Vielzahl von Lebensmitteldesigns, Rezepten und Anleitungen. Wieso haben wir das Projekt Bocusini gestartet? Mit Bocusini wollen wir jedem die faszinierende Welt des Lebensmitteldrucks zugänglich machen. Der Bocusini Drucker kann direkt nach dem Auspacken benutzt werden. Damit ist er wirklich Plug&Play. Das macht ihn zu einem perfekten Werkzeug für kreative Köche und Konditoren, ebenso wie für begeisterte Endverbraucher.  \nDrucker einstecken, per Drag&Drop Lieblingsdesign von der Bocusini-Website einfügen oder das eigene Lebensmitteldesign mit deinem Smart Device umsetzen – ganz ohne vorherige Software-Installation oder Kenntnisse im Lebensmitteldruck – wie unten gezeigt am Beispiel „Märchenprinz“ aus 3D gedruckten Marzipan-Fröschen. \n\n\nGedruckter Marzipan Frosch auf einem Törtchen als \"Froschkönig\" \n \n\n \n\n\nEinfach Lebensmittelkartusche in den Bocusini einsetzen, Druckvorgang starten und schon kannst Du zusehen, wie innerhalb weniger Minuten atemberaubende Lebensmittelkreationen und Bilder geformt werden. Eine gelungene Überraschung für Kunden, Familie, Freunde oder Gäste. Was ist Lebensmittel-Druck? Das Drucken von Lebensmitteln ist keine Zauberei – beim Druckvorgang werden Lebensmittelprodukte wie geschmolzene Schokolade, Kartoffelbrei oder Teige Schicht für Schicht durch eine feine Düse auf einen Teller dosiert – das Prinzip des Lebensmitteldrucks ist damit nichts anderes als ein sehr präziser, automatisch kontrollierter Spritzbeutel. Was ist Bocusini? Mit der Entwicklung von Bocusini wollten wir jedem einen einfachen Zugang in die Welt der Lebensmitteldrucks eröffnen. Um dies zu ermöglichen besteht das System aus vier Bestandteilen: 1. Bocusini Lebensmittel Drucker System mit unserem beheizten 3D Lebensmittel Druckkopf. \n\n\nBocusini Pro \n \n\n \n\n\nNeben dem Bocusini Komplettsystem bieten wir auch ein Nachrüstset aus Druckkopf und User Interface an, das auf verschiedenen 3D Drucker Modellen funktioniert (Bisher auf den Open Source-Modellen Printrbot Simple, Printrbot Maker und Ultimaker 2).  \n\n\nBocusini Retrofit Sets \n \n\n \n\n\n2. Druckfertig gefüllte Bocusini-Lebensmittelkartuschen. Unsere Lebensmittel-Kartuschen sind gebrauchsfertig und für den Druck optimiert – Nutzer können diese aber mit ein bisschen Vorwissen auch selbst befüllen. In unseren Lebensmittelkartuschen verarbeiten wir nur natürliche Lebensmitteln (zudem arbeiten wir aktuell an einem umweltfreundlichen Nachfüll-Konzept). \n\n\nGebrauchsfertige Bocusini Marzipan Kartusche \n \n\n \n\n\nDie Bocusini Kartuschen werden mit einem Füllvolumen von 60ml angeboten. Sie können bis zu 100g eines Lebensmittelproduktes enthalten. Das macht es sehr ergiebig, wie das Beispiel zeigt: \n\n\nBaue bis zu 15 Wolkenkratzer aus Marzipan mit nur einer Kartusche \n \n\n \n\n\n3. Bocusini.com , unsere 3D Lebensmittel Druck Internetplattform führt Euch durch verschiedene Lebensmittelwelten mit druckbaren Lebensmitteldesigns, Rezepten, Anleitungen, Serviervorschlägen und fertige Druckvorlagen mit den notwendigen 3D Druck Dateien und Druckparametern zum Download. \n\n\nBocusini Internetplattform \n \n\n \n\n\n4. Eine intuitive Nutzerschnittstelle zum leichten Erstellen eigener Objekte mit Hilfe von Smart Phones oder Tablets ohne vorherige Software Installation. Für die Version der Kickstarter -Kampagne nutzen wir die Bedienoberfläche von Doodle3D (www.doodle3d.com ) inklusive Software und die WIFI-Steuerung. Wir arbeiten jedoch bereits an der nächsten Generation eines grafischen Open Source User Interfaces, das für den 3D Lebensmittel Druck optimiert wird.\nAlle Teiles des Bocusini Systems (User Interface, Firmware für den Druck), sowie alle Vorlagen werden Open Source sein. Wir wollen Euch damit auch ermutigen, Eure eigenen Vorlagen und druckbare Lebensmitteldesigns zu gestalten. Wie funktioniert Bocusini?\n Mit Bocusini kannst Du Dich ganz auf Deine Kreativität und Deine Freude am Kochen, Backen und Gestalten konzentrieren – und musst Dich nicht mit den technischen Details herumschlagen. Das Drucken der Lebensmittel Druck ist ganz einfach und erfordert nur drei simple Arbeitsschritte: \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n1. Lege eine Lebensmittelkartusche deiner Wahl in den Bocusini-Kopf ein. 2. Gestalte Dein eigenes Design auf Deinem Smart Phone oder Tablet, oder lade eine Druckvorlage von Bocusini.com auf Dein Gerät und wähle die Druckbedingungen für deine Lebensmittelkartusche. 3. Stelle ein Teller unter den Drucker und fang an zu drucken.\nFertig. Nach wenigen Minuten ist Deine individuelle und leckere Lebensmittelkreation gedruckt. Welche Lebensmittel können mit Bocusini gedruckt werden? Wir entwickeln kontinuierlich neue Lebensmittel für den Lebensmitteldruck. Bisher konnten wir mehr als 30 verschiedene Lebensmittelprodukte erfolgreich drucken. Diese kommen aus den verschiedensten Lebensmittelkategorien: Süßwaren (Choci, Marzipan, Kaugummi, Fondant, Gelee), Backwaren (Cookies, Baiser, Biskuits), Snackprodukte (Kartoffel Crisps, herzhafte Snacks), Obst- & Gemüseprodukte (Alle Arten von Fruchtpürees, Fruchtsoßen, Fruchtgelees, oder gelierte Gemüse), Fleischwaren (verschiedene Pasteten und Fleischaufstriche) sowie Milchprodukte (Frischkäse oder Joghurt). Am Anfang werden wir Bocusini-Kartuschen mit Marzipan, Choci und Fondant anbieten und im Laufe der Zeit um weitere Produkte ergänzen. Auf unserem Marktplatz Bocusini (www.bocusini.com ) findet Ihr alle Neuentwicklungen, Gestaltungsideen, Rezepte, Anleitungen und Druckfiles. \nNatürlich ermutigen wir die Lebensmittelenthusiasten unter Euch, ihre eigenen Rezepte zu entwickeln und eigene Kartuschen zu befüllen – dabei werden wir Euch auf Bocusini.com mit Anleitungen und Vorschlägen unterstützen. Damit habt Ihr auch die Möglichkeit, selbst entwickelte und gestaltete Lebensmittelobjekte zu drucken. Wieso brauchen wir Eure Unterstützung, um Bocusini zum Erfolg zu führen?\n Wie bereits erwähnt, lag unsere Motivation für die Entwicklung des Bocusini Systems vor allem darin, den 3D-Lebensmittel-Druck jedem zugänglich zu machen. Um dies zu schaffen, sind noch viele Aufgaben zu bewältigen, für die wir Eure Unterstützung brauchen: 1. Verbesserung des Produktdesigns mit Blick auf Bedienkomfort und einfache Montage. 2. Weiterentwicklung der Lebensmittelkartuschen und Nachfüll-Packungen mit Fokus auf Bedienkomfort und Nachhaltigkeit, sowie Erlangen aller notwendigen Lebensmittelzulassungen. 3. Entwicklung neuer Lebensmittelprodukte und weitere Optimierung hinsichtlich Haltbarkeit und optimale Druckbedingungen. 4.Verbesserung und Erweiterung der Bedienoberfläche für Smart Phones oder Tablets. 5. Erweiterung der Angebote und Inhalte auf Bocusini.com mit zusätzlichen Lebensmittelwelten, Designs, Rezepten und Druckvorlagen. Welche weiteren Ziele würden wir gerne für dich erreichen? € 100,000: Zusätzlich zu den drei anfänglich verfügbaren Lebensmittelprodukten, werden wir zwei weitere Produkte Eurer Wahl entwickeln. Das Team hinter Bocusini Das Bocusini-Team verfügt über mehr als 20 Jahre der Forschungs- und Entwicklungserfahrung in der Lebensmitteltechnologie. Wir haben die physiologischen und sensorischen Charakteristika sowie alle relevanten technischen Eigenschaften von Lebensmitteln und Lebensmittelinhaltsstoffen erforscht und auf Basis dieser Erkenntnisse optimierte Lebensmittelmischungen entwickelt. Mitglieder des Bocusini-Teams haben bereits mehrere Lebensmittelinnovationen erfolgreich in den Markt gebracht und gehören weltweit zu den führenden Experten im Bereich des 3D Lebensmittel-Drucks. \n\n\nDas Kernteam \n \n\n \n\n\nZwischenzeitlich haben wir unser Team durch um Hardware-, Software- und Elektronik-Spezialisten verstärkt. Gemeinsam haben wir haben das Bocusini System in nur 6 Monaten zum heutigen Stand entwickelt. \n\n\nBei der Arbeit. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnische Daten des Bocusini 3D Lebensmittel-Druck Systems Konfigurationen:  - Bocusini 3D Food Printing Nachrüst-Set (aktuell verfügbar für Printrbot Simple & Printrbot Maker und Ultimaker 2) - Bocusini Junior 3D Food Printing System (fertig montiert auf Basis des Printbot Play) - Bocsuini Pro 3D Food Printing (fertig montiert auf Basis des Printbot Simple) \nNutzbar für alle viskosen Lebenmittelprodukte und –pasten \nVolumen der Lebensmittelkartuschen: 60 ml \nDrucktemperatur: 20-70 °C (68-158 F) \nDurchmesser Druckspitze: 0.3-2 mm \nArbeitsspannung: 110-230 V Wechselstrom \nÜber WIFI verbundenes Open Source Software & Hardware Steuerungssystem verbindet sich mit fast jedem Smart Phone oder Tablet (Browser-basiert - erfordert keinerlei Installation von Software oder Apps) \nArbeitsfläche für die verfügbaren Drucker: \n - Bocusini Junior: 100 x 100 x 130 mm - Bocusini Pro: 150 x 150 x 150 mm Zeitplan bis zur Auslieferung der Produkte \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Versandkosten Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschland werden bei 4 € liegen. Für den internationalen Versand ermitteln wir aktuell zu besten Versandkonditionen und teilen diese rechtzeitig vor Ablauf der Kampagne mit. Versandkosten für Sticker-, Skyscraper- und Kartuschen-Rewards werden entsprechend niedriger liegen.  In der Presse: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerzlichen Dank für Eure Unterstützung! Danke ! Danke !  \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Supply chain & logistics\n\nWe have lined up the supply chain for all our components and have derived a schedule with some time buffers. However, due to the number of different suppliers there remains the risk of schedule delays if one of them fails to deliver in time.\n\nEquipment \n\nEspecially regarding the Bocusini printers and the food printing head we are relying on 3rd-party suppliers. Putting these components together and integrating WIFI and custom made firmware may become major challenge that might cause delays.\n\nTimeframe\n\nIt would not be a real Kickstarter project if time is not a risk. We have built several functional prototypes already. The development of the Bocusini hardware, software and web platform is very advanced. We are confident that we have identified all major potential roadblocks and possible issues, but we can’t be entirely sure.\n\nHerausforderungen und Risiken\n\nLieferkette und Logistik\n\nWir haben eine Lieferkette für alle Einzelteile unseres Systems aufgesetzt und einen detaillierten Lieferplan inkl. Zeitpuffer ausgearbeitet. Dennoch lässt sich das Risiko von Verzögerungen angesichts der vielen Lieferanten und der damit verbundenen Abhängigkeiten nicht ganz ausschließen.\n\nGeräte und Bauteile \n\nBesonders bei den Druckerplattformen und bei den Druckköpfen arbeiten wir mit Lieferanten und Technologiepartnern. Mit Printrbot haben wir einen verlässlichen und kompetenten Partner gewonnen. Dennoch können in der Systemintegration und –abstimmung insbesondere im Bereich der Softwareabstimmung größere Herausforderungen liegen, die zu Verzögerungen führen können. \n\nZeitplan\n\nEs wäre wohl kein echtes Kickstarterprojekt, wenn wir uns nicht einen ambitionierten Zeitplan vorgenommen hätten. Wir haben bereits mehrere gut funktionierende Muster gebaut. Auch bei der Entwicklung von Hardware und Software haben wir schon viel erreicht. Daher meinen wir, alle wesentlichen Herausforderungen und Umsetzungsrisiken zu kennen. Die nächsten Schritte haben wir entsprechend durchgeplant. Aber ganz sicher ist man nie.

I'm grateful for your interest in my project :)\n\n“The Riddle of the Sphinx” is a story I made up, loosely based on the Greek mythology of the Sphinx, and more specifically inspired by philosopher Jacques Lacan and oil painter Gustave Moreau’s interpretations of this fantastic female creature. Intrigued by the stories of this image of a wild half-lion-half-woman with wings who asks incredibly difficult to answer riddles and poses a violent threat to mankind, I imagined the narrative of an unfortunately cursed princess who can only speak in query. I related to something deep within this iconic \"wemonster,\" and I hope my new, illustrated storybook will be a gem for all! \n\nI have been working for over a year on this project, and I am so happy to be able share it now. I hope you enjoy my story as I have delighted imagining this into being...! **My most fun challenge** now is to share \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" as widely as possible, and that's where you can help!

    "textDescription": "Story Since its founding in 1993, the Los Angeles Women’s Theatre Festival has successfully dedicated itself to our mission of developing and preserving the art of female solo artistry through year-round multidisciplinary programming that culminates in an exciting Annual Festival that celebrates and honors the achievement of diverse women in theatre. As the oldest solo theatre festival in Los Angeles, a unique aspect of our non-profit arts organization is that we provide a venue for women to develop and cultivate their time-honored craft year-round. \n\n Over the course of the last 23 years, our 4-day, 6 program Annual Festival has presented well over 500 solo performers from around the globe, including performers from Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, The Netherlands, Russia, and India\n and disciplines that include theatre, dance, storytelling, performance poetry, performance art, song, music, and stand-up comedy. LAWTF is committed to reflecting the progressive attitude of Los Angeles by bringing audiences a line up of performers who represent our larger community, and are diverse in age, ethnicity and culture. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAWTF performers have embraced such diverse themes as identity, racism, love, homophobia, folklore, rape, culture, abuse, family, incest, online dating, and the celebration of historical figures. Their voices have transported audiences to laughter, tears and provocative thought by educating, challenging views, promoting acceptance, and inspiring choice in their lives. Many come to realize they are not alone in their validated experiences.\n\n Funding from this Kickstarter Campaign will be used for our 24th Anniversary. LAWTF holds a vital and vibrant place in the history of Los Angeles, solo performance, and women making art. \n\n We have created opportunities for artistic empowerment, autonomy, and social responsibility by offering workshops to develop new works, exposing female artists from around the world to our network of theatre-goers and supporters, and by offering year-round initiatives in which artists participate and give back to the community. We have served at-risk youth, seniors, ex-offender women, low-income artists, homeless, and other disenfranchised communities. \n\n With a strong team and powerful mission at our core, the Los Angeles Women’s Theatre Festival, now institutionalized in the fabric of Los Angeles, will celebrate our 24th Anniversary from March 23 – 26, 2017. We are looking to the future with optimism and clarity as we continue to bring the City of Los Angeles the distinctive art of solo performance excellence, for which we have come to be known. \n\n With the support of our Honorary Chairpersons, Danny Glover and Hattie Winston, along with our many supporters over two decades, we invite you to join us as a donor for our 24th Anniversary Festival!\n\n Risks and challenges 1.If the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival does not reach its goal of $10,000 by January 14th, we will receive nothing from this Kickstarter Campaign.\n\n2.Without the support of the LAWTF community (Board of Directors, Advisory Board, contributors, performers, volunteers and others who are invested), the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival will be challenged to keep its doors open.We, therefore, need our contributors to remain proactive to ensure that the Festival remains alive.\n\n\n3.One potential challenge might be the possibility that either a celebrity, performer, or other professional artist for some reason might have a last minute conflict (i.e illness, film commitment, other booking etc.). In that instance we have an alternate list of performers that we are prepared to contact if the programs are in need of an additional artist.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Daniel: an Ordinary Tragedy is a piece I started to play with in high school actually. I always felt as if I had overwhelming feelings about people and I wondered why- therefore what else to do but write about it right? So I started by writing some scenes of how I'd like things to play out in my head and I started writing a little music to it. I forgot about it until freshman year at college (Long Island University) when I got the opportunity to submit it to be apart of the 2013 Fall semester season as a a workshop directed by David Hugo. Then I submitted it to the Academy for New Musical Theatre \"New Voices\" Showcase as apart of the Stages Festival in Los Angeles where Daniel was picked as a finalist to workshop a small portion of the show. From that point it has been growing and there have been two cabaret's of the piece in New York city- one at The Duplex and one at the West End Lounge.  IN THIS PROJECT- I hope to raise the money to pay musicians and a recording studio to make a demo to send to producers in hopes of putting the show up in a theatre this summer. I can't move forward however without the funds to create the CD and pay musicians... Of course acknowledging that \"times is hard\" and no one has so much \"extra\" but I'm asking for people to support a new dream and a new musical. The very wonderful Maria Porter told me once that \"Art is a verb\" and that is true in a new work that needs to grow and live because theatre is reinvention and I would be so grateful if people out there could help me try to carry on that legacy which has inspired so many of us artists out there.  Peace and Love Paulie Vincent Pecorella  Risks and challenges I suppose my biggest issue with continuing with a new musical is getting people excited enough about a new project that could or could not be reviewed well by the public. If so I make the CD and am unable to find a producer to listen or take me to the next step of putting it on it's feet once again in a more professional setting. New theatre is always a gamble because it is based on taste and we never know how taste will vary within people. I assure you all that I will do everything in my power to reap benefit from this cast recording and give credit to all the backers who have helped me get to the next step. You will all be supremely thanked. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

I have 20 years experience in the glass field, and finally in 2013 I plucked up the courage and set up my own business Partially Obscured www.partiallyobscured.co.uk based in a newly built covered market. From the studio I teach workshops to adults & children, and design and make glass wearables and homewares. \n\n\nPilchuck Glass School \n \n\n \n\n\nI've been given an amazing scholarship opportunity to study new techniques at Pilchuck Glass School, USA. www.pilchuck.com My scholarship comes as a late surprise, so time is limited to raise the remaining funds to cover my travel, remaining fee’s, and materials. Pilchuck for me is Glass Paradise. I will work along-side the most talented and creative glassmakers around the globe. Situated in woodlands, with no distractions, fantastic equipment and an endless supply of passionate glass crafters, you can't help but be inspired. For an artist the opportunity to immerse yourself completely into work, to learn from the greats, to knowledge pool, that's what makes us create. \n\n\nWearable Glass Pins \n \n\n \n\n\nThe course is structured towards creating imagery into glass, with the main learning directed into three processes. From my studies, I will be able to build a new directory of ideas through test pieces, then bring the tests back to the studio, create new works and share my knowledge through glass courses and workshops. \n\n\nCube Series Print \n \n\n \n\n\nMy three main areas of study are: Decals - turning images into heat transfers, to be baked onto glass surfaces, Screen Printing – Applying my images onto screens which I will use to either print with glass enamel or glass powders, and once again, bake onto the glass, and the third technique is Vitreography – A process of engraving glass plate, inking up the plate and running paper prints from the plates. \n\n\nGlass Bunting \n \n\n \n\n\nI hope you can become part of my journey, enabling me to get to the States to complete my scholarship. In return I have set up numerous rewards, they incorporate, small gifts, glass making courses, limited editions and one-off completely bespoke works of glass. Here's a few of my glass workshop testimonials: \"We did the All Day course with Su and it was excellent value. The 3 of us made different things so we learnt more from the experience. Highly recommended. Thank you\" \"I loved it, great fun. Very good teaching\". \"Loved every minute of it....felt like a kid in a sweetie shop, very exciting! Thank you Su, enjoyed your demonstrations & learnt loads\". \"Great fun, thoroughly relaxing with a fab teacher! I will be back!\" \"Wonderful course, highly recommended! Su is a really helpful, friendly and enthusiastic tutor, who encourages you to express yourself through the medium of glass. Great value too. Book your course!\" \n\n\nPebble Slides \n \n\n \n\n\nAfter you have selected your reward, I'll send you an email so you can select your glass colours. Emails will be sent out during October 2015. Thank you for your time in viewing my Kick Starter. x Risks and challenges The main risk is that you are not able to see all the finished products within the rewards. The nature of the kicks starter is for me to learn, experiment then produce new works based on my findings. Therefore your risk is really whether you believe in me? \n\nIf you are giving me photographs to use for the personalised glass products, I will be in touch with the best email/mailing address to send to. We will need to discuss shipping costs and delivery times for both the bowls and sculpture pieces if you live outside the UK. I will need your images 2-4 weeks before you attend a glass making workshop. All workshops will be based at my studio in Brighton, UK unless previously arranged.

This is an over-sized special edition (normally I&A issues are comic book size and roughly 56 pages) with an issue theme focusing on the neo-victorian, dieselpunk, steampunk, and gaslight fantasy genres. We want to be able to offer the actual purchase of the issue and the previous two issues (with alternative covers) through this project as pledge rewards, this way ensuring that if the project funds everyone who purchased an issue will be guaranteed their copy and if it doesn't fund then no one is out their investment. The funding will also make it possible to provide additional issues to sell at upcoming conventions as well as making sure everyone in the issue gets a copy and is able to wholesale purchase their own issues for resale if they wish.  The money raised through this project will go directly towards bulk printing of the issue and the shipping costs of getting the pledge rewards to their backers. The pledge rewards are all focused towards offering Insects & Angels issues and related artwork/items so the magazine is basically supporting itself. We've put our project goal low enough to accommodate printing the issues it will take to cover the people who've signed up to get the new issue when it becomes available that we know for sure wish to purchase it. Even after we (hopefully) reach this goal we'll continue to promote the project so anyone who wants the issue can get it when we're assured we'll have the cost of printing covered.  You can find more about Insects and Angels at: http://insectsandangels.com   --This issue: http://insectsandangels.com/magazine/003/ --Or join us on our facebook page: http://facebook.com/InsectsAngels Below are some samples from the issue. We'll be adding different samples and such to the updates throughout the month... Our cover artist is the wonderful Kazuhiko Nakamura , who is also one of the featured/interviewed issue artists. Featured artist samples... Collaboration with the Boheme Tribal Belly Dance Troupe: We photographed the troupe posed and performing to create two different sets of original artwork for this issue... Collaboration with photographer Lex Machina: Bethany Grenier outfitted and styled our two lovely models Holly and Erika for a series of photographs that were given an artistic treatment for the issue. There are a variety of portraits, these are samples of two: The assistant editor for the issue Bethany Grenier is a novelist and also has an incredible collection of her own designs -a variety of extravagant outfits and everyday wear -as she is one of those people in the steampunk world who dresses the part daily. We put together a variety of her designs for the issue... More previews to come... The original covers for issues one and two. The previous issues pledged through this project will come with alternative covers (unless you'd like the originals, we're pretty easy going ;) * Credits: The music used in the video is Gloomy Sunday performed by Paul Whiteman with Johnny Hauser (released under Creative Commons and can be found on Archive.org ).

Our project, our goals We are two musicians/composers from Italy. We write progressive rock music (symphonic prog) that draws inspiration from famous literary texts. We recently completed one album based on Part One of The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot. The album is titled \"The Burial\" and is available on major US Digital Stores. Our work encountered great success and was praised for its musical and artistic value. The album is available for digital download but, as you can imagine, we need to get to record labels if we want this project to grow. If you like, you can learn more about us at www.banaau.com or through our Facebook Page . Why we are asking for your support At the moment our aim is to get to FIM (International Music Exhibition) which is a place where independent artists can bring their ideas and get in touch with record labels. We already reserved our slot there and wil be performing \"The Burial\" on 11th September 2016. At the same time, we will have the occasion to present our work to record labels there to find a label that would produce our next work (we have two more musical projects, one based on poems by E.A. Poe and another one based on tragedies by Shakespeare. The slot at FIM has its own cost, and we also need resources to pay the musicians and for rehearsal rooms . We are really close to taking a big leap forward and your help can be decisive! \n\n\nBanaau at FIM 2016 \n \n\n \n\n\nThat's interesting... but what do Banaau sound like? ...Here are a couple of clips for you to listen to.

Well, we do hope this will not be the case. But... If things go wrong, that means we'll have to rely on our own resources. This is too an important step and we cannot miss it. If we do it together, we'll do it better and can have greater chance of success!

To do that, you'll be crafting items to send heroes on quests, earning treasure, and upgrading your guild with new specialists and rooms. Each turn you get to take one action – gathering resources, crafting items for heroes, or purchasing upgrades for your guild. Gathering Resources There are four main resources – cloth, leather, metal, and wood. On your turn, you can gather three resources of the same type, or two resources of any kind. Resources are limited and so is your storage space, so you'll need to plan ahead to use them wisely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the proper upgrades, you can also access gems and magic – special, higher quality resources that allow you to craft jeweled or enchanted items. \nCrafting Items To craft an item for a hero, you spend the resources indicated on a quest card, and then gain coins for the item you crafted. Once a hero is equipped, they go on a quest, bringing back treasure and joining your guild. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome heroes need two items to go on their quest. If you're the first to craft an item, you earn coins right away, but don't get treasure until the second item is crafted. You get to place your guild mini on the quest, which means the hero will join your guild when the quest is completed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading Your Guild When you upgrade your guild, you pay coins to hire a specialist, build a new room, or both. Specialists are each unique, but only a few are available at a time, while the rooms are all available from the start of the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have limited room for specialists above your guild, and rooms must be placed adjacent to your existing guild structure. You can earn bonus resources or coins when you cover up certain areas of your player board with a room. \n\nEnding the Game When the Council of the Wise arrives in Greycastle, each player gets a final turn and may make an offering to the council. Players reveal their treasures and score prestige for everything they've accomplished. The guild with the most prestige earns the title of The King's Guild and their leader takes the throne!

[...] a very clean and well executed design.\" Geek Dad Preview by Jonathan Liu \"I found myself really enjoying the theme [...] it was fun to think about outfitting heroes for their quest and being a regular person in a fantasy world instead of one of its heroes.\" Moe's Game Table Preview by Maurice Fitzgerald \"The game’s simplicity belies its deceptive but substantial depth that doesn’t reveal itself at first glance. It is a very easy game to pick up, and the shifting setup and asymmetric player powers means more time exploring than learning.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is US , Canada , and EU friendly!

We already have extensive and detailed quotes from several manufacturers, and will be making sure The King's Guild is produced with quality components and great design.\n\nWhen it comes to shipping, we've already begun discussions with potential shipping partners in each territory we ship from, and will use the most effective method for each region to deliver games quickly and in good condition.\n\nWe're 100% dedicated to making The King's Guild a phenomenal game, and are always available if you have any questions or suggestions for us.

    "hasHeaderVideo": false,
    "videoLength": 0,
    "descriptionMediaNumber": 0,
    "textLength": 5953,
    "textDescription": "Story Genre: Traditional Fantasy Fiction (medievalist, sword & sorcery)  Setting: Uhratt is a land that has little memory. The realms are ruled by great city-states that were built upon the remnants of largely forgotten civilizations. Legends tell of time when heroes, once mortal, were raised to godhood, of the few who remain, and of a great cataclysm that struck down both the divine and mundane alike. Into this world, continuing to find itself, Bengallen is born and raised to man. He will face difficult choices and be called upon to perform deeds that cause even the gods themselves to shudder. He will know pain. He will be cast down. The question before him is not whether to rise, but how.  This first story follows a man named Bengallen as he emerges from the ashes of an old life, unsure of what to do with his new one. In many ways Bengallen wants to restore, reclaim, or revenge aspects of his old life, but he is presented with a place and people that have a real need of him then and there. They need him largely for the skills he learned in his old life, but can he ever have that life again? Concept and Subtext: It is a story of synthesis, learning to incorporate what was, is, and could be into something that is useful and meaningful on its own. While the story takes place in a decidedly fantasy setting of medieval flavor, it is a human story based not only on my own personal struggles, but the struggles of others to which I have humbly bore witness.  While I am academically trained as a philosopher (BA) and minister (MDiv), I have also served as an Army infantryman and a special operations soldier, a chaplain to both current service members and veterans (from WWII to Afghanistan), a church pastor and chaplain to civilians as well, and have formed intimate bonds of friendships with many others along the way. These experiences, some of which I do hope and plan to write about more literally later, all inform the character drama that plays out over the course of this first book as well as all the ones I have mapped out for the series. Personal identity formation is just the beginning. I have incorporated my encounters with group dynamics, traumatic stress, recovery, morality, wisdom, destiny, faith, fear, emotional grief, physical pain, and all subjects between into how these characters think, feel, and act in their world. Vision: The series I have mapped out would consist of 10 books and would be 3 cycles of 3 books each with a final 10th book wrapping it all up. I have a strong commitment to writing each book as a full and complete narrative in and of itself. I hate it (even though many great authors do it) when I get to the ending of a book and it just stops, mid-whatever, like the author just got tired of writing or hit his page goal. Each of my books will tell an independent story. Each cycle will have an over-arching story. The three cycles will utilize the same universe and characters, but time will have passed between them and they will each address a new over-arching plot. There will be connections between the first and last book, however, if you think of the first 3 books as an origin cycle, the next 3 as a legends cycle, the last 3 as an epic cycle, and the final novel as the ultimate revelation of certain destinies. Work on all 10 novels remains ongoing, but there is a transition of focus from the first novel to the second one occurring. At the close of this Kickstarter (and reward fulfillment) I suspect that transition to complete. That means that the second novel will be my priority by August 2013 and should enter its own editing phase by December 2014, with a subsequent Kickstarter, for the second book, in early 2015, baring other publishing options which may avail themselves. Intent: While, yes, I do want to make some money from my work, potentially be published mainstream, gain some prestige and all that, I am far more interested in ensuring that people read and enjoy my narrative. I believe that I really have something people will enjoy here. I have enjoyed writing and planning them and it is time to start sharing them with the world.  Kickstarter allows me the freedom to not only distribute the novel to you, my backers/fans/readers/supporters, at no out of pocket cost, but also to generate additional copies and improve the quality of the copies with minimal personal expense. I simply do not have the financial freedom to drop $5000 to print up something I don't know I can sell. With this Kickstarter, however, you get the novel, I get to get it to you, I use the funding for start up costs and additional inventory, and my regular paycheck isn't prevented from doing all the things I need it to do. Everyone wins!  Risks and challenges The draft of the novel at the Kickstarter launch stands at 140,000 words (or roughly 420 paperback novel pages) and is with a couple of editors. Through the month of April, I will be implementing their feedback to refine the novel. Thus, I do not foresee any problems in providing rewards or moving forward in promoting it. If for some reason it is not as \"polished\" as I like by May, I will still print and send the best draft in the format detailed in your rewards and can still submit for copyright registration, ISBN, and LCCNs. \n\nAny funds in addition to those used to fulfill rewards, will be put to the following purposes:\n\nRegistering a copyright.\nAcquiring ISBN & LCCN identification numbers.\nPrint on demand initial expenses and other start up costs.\nSending courtesy copies to various publishers, reviewers, and critics.\nMonetary gift to my editor. \nMonetary gift to my artists.\nIncreasing the \"aesthetic quality\" of reward copies (better covers, paper types, etc).\nOff-set the cost of printing additional copies of the book.\nDistribution and promotion of the novel and the series.

    "videoLength": 148,
    "descriptionMediaNumber": 6,
    "textLength": 9707,
    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen going somewhere dangerous, take a human.  Humans are tough. Humans can last days without food. Humans heal so quickly, they pierce holes in themselves or inject ink under their epidermis for fun. Humans will walk for days on broken bones in order to make it to safety. Humans will literally cut off bits of themselves if trapped by a disaster.  You would be amazed what humans will do to survive. Or to ensure the survival of others they feel responsible for.  That's the other thing. Humans pack-bond, and they spill their pack-bonding instincts everywhere. Sure it's weird when they talk sympathetically to broken spaceships or try to pet every lifeform that scans as non-toxic. It's even a little weird that just existing in the same place as them for long enough seems to make them care about you.  But if you're hurt, if you're trapped, if you need someone to fetch help? You really want a human.   (Thanks to Tumblr user iztarshi for the idea and the above copy. Used with permission) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend toward dystopian science fiction, a trend that has made it appear that many authors think that humans are the worst thing that could ever happen to a planet or a civilization. Although this may turn out to be the case, isn’t it a little depressing? In many science fiction scenarios, humans are depicted as weak meat bags that can barely carry their own weight, much less help with the mission. We are looked upon as parasitic, pitiful, and generally only useful in our numbers. But does that always have to be the case? Science fiction gives us answers to the questions that start with “What If?” In the case of Humans Wanted, the questions rise as “what if humans could contribute something to the universe?” “What if humans were useful?” “What if humans were awesome?” This anthology allows us to tell stories about what it means to be a human in a universe that might not actually hate us. Many science fiction stories show humans in a bad light, and it’s true, some days we seriously suck. However, one of the things that’s great about fiction, and science fiction in particular, is that we can show not only how we are, but also how we can be. What if we didn’t suck in the future? What if we found a place where we could contribute and help and generally kick butt?  These are the stories I want to fund. I want hope and promise and yeah, even sucky situations, but ones where our species contributes, rather than destroys.  If funded, Jody Lynn Nye and Keith R.A. DeCandido will be providing stories for the anthology. Jody Lynn Nye lists her main career activity as ‘spoiling cats.’ When not engaged upon this worthy occupation, she writes fantasy and science fiction books and short stories. Since 1987 she has published over 40 books and more than 120 short stories . Over the last twenty or so years, Jody has taught in numerous writing workshops and participated on hundreds of panels covering the subjects of writing and being published at science-fiction conventions. She has also spoken in schools and libraries around the north and northwest suburbs. In 2007 she taught fantasy writing at Columbia College Chicago. She also runs the two-day writers workshop at DragonCon. Jody lives in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, with her husband Bill Fawcett, a writer, game designer, military historian and book packager, and a black cat, Jeremy. Keith R.A. DeCandido is the author of an absurd amount of fiction, both tie-ins (in the worlds of Star Trek, Marvel Comics, Stargate SG-1, The X-Files, Sleepy Hollow, Supernatural, Doctor Who, Aliens, and tons and tons more) and original fiction (the \"Precinct\" series of fantasy police procedurals; urban fantasy stories set in Key West featuring Cassie Zukav, weirdness magnet; stories of the Super City Police Department; urban fantasy novels about a nice Jewish boy from the Bronx who hunts monsters, and much more). He also writes about classic TV shows for Tor.com , plays percussion for the parody band Boogie Knights, edits prose for clients both corporate and private, trains and teaches karate (he achieved his second-degree black belt in 2013), and probably some other stuff that he can't remember due to the lack of sleep. Find out less at DeCandido.net . The rest of the stories will be selected through an open submissions process. Anyone is welcome to submit as long as they follow the following guidelines (more detailed submissions guidelines will be posted once the project is funded both here as well as other sites for calls for anthologies are accepted): Science Fiction only (no Fantasy, Steampunk or Horror, although horror elements may be present in the story). The stories will each be between 3000-6000 words. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen not fighting crime or tinkering with Tarot spreads, Vivian Caethe writes weird fiction, science fiction, fantasy, quirky nonfiction and everything in between. Previously of WordFire Press, where she studied under David Farland and Kevin J. Anderson, she now freelances to give herself more time for the projects she holds dearest to her heart. She has an MFA in Creative Writing from Regis University and is a member of the Editorial Freelancer’s Association. She also drinks copious amounts of tea. While doing all these things, she lives in Colorado with her husband, their dog who thinks he’s a werehuman, and a super genius cat. She can be found as a writer at www.viviancaethe.com and as an editor at www.viviantrask.com   \n\n\n\n\n\nThis Kickstarter will be used to fund production and publication of the anthology. Basically what that means is you’re helping fund paying the person who came up with the idea, the authors, the editor, the cover artist, the interior designer, and making it possible to print and ship copies to you and yours as well as pay for the Kickstarter fees and Backerkit service.  \n\n\n\n\n\n$5 - Stargazer - This reward gains you our gratitude for being willing to help us make this project a reality. Your name will appear in the book with our thanks. $10 - Explorer - With this level, you will receive an eBook copy of the book along with your name in the book. $25 - Soldier - Here you get a print copy of the book plus the ebook as well as your name in the book. $50 - Colonist - At this level, you will receive two print copies of the book and one copy of the ebook as well as your name in the book.  $100 - Specialist - By pledging at this level, you will receive a print copy special edition novelette written by the editor for the theme, plus a copy of the book plus the ebook as well as your name in the book. $1000 Conqueror - If pledging at this level, you will receive a novel edit from the editor of the anthology plus the novelette, a copy of the book, and the ebook. Your name will also appear in the book with an extra-special thank you.  \n\n\n\n\n\nKickstarter launch June 2016  Kickstarter end July 2016  Call for Submissions August 2016  Call for Submissions ends December 1, 2016  Slush pile read and stories selected February 2017  Acceptances and Contracts sent to authors February 2017  Stories edited April 2017  Book proofed, Cover Completed, and Book Sent to printer May 2017  Books shipped to backers July 2017\n Video Music “A Million Worlds” by Andrew Odd Video template by iMovie.  Cover Painting by Fotokostic Art Design by Owl Quest Creative Risks and challenges With any publishing project, there are always pitfalls and speed bumps and this project no doubt will have some of its own. However, with four years in the publishing industry, I have seen many of them and am working to avoid the ones I am aware of. \n\nWith any project that has as many moving parts as this one I anticipate there being some challenges that will crop up. The parts that I refer to are the authors, the cover artist, the layout designer, and myself. With my previous projects, there were only two people involved. In this project I have to involve more people to make this project come together (either through paying them for their stories or hiring them to make the book look good). However, I have worked with the person who has agreed to be the cover artist before as well as the layout designer and we have successfully made several of my books look professional. \n\nSince I plan to use on-demand publishing for this project, I will be using Createspace. This print-on-demand company is owned by Amazon and poses only a minimal obstacle to the production process. The challenges I foresee with this company are merely issues with layout and formatting that can be addressed through their online review process and by printing proof copies of the book. Every once in a while Createspace also misprints a book, so I will be checking all of the books to make sure they look the way they are supposed to.\n\nAnother risk is that I am in the process of completing my other Kickstarter project: The Writer’s Block Tarot. However, with the submissions process being what it is, I foresee very few problems with overlap as submissions are schedule to be closed after the production part of the previous Kickstarter is completed (leaving only the fulfillment). Additionally, I feel my previous experience with a successfully funded Kickstarter can only be a benefit to this one, as I am more familiar with the process and the interfaces. This previous experience has also allowed me to know what to expect (to some extent) from the fundraising process.\n\nFinally, a common risk to Kickstarters is the number of backers involved. We will be using Backerkit to make sure no one gets overlooked in the process. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

They are all radical American women from the turn of the century, who will be celebrated in this series of iconographic portraits. Researching this project has been fascinating and challenging work. Twelve is a substantial number of paintings to execute, but a very small selection of the courageous women who helped to shape our country and the world. Women have always been pivotal in the history of the world, but their stories are often untold or told badly. Let's put faces to some of these pioneering women, and restore them to living consciousness! Project details.   The portraits will be in oil on cradled oak panels (approximately 1' x 2'), with gold leafing. They will be completed over a period of three months, framed and exhibited at an art show locally by the end of the year. I have nearly completed the first icon in order to have something to share on this page, and to get clear about just what I am getting myself into. My evolving process is a combination of classical and contemporary techniques, and I think the icons will look pretty sharp! \n\n\nNellie Bly Icon \n \n\n \n\nA website will be maintained for the duration of the project, detailing progress on the project (with pictures of course), providing biographical information on the subjects, with quotes and trivia, and giving contributors an opportunity to comment and share ideas as the work progresses: [www.whoisnelliebly.com] Donations will be used for materials (primary cost), incentives (yours to keep!), promotional (posters, invites, towards the art opening etc..), and research (This cost is nominal. Most of my research is done online or at the library, but I can imagine the need to purchase a more unusual book for example). What's in it for you? Importantly you have the opportunity to support meaningful works of art and engage in the dialogue of constructing our history and examining our cultural symbols. Everyone who contributes will receive an invitation to the art opening, and have the opportunity to check in on the project at the project website [www.whoisnelliebly.com ]. Contributors also have the opportunity to gain materially through investment in original artwork! Concluding.  My sincerest thanks for your taking the time to check out my page. If you believe that this is a worthwhile project and something that you would like to see happen, please make a donation! Every pledge, great or small, helps to make this dream a reality. Special thanks to my mother for being a strong and successful woman. And Most special thanks to my daughter Claire for inspiring me with her bright and curious mind to create meaningful works of art.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two exorcists of LionHeart Kingdom\nwere seeing to their daily chores when there was a knock at their\ndoor. The exorcists were given a letter, by the King himself,\nrequesting them to go to a far away village within his dominion. It\nhad been quite some time since the royal exorcists had performed any\nparanormal duties. No spirits dared bother the inhabitants of the\nLionHeart Kingdom. The case was also intriguing as usually a report\nof spirits coming from a small, underpopulated village would be\nassumed to be the imaginations of superstitious commoners. \n\nUpon arriving at the village the\nexorcists found the village to be quite quaint and friendly. The feeling of camaraderie was confounding as the reason the exorcists have been brought here was\ndue to a report of murder. According to the letter a specter had\nappeared before one of the villagers and killed him in cold blood. It\nhas been six days since the murder and all of the villagers seem very\nkeen to see the spirit exorcised. Despite how helpful the villagers\nare something still seems amiss. \n\nIt is up to you to find out the truth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis\ngame is a top-down, adventure RPG. Usually detective games are\npresented as point and click adventure games. I personally have never\nbeen a fan of point and clicks, I usually get frustrated by the\nsystem. \n\nIn\npoint and clicks I always mistake objects I can interact with for\nobjects that are just art in the background. I find this incredibly\naggravating and usually find myself clicking all over the screen. So\nof course when I decided to make a detective game I chose to do away\nwith the point and click controls you usually see in this type of\ngame. It makes much more sense in my eyes to present this kind of\ngame from a top-down RPG perspective. It is quite usual for\nadventurers to explore every tunnel in a cave and examine all the\npots in a town.In case my explanation is confusing let me\ngive you a screenshot of my game in development. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain\ndon't let me confuse you when I call this game a RPG. I mean it in\nthe same vein that Harvest Moon is a RPG. There won't be any random\nbattles with monsters or anything. The focus of this game is to solve\na crime. Not grind experience and gold for hours. Though that sounds\nlike a great idea for a sequel. This game's focus is on talking to\nwitnesses and suspects, looking for clues, and trying to discover the\ntruth. \n\nThis\ngame is being programmed with Flash Developer and will be a free game\navailable to everyone upon release. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nfind myself split between the creative need to program games and the\nsimple urge to excel in competitive gaming. I'm a programmer,\nproducer, designer and publicist for Berathen Games.\nWhile also managing my social life I somehow find the time to study\nprogramming and game design. I'm a new indie game developer with a\ncouple projects under my belt. \n\nI\nconsider myself to be incredibly optimistic, lethargic, and quite\nanalytic. While my previous projects are efforts to learn how to use\nthe tools around me, this project will be displaying what I find\ninteresting about RPG games. It's all about being submerged inside\nthe game's world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBerathen\nis a group of simply two guys, and this is our most ambitious title\nto date! We would love your help and support so that we can do what\nwe enjoy MOST - being creative. \nYou\ncan leave the development pains, hours upon hours fixing game bugs,\nand eating nothing but nachos to us! \nWe\nplan to use this money for higher quality resources. As myself and my\npartner are terrible artists I'm sure in the end you will thank us\nfor not drawing anything for you. \nAnything\nextra you give us, not that you have to, will go into porting this\ngame to the iPhone and other mobile devices. \n\nThank\nyou! I am incredibly passionate about games and does my heart good to\njust think you've read everything here and are interested in my game.\nThank you.

Our goal with this short, is to dive deeper into what being a young hobby photographer in Britain is like and show you what is behind our drive and ambition along the way. \n\n\nRon Timehin \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTobi Shinobi \n \n\n \n\n\nWith your help, our ideas can easily become reality. We have some amazing locations, stories, interviews with other Instagramers and exciting run and gun action scenes planned out that we can't wait to shoot and show you guys. All of that thrown in with some beautiful cinematic sequences of the sun rise over Snowdonia National Park - Wales and the sun set over Lands End - Cornwall and even maybe some laughs along the way! If you haven't seen already, Ron & Tobi's photography speaks for itself. You can check Ron out on Tumblr here  and his work on Instagram here . Check Tobi's Insta out here as well.  \n\n\nRon Timehin \n \n\n \n\n\n Now to the details. \nWe plan to rent a minivan, take a small crew and spend a solid week traveling the UK. The money pledged will go towards equipment and car hire,  food and accommodation and small tokens of gratitude to the people who are letting us stay in their houses and invade their lives for a few nights a long the way. Plus all your great rewards! \nDuring our trip we plan on visiting 3 beautiful landscape locations, two major cities and as many abandoned and run down warehouses, houses and hospitals as we can find along the way. \n \n\n\n\nRon Timehin \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTobi Shinobi \n \n\n \n\n\n       All suggestions will be considered and extra credit will go out to the person with the best ideas for new locations :) \n Risks and challenges Both Ron and I are currently third and final year university undergraduates. With the current work load, this project is about as fun as it will get for us in the next few months. It's a passion project, we aren't doing this for any financial gains so expect this to take a little longer for us to get round to confirming screening dates and locations. \n\nAll that said though, we will focus completely on this as soon as we graduate. We deliberately put the reward delivery dates and screening dates a solid two months after our final deadlines, so don't expect much of a delay if one does occur!

But it’s that quality time that all educators say is necessary to foster smart, compassionate kids, who will become responsible, thoughtful, and successful adults.  And once you find that time, how do you make it meaningful?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if there was an easy and FUN way for you to build character and share values with your kids? That’s what Happy Heart Kid is all about. Our team of educators and professionals have created fun character-building activity kits for parents to play and engage with their children. \n\nEverything you need is included in the box-- all you need to do is open, play, discover, and learn! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's in each Activity Kit ? Our team has defined four components for each kit that cater to the different cognitive learning styles: auditory, visual, and kinesthetic.  Each component progressively deepens the understanding of the character trait for that box:  \n\nActivity Book -- a coloring workbook to introduce the trait, as well as Caleb and his learning adventures \n\nCreate & Explore -- an engaging craft activity that parents can use to prompt meaningful discussions \n\nImaginative Play -- games and role-playing that spark self-expression, originality, and creativity \n\nConnect & Share -- a fun hands-on project to promote further exploration of the trait and encourage real-life application  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to explicitly teaching the character theme of each box, Happy Heart Kid kits also develop literacy, fine-motor skills, and critical thinking abilities with every activity. But most of all, each kit is packed with creativity, fun, and play so your kids will be excited to discover and explore what's inside!  Our Star Meet Caleb! \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhy Happy Heart Kid? \nYou want your child to play with a Happy Heart Kid activity kit because as important as math and reading skills are, there's so much more to kids than that.  In fact, research shows that strong character skills better prepare children for academic success.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter education is not just a 'nice-to-have;' it's a set of critical developmental skills needed to help our children grow into well-rounded, global citizens.  More and more experts are recognizing that character can actually be taught, and are putting increasing emphasis on early-childhood education to do just that.  Currently there are a lot of research articles and books explaining these conclusions, but what is lacking are the hands-on activities that parents can use with their children to help build character through everyday play.  Our fast-paced, schedule-packed and hyper-competitive world makes it almost impossible for us to slow down and nurture these skills in a proactive and joyful way. \n \n\n\n\nWe wanted to make it easy for all families to engage in activities that make learning character skills interactive and effective, and use playtime to create fun, teachable moments. Our idea was to combine the good character values of Sesame Street with the hands-on learning of Montessori education.   \n\n\n\n\nOur Journey \n \nArchana is a former financial analyst, and has spent time volunteering with children in New York City, as well as in India.  Martha studied Studio Arts at Mount Holyoke College, and worked in education with an NGO in Colombia. \nMartha and I met when we were volunteering our time at a neighborhood children's class. We were working with young kids and planning lessons and activities around universal values such as patience, kindness, manners, team work, and more.  As we built relationships with these families, we realized that busy parents were constantly seeking tools to teach these same traits to their kids, and weave meaningful conversations into their everyday lives.  We all tend use situations when we observe bad behavior to react and talk to kids, but what if we made playtime a way to proactively get our kids to start thinking, practicing and talking about their character?  This is what we set out to do.  \n\nWe have spent the last year researching and talking to parents, kids, educators, and child development psychologists about making playtime a means to nurturing empathy, kindness, curiosity, and perseverance for future generations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimonials  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nRewards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's Next \nWe have already received tremendous help to create our Empathy and Manners kits, and get us to this stage.  Now with your help, we hope to be able to go into production so that many more families can enjoy these products.   \nHowever, this Kickstarter campaign is just the first step in getting Happy Heart Kid off the ground.  We want to expand our line beyond our first two kits, and continue developing games, crafts, and books to teach additional character traits.  We hope to grow a community of parents, kids, educators, and caregivers that join us in our mission of making playtime not just fun, but purposeful for our kids to build a better future.  \nGratitude \nHappy Heart Kid has been an incredible journey for me. I want to just conclude by saying  this wouldn't have happened without the help and support of some amazing people I met that helped bring our project to life.  \n\nI want to express my gratitude to our amazing illustrator Kim Batti , our designer Nicole Corea  and our photographer and Instagram guru Laily Mesbah . Special thanks to our amazing Montessorians; Mona Kiani and Shloka Shroff, who made our product so much better. \n \n\nAnd to Martha and Rachael, who generously spent hundreds of hours toiling with me.  I am forever in your debt and blessed to have met both of you.  \n\n\nWhatever the outcome, I am grateful for this experience.  We truly hope our product isn't just a toy company; but is of service to families everywhere.  \n Risks and challenges Our main challenge could be getting the rewards to our campaign supporters according to schedule. Because we are a small team and all of our kits are produced and packed by hand, there may be delays in shipping these out. But we have plans underway to make sure we make our deadlines, and we will have extra hands on deck to make this happen. We commit to communicate with you to keep you informed and updated on the status of your Happy Heart Kid kit. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Any tour budget requires a kind of discipline that we are often incapable of sustaining, and while we would never use kickstarter funding to buy alcohol, here are some examples of extraneous expenses that you could indulge us in:\n\n$5. Buy Billy a coffee, an expensive one!\n$20. Take Laura on a vintage store shopping spree, a cheap one.\n$40. Buy Ry a couple of sets of guitar strings.\n$50. Mobile data roaming plan, it ain't sexy but it's gonna happen.\n$250. There will be at least one night out there with no accommodation budget and that would cover a hotel, which saves us from selling Jefferson.\n$60,000.

The playtime is about 30 minutes/player.   \n\nNote: The components are subject to change in the final product (graphics on cards, layout, icons). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n                                                                        \n\n                                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The rulebooks are subject to change in the final product. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game components are language independent, the rulebook will be included in 4 languages: English, French, German and Hungarian,   Additional downloadable rules: Italian,\nDutch,\nSpanish \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest versions are available on our homepage: http://a-games.hu/en/download/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping is a great challenge in all kickstarter projects. The product should arrive on time, in mint condition and without exorbitant shipping costs. We decided to use Happyshops and Ship Naked fulfillment services. The shipping cost will be added automatically to your pledge amount based on your location (FREE to US and Zone 1) . Our campaign is EU and US friendly, it is guaranteed that you will not be charged with any additional fees on your pledge amount. We are shipping from within these regions. For other regions in some cases you may expect additional customs charges depending on your local regulations, but we and our experienced fulfillment partners will make sure to keep these fees as low as possible. We set the estimated delivery to September, but this is the worst case scenario. You will probably get your game sooner. AVE ROMA - EXTENDED PACK: With the AVE ROMA - EXTENDED PACK you can buy a pack of 3 games (AVE ROMA - PREMIUM, Dudab and Piñata Party). For a special price (well below the retail prices) we have a certain quantity of our previous games to offer. We didn’t create a separate pledge level for the “ESSEN PICKUP” - EXTENDED PACK due to the limited availability of these games. If you would like to pick up your EXTENDED PACK in Essen, please select Hungary as your shipping location in your pledge. We will send out a survey after the campaign and there you will be able to specify an Essen pick up. \n\nFREE Essen pickup: As we will have a booth this year too during the Essen Spiel we offer you to come to our booth and pick up your games personally. For the Essen pickups the ordered game quantity is unlimited. The summarized shipping prices: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple orders : In order to offer the best possible deal, there is also a chance to add more games to you pledge. Buy more and lower your cost per game! For your pledge you get your second and further copies on discounted price with no additional shipping cost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetailers will get the games the same time as any other backers , before the official release. If you're a retailer, please contact us at info@a-games.hu during the campaign for a private conversation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game is the first in our complex game series line. This game has been in the making since 2012, when the very first prototype was built. Since then the game went through many iterations and continuous balancing with hundreds of playtests. We are now ready to present it to you on Kickstarter! Please support us and let's make this dream come true together! :) \n\nWe release games with great value. This is our first kickstarter campaign, but definetly not our first venture into board game publishing. During the past two years we gathered valuable experience by successfully publishing two of our own games for international release, as well as several localized versions of other games from various publishers. We now understand all the processes and challenges of bringing a game to the market. We started small, released a card game and a bigger box game after that. With Dudab and Piñata Party we had the opportunity to learn all the important aspects of board game publishing. Now we are confident to deliver this beautiful and exciting game to you on time, in amazing quality. \n\nSome add-ons / expansions will be available after the campaign too, but only for an extra charge. The expansion modules will be priced at €5-€10 each after the campaign ends. Not to mention the ones that are only available as part of the Kickstarter campaign. Make sure not to miss out on them! \n\nIf you back us here on Kickstarter you will get the game sooner. The international distribution is a complex process so we cannot be sure when and where you will be able to buy the game through retailers. You will surely be able to buy the game during the next Spiel in Essen, but the PREMIUM edition will only be available during this campaign. You can only buy the RETAIL version later and maybe buy some add-ons for extra money. The production will start shortly after the end of the campaign, to make sure we can start sending out the games to you in August-September. \n\nThis game has been thoroughly tested, and the work is going on until the launch of production. We are confident that the gameplay is balanced and smooth. Our core playtesters are hardcore gamers with long years of experience. Last year in Essen we received very good feedback from international testers too, and the game only got better since then. A previous P&P version is available until the end of the campaign. It is different in  details from the current version, but gives you a general feel on the core mechanics of the game. \n You can download the previous P&P files for rules v0.94 through the following link:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bx3smKeGLowTSU1SWTZNV3JLcFU&usp=sharing Our timeline for the production: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Some components have changed since the reviews were made. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Its a keen and clever twist on standard worker placement.\"\"Just the right amount of brainburn.\"\"It was constantly fun, non-stop.\" Rahdo's Final Thoughts \n\n\nFinal Thoughts - Update \n\n\nGameplay Runthrough Extended gameplay JPlay – Markus Weihrauch\n\n \"I really enjoyed it...

We've spent more than 3 years developing and playtesting the game. Most of the preparations are done and the next steps are planned in details. During the campaign all the graphics and minor fixes will be finalized.\n\nWe have a manufacturing partner locally so we already have the processes laid out and we know we will have high quality components. The manufacturer is ready for our order as soon as we are. Shortly after the campaign ends the game will be in production.\n\nThe fullfillment will be done through Happyshops and Ship Naked. For the freight shipping we will use our usual partner Nagel. Since the manufacturing is done locally, there is no extra waiting time for the games to arrive for distribution. When the production ends we can send out the products to our fulfillment partners immediately.\n\nWe will keep you updated with all the relevant information about the progress of the project. \nWe would like to give you the best possible product and support. :) Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

To our loyal fans, we apologize for teasing you with the idea of new music for such a long time. Now, the time has come for us to make a new record that is so good that you will have no choice but to forgive us! No Band is an Island We have decided to record 6 brand new songs with producer Steve Wilson [Hawk Nelson, Children 18:3, Leeland] this time around. Not only do we want you to play a part in making this new album, but it is simply impossible for us to do it without you! By backing this project you will receive some super-fantastical rewards AND be a part of permanently shaping our future as a band.  Your pledges will go directly toward every aspect of making this new album. From beginning to end we will need to pay for gas, food, hotels, studio rental, tracking, mixing, mastering, album artwork, duplication, packaging, promotion, and postage. Phew! It's enough to make your head spin and we hope it paints a picture of just how vital your role is in this project. We took our time in creating some exclusive rewards, unique experiences, and a couple of ridiculous prizes to inspire you to back the project. Many of you know us pretty well and we hope that as you check out the rewards you will have a good laugh when you see just what we are willing to do to make this new record happen! As the project unfolds we will be keeping our backers up to date with exclusive video footage and blogs about our progress in making the album. Again, for those of you who know us, you can expect to see some videos marked by the boyish, humor-drenched-insanity that always seems to find us.  Anything we raise above our goal will be directed towards putting together a massive album release show, a music video, and working to get a single out on the radio.  Why Are We Using KickStarter? We have always been about connection. Connecting with people through honest lyrics, connecting with fans online, and connecting with people through an energetic live show. We believe that this new batch of songs, coupled with the fact that this album will be entirely fan funded, will take our connection with each of you to the next level. Using KickStarter allows us to show that we have just as much faith in you as you have had in us over the years!  We are thankful to have the most loyal supporters in the world and we are hopeful we will reach and exceed our goal. So Remember We only have 30 days to raise $8,000  or all the money from your pledges goes right back to you. You don't get your rewards. We can't make you any new music. And everyone will be sad. From Our Heart To Yours We are so blessed to have done this for as long as we have and we believe that it is only by God's unfailing grace and your constant support that we have been able to do so. In the last few years we've visited over half of the United States, killed a van, bought a new one, made some YouTube videos, adopted a [stuffed] squirrel, been away from home a lot, played more shows than we can even remember, and made so many new friends that we don't know what to do with them! So many of you have been with us through each of our adventures. You have shared our joy in the really great times and stood by us through the hard times. This album is our next leap forward as a band and we welcome you to join us in this new season of life. Together we can take on all of its challenges with the same faith filled smirk that we've had since the beginning; knowing all along that whether or not things pan out, in the end, everything will be just fine.  Thank you for being a part of this adventure that we call Loftland. - Dominic, Tanner, Steven, Ben, and Zach Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGill Sans is the quintessential British typeface, sometimes called the British Helvetica. It was inspired by the lettering for the London Underground, but it’s not quite the same because its creator, sculptor Eric Gill, wanted something as modern, but timeless.  \n\n\nJohnson Sans, the official font of the London Underground \n \n\n \n\n\nIt has echoes of Roman lettering, and its beauty and simplicity have always made it a standout font for displays, posters and public signage. It’s legible, and modern. It was first used in 1928 – though Gill seems to have originally devised the font for a Bristol bookshop in 1926. Since then it has been seen on everything from Ordnance Survey maps to railway signs, Penguin books to shopfronts.  \n\n\nSections of the two original prints \n \n\n \n\n\nThese beautiful display prints were first produced by the Monotype Company in 1928, clearly to market and advertise the availability of the new san serif typeface. Incredibly, they appear unique: exhaustive research has failed to throw up a single other copy of these prints. And Gill Sans, like many classic fonts, was a metal typeface.  \n\n\nSet of lower case Gill Sans letterpress type \n \n\n \n\n\nToday you can get a version of it on a computer, but nothing rivals the beautiful spacing, balance and ‘inkiness’ of the original hot metal pressings.  \n\n\nEric Gill, alongside the detailed design of his Sans Serif 'g' \n \n\n \n\n\nThese two prints showcase the font in all its aspects, upper case, lower case, numerals and notations – the ampersands and semicolons – that Eric Gill first hand crafted in 1928. \nIn consultation with a printer, I have worked to replicate the colours and the ‘feel’ of the original prints, in all their glory, eliminating some signs of wear and tear and cleaning up the surface to its original freshness. The reproductions on the video are only dummies; because they are done by laser inkjet the colours are a little muddier and the paper is too hard, which gives them a slightly false gloss effect. They don’t do justice to the finished article which, with your help, we will print on 200gsm silk paper, 610x775mm (in proper measurements, that means two foot across, or standard movie poster size), in a four colour process. I have long thought these classic prints, with their strange runic sayings, were too good not to share. \n\n\nEric Gill, self portrait, 1927 \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges As I indicate I have already selected a reliable British provincial print firm to deliver lithographic prints of each design. Each print will be inspected before dispatch, carefully rolled, and packed in a stout cardboard tube at no extra cost, and should arrive with you in May, shortly after the close of this campaign.

    "textDescription": "Story A project nearly two years in the making, finally getting near the end of the initial phase of development and near the beginning of the first publication detailing the history of Disney Television Animation. Dear fellow animation fan, For the past two years I’ve been gathering all the information available on the history of Disney Television Animation to write a book about the history of the division, the people and the shows they produced. “Why?\" you may ask.\nBecause I’ve been waiting for a book on this subject myself for over a decade. I used to scour the forums and fan sites for information, often finding that a lot of it contradicts other sources or has no official source at all. So I want to settle this once and for all. What first started as an idea to chronicle the first twenty years quickly grew out of proportion. The people I interviewed often said that one decade in itself contained so much information, that the book would be hard to read and handle. The result is the first volume of a series chronicling the history of the division on a per decade basis. But there is one bump in the process: although I have all the information I need to deliver an interesting read, I also want to offer you an interesting book to look at. I located many of the original show pitches and development artwork, but to feature these in the book, I will have to pay The Walt Disney Company to license the images. Licensing is a quite expensive process that neither the publisher or myself can carry to show the artwork to you. To break even on the cost of just one image, we would have to sell ten books… and that is not counting the costs to print and distribute the books. The book features information collected from many sources.\nLet me show you what I'm working with and what information I can offer you in return: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sourcing from a number of private archives, often held by former employees, the resources cover a lot of ground not only in production, but also on the inner workings of the studio, contact with overseas studios, budgets for the productions, invitations for screenings, studio parties and interesting insights of how many ideas changed between the inception of the idea and the completion of the first scripts for a new series. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig in to the world of animation and learn more about the different stages of animation production, taking a look at pre-production, the overseas animation and post production. I’ll present a closer look to a few hit series, with a very detailed overview of one of the hit shows of the Disney Afternoon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA detailed view on the development of the shows that ended up on the screen, but also an interesting look at how many shows changed during pre-production. Ever wondered how Double-O Duck differed from Darkwing Duck and what sort of adventures he would’ve gone on? What Gus Monigan and Colt Cheddarson were up to in Metro Mice before they were replaced by Chip ’n’ Dale to end up as the Rescue Rangers? What DuckTales would’ve been like if Duckburg was a city on an egg shaped planet in outer space? Or how they turned B Players around in a few weeks to create TaleSpin? The book does not only focus on the shows that made it to television screens around the world, but there will also be a big chapter on the shows that didn’t make it. Some ending at the idea stage of development, while others would be developed to pitches with artwork and completed scripts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the shows were developed in Los Angeles, an unfinished episode would spend most of its production time overseas at one of the many studios that Disney employed or opened overseas to deal with the actual animation. I will offer you a history told by the personnel who were at the main overseas studios (Tokyo, Sydney, Paris, London and in the second volume Vancouver and Toronto) and how Disney picked their first subcontractor, TMS, that would eventually grow a Disney operated studio \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in the book is not only sourced from documents, but also on the stories told by the people who were there. Having spent half of 2015 in Los Angeles meeting with a lot of people, using Skype, telephone and e-mail, the oral sources for this volume go well over 200 hours of information from more than 140 persons involved (not counting the sources collected for the second volume) at the many different levels of production. From animators to producers and storyboard artists to executive directors. And I’m still taking interviews to get the most complete view on the history of the division. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSadly not all of the information and materials I found during my research are suitable for the book. Audio (auditions, song demos, …), video (complete storyboard comparisons, television promos and specials, recording sessions) and artwork. So head to http://www.dtacentral.com to have a look at an interesting part of Disney Television Animation history. Just remember that the daily updated blog is just the tip of the iceberg! So to come to a conclusion: I need your help to get the artwork published.\nWhat will you get in return? As a backer, you will get the book when it is published as a thank you for your support and you will get a mention in the book to acknowledge our appreciation and your support. Another perk is an exclusive blu ray (or dvd, if you prefer) with exclusive storyboard reels, audio and other media that won’t be published online OR sold. I’m talking about media that should have been extras on the official dvd sets (if they put an effort into it). You can find a taste of what I’m talking about on the blog. Please join me in this adventure by visiting the blog often and supporting the crowdfunding campaign to license as many images as possible.\n Risks and challenges My goal is to have the book ready to ship by October, but the finished manuscript and ALL the images I want included, must be approved by Disney's legal department. If they don't agree with a part of the content, I have to change it and resubmit the manuscript and images again. This process could cause a delay in the actual printing and publishing of the book.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've started this project to produce a series of highly detailed resin buildings for use with 6mm miniature wargames. These buildings will be available in three different sizes and in several different patterns to add variety to your tabletop. Many new manufacturers have begun producing fantastic miniatures in this scale - including Onslaught Miniatures and Dark Realm Miniatures, whose outstanding models you can see featured here. I hope to provide you with an epic cityscape for your armies to battle over. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo make this happen, I've partnered with the illustrious Uncle Mike of Strange Aeons . Mike has years of experience in miniatures casting and production, and his expertise has made this project possible. While I handle the design process and production casting, the crucial moldmaking step will be contracted out to Mike to ensure the best possible quality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach building is made of five separate cast-resin parts (the walls and roof) and four plastic corner pieces. Assembly is pretty straightforward. Since these buildings are made of both plastic and resin, super (CA) glue should be used. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhy make multi-part buildings that require assembly, when most resin buildings in this scale are solid pieces? -Each building is much, much lighter. This makes shipping (especially overseas) much more affordable. -The same parts can be used over in different buildings. Small and Medium buildings in the same pattern use some of the same walls without needing to make a whole new mold -The buildings can be made modular - you can combine the parts from more than one building to create a larger structure \n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these buildings made? There's a few steps: First, each part is designed digitally. Computer-based design makes it easy to experiment and means that no time is wasted painstakingly sculpting the same identical details over and over. Next, the finished designs are sent out to be 3D printed via a MJM (Multijet Modelling) process in UV-cured acrylic plastic. Because the cost of the printing process is based entirely on the volume of the part (not its shape) lots of detail can be included at no extra cost. Once received, each piece is carefully cleaned up by hand. The prints are then handed off to Mike at Strange Aeons - he creates production molds of each part out of vacuum-degassed silicone. This material captures every tiny detail, and because each piece is flat we can use a one-part mold, meaning lower costs and less chance of air bubbles or distortion. Lastly, I take over again for production - casting each part in durable grey polyurethane resin, using a pressure-casting process to help eliminate bubbles in the final product. \n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from a variety of different add-ons to get exactly what you're looking for! If you want to customize your pledge with optional add-ons, please use our new Pledge Calculator - it will let you select the options you're looking for and tell you exactly how much to pledge. Plus, it tells me what add-ons you'd like so I can plan out production. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons will ship separately from your regular Pledge level - most of the Pledge levels were designed to fall just under a weight threshold for shipping and don't really have room to add anything. I've done my best to lay out the shipping for add-ons to be as inexpensive as possible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Pledge level will give you a number of buildings of each size - for each building in your pledge, you can select from any pattern available in that size. After the campaign, you'll be sent a backer survey for you to specify the exact combination you'd like. Choose the pattern for each building individually. Mix and match to your heart's content! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more funding, I'll be able to offer more patterns of buildings and even a few neat little pieces to add to your rewards for free! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started this project because it was an interesting challenge, but in order to create these buildings economically and in a bunch of different patterns I need more equipment and financing than I can really afford to cover myself. That's why I've chosen Kickstarter, and despite the popularity of the crowdfunding platform for hobby projects I believe it lets me offer a quality product at the best value for your money, without having to break the bank myself. If successfully funded, here's what your pledges will support: - Raw materials for fulfilling your rewards, primarily resin for casting and plastic stock for the corner pieces - 3D printing and moldmaking for the new styles of buildings I'd like to offer - Production equipment including the compressor and pressure pot for casting - Shipping costs for delivering your rewards - Business licensing to ensure production conforms to local laws \n\n\n\n\n\nEvery pledge includes shipping to backers in Canada and the US. Rewards will be shipped via Canada Post - in Canada, your pledge will be sent via Expedited Parcel. US pledges will be shipped by Small Packet Air (Sprawl and Architect pledges are too heavy to send to the US by that method, so they'll be sent by Expedited USA). For backers outside the US or Canada, you'll need to pay an extra fee to cover shipping - I've tried to keep this as low as possible while still ensuring that you can receive your stuff in a timely fashion. The amount required is described in each Pledge level. Your rewards will be sent via Small Packet Air, so you won't be waiting weeks for it to arrive while still keeping costs manageable. For any Small Packet Air shipment, your package unfortunately cannot be tracked, and is usually delivered by your country's postal service. While I will make the utmost effort to get you your buildings, I'm unable to replace packages that are lost in shipping. Your government may assess additional customs duties or taxes at the border. These aren't included in your pledge or shipping fee, and are the responsibility of the backer (sorry!). With miniatures games, having a strong local community is key. If you're a Calgary gamer (or thereabouts) and can pick up your rewards at The Sentry Box, I'll happily refund any shipping costs associated with your pledge upon delivery. Find us at sentrybox.com - stop in and say hi! Risks and challenges Because this is the first project like this I've undertaken, it will be a learning process. I'm not an expert (yet) and some steps may take a couple tries to get right. But the basic process is sound: the printing process works, some of the molds have already been made and the first small batch of parts has been completed. Mike at Strange Aeons is an industry professional and has already provided vital advice and support.\n\nWasteland Studio is a one-man operation, and the responsibility for completing and delivering your rewards is mine alone. All funds raised will be kept in a separate bank account to ensure they are spent only on the project, and if something should happen to me and I'm unable to complete the project, any unspent funds can be refunded to the backers.\n\nWhile 3D printing can be a tricky technology to use, I'm using a company I've done business with several times in the past, with a proven track record of successful prints and solid customer service if things don't turn out quite right. All parts printed for this project so far have turned out beautifully with no reprints required.\n\nIf demand exceeds expectations, more production time may be required to complete the project. Fortunately, there are a few ways to offset this - with the additional funding I'll be able to pay for additional molds to produce more parts quickly, and purchase additional equipment (like a second pressure pot) to increase output.

To do it right, they need your help ! In order to do the music justice, the band wants to record it in the right studio situation - one that is not only state-of-the-art but also has the capacity to lay down tracks both digitally and on tape.  Plus, the Standells will be using an authentic Vox Continental.  The funds raised here on Kickstarter will be used towards those studio costs, tape stock, engineering, artwork, design, CD duplication and vinyl pressing expenses for all those who still love their 45's and 33 1/3's .  The Standells have learned from experience - No major label suits will be allowed in the recording studio and no producers will be dictating to them what to record.

    "textDescription": "Story Who am I?  I am a storyteller. I create stories from information and experiences I find interesting and magical. As a mother of two I want my children to have the opportunity to enjoy stories about activities that are familiar and people that look like them. But, there aren't many picture books available for children from Caribbean and Latina/o countries. I want to create stories that celebrate these traditions and histories, allowing all children and families to join in on adventures to new worlds within cities with which they’re familiar.  \n\n\nMy daughter learning bomba \n \n\n \n\n\nIn January 1996 I visited Chicago’s Puerto Rican Humboldt Park neighborhood for the first time. The flags, fifty-nine feet tall and fifty-six feet wide, that mark the beginning and end of Paseo Boricua, were HUGE! I found these flags appropriate for a community with tremendous hope and big dreams.  In 1997 I moved to Chicago and, that summer, helped create the mosaic designs for the community garden on Division Street, La Casita de don Pedro. I spent a lot of time in this community garden. My daughter and I learned to sing and dance bomba at La Casita. We left Chicago in 2000 but the images of the flags and the wonderful, dynamic community in Humboldt Park stayed with me. When I began researching and writing about Puerto Rican communities in the United States I knew I had to create a story to celebrate Chicago and the flags. The story is Planting Flags on Division Street / Plantando banderas en la calle Division . \n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nWhere did this project come from?  What’s the story behind the story?  In June, 2014 my story “Music and Memory on Division Street,” was published in the magazine Que Ondee Sola . This inspired me to attend classes with Los Pleneros de la 21 in East Harlem to learn more about bomba and the School of Visual Arts to better illustrate and lay out the story. Also, in May, 2015 my children’s book Sofi and the Magic, Musical Mural / Sofi y el mágico mural musical was published by Arte Público Press. This first publication has met with very positive reviews, receiving 5 stars from Foreword Reviews, and has helped me learn about the children’s book industry.\n What is the Impact?  There are very few books by Latinos about Latinos. For example, in 2014 out of approximately 5,000 children’s books published in the U.S.A. only 125 were either by Latinos or about Latinos. 66 children’s books were written about Latinos and only 59 were written by and about Latinos. Many of these stories focus on food or holidays. While some of these stories are biographies of famous Latinos, there aren’t enough stories that celebrate the scope and variety of accomplishments within our communities. Furthermore, no recent children’s publications explore the Afro Puerto Rican music and dance of bomba. \n\n\nA bomba rhythm played on the tambores \n \n\n \n\n\nPlanting Flags on Division Street / Plantando banderas en la calle Division is a ‘sliding door’ allowing readers to lose themselves in the rhythm of the bomba drum. Karina, misses her grandfather a lot but once she lets go of her anger and loneliness the music of the cuá , the bomba drums and the maraca take her away. The dance and music allow her to mourn her loss and to celebrate the community and friendships that she has. Ultimately, Karina finds the strength to believe and finds hope that Abuelo Oscar will soon come home. \n What are you planning to make?  Planting Flags on Division Street / Plantando banderas en la calle Division is a 32-page bilingual picture book for children ages 4 to 8 that explores the Afro-Boricua dance and music of bomba while celebrating public art and community.  The 32 page English/Spanish manuscript, complemented with an author’s note about the flag, general information about Bomba and a glossary is complete.  Thirty-four watercolors illustrate and complete the story.  I am currently working on educational materials, a Teacher’s Guide and an Activities Booklet, to complement the picture book.  \n\n\nKarina is ready for her imagination to soar! \n \n\n \n\n\nWhat am I Asking?\n I am asking for $3,000 to cover the cost related to layout, printing and promotional materials for the Planting Flags . I am working with a team in New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Orlando, and Puerto Rico. We are committed to creating quality, bilingual children’s literature at an affordable price and, because of this, will have the book available in softcover, hardcover and as an Ebook, so that our story can get into as many hands as possible. Having recently released a children’s book with Arte Público Press, I am very aware that promotional materials for a book can make or break a book, and want to have the resources available to launch a PR and social media ampaign that will reach out to libraries and community centers with the hope that our book is in the hands of as many children and families as possible, so that it can be enjoyed and shared. \n\n\nPlanting Flags Development & Publishing Budget \n \n\n \n\n\nOther Ways to Help Planting Flags Everywhere \nEmail, text, share on social media information about the campaign and about the book \nShare the book and our work with people and children you know \nFacilitate a book presentation / signing at a bookstore \n Risks and challenges As of right now the 32 page English/Spanish manuscript, with an author’s note about the flag, general information about bomba and a glossary is complete and has been edited. Thirty-four watercolor illustrations complete the story. We are currently proofing the layout and design of the prototype of book.\n\nIn the coming weeks we will create educational materials, a Teacher’s Guide and an Activities Booklet, to complement the picture book. We are also designing a flier and book marker to promote the book. We will also have the book printed in hardback, paperback and available in Ebook format. \n\nThere are a few tasks left, but we will accomplish them with your support! \n\nTimeline:\n\nWeek 1, November 2nd – 8th:\nFinalize the book lay-out (text and images)\nRevise a prototype of the book\n\nWeek 2, November 9th – 15th: \nCreate promotional materials (flier, book marker) \n\nWeek 3, November 16th – 22nd:\nFinalize promotional book and materials\nShare promotional materials at a bombazo party\nBomba demo by Jorge Vazquez of Los Pleneros de la 21 to celebrate the book on Wednesday, November 18th\n\nJOIN US: Boricua College, 186 N. 6th Street, Brooklyn, NY\n 5pm-6pm\n\n\nAttend Comite Noviembre Author Expo to promote the book on Saturday, November 21st\n\nJOIN US: Hostos Community College, Bronx, NY\n 12 noon to 7pm \n\nWeek 4, November 23rd – November 28th:\nPromote the book in other major cities\n\nWeek 5, November 29th - December 6th\nFinalize preparations for first printing run and rewards shipment\n\n\nWeek 7, December 6th - 13th\nCelebrate success!\nShip books, guides, activity booklets and posters to backers in time for Christmas AND Día de Los Reyes!!!

In 2007 I released my first, The Times Compiled (http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-times-compiled/id266031301 ), which contained songs I'd written over the two or three years prior to that— my \"Katrina years.\" I'd like to think those years are over. Now it's 2010, and I have songs I've written over the last three. I can't let them feel less special than the other songs, so I think they deserve a good recording session. And they deserve to be heard by people who want to hear them that can't attend my live shows. And that requires a gosh darn recording. \nIn the late summer and fall, I plan to get back into the studio with my lovable bunch of hooligan bandmates and put together a new album. I'd like to even pull a few other New Orleans musicians into the recording mix. Recording, mixing, producing, printing, copyrighting, distributing, and getting the dern word out all cost moneys. Moneys which I don't have. \nI think generosity is something that often goes overlooked, and it appears Kickstarter does, too. So we're going to reward that generosity of yours by offering you the album, plus merch, plus more for your support. Your pledges will make the recording possible, and you'll also get a better deal on the album & merch. It's a win/win. I love win/wins, and I feel like they don't happen all that often. So, in a sense, this a very rare moment. A special one. One that bonds us together forever.

    "textDescription": "Story Greetings Folks! Thank you for taking the time to check out my KickStarter Page. Some of you know this has been a long time coming and I am pleased to finally be in a place to share my dream with you. My name is Zuri and in the derby world I'm ZipBlok. I prefer \"she\" and \"her\" pronouns, and am sexologist, sex therapist, sex educator, photographer, graphic artist and designer, derby enthusiast, gym rat, food lover/cook, and DJ by day and night and a fashion designer, pattern maker, and seamstress absolutely any in-between time I have. I have been developing patterns, sizing alternative markers, and clothing ideas for gender neutral, gender non-conforming, and gender non-specified fashion for about 5 years. I started with bathing suits, then bathing suit cover-ups, and now jackets for humans, fur-babies, and tiny human babies. For the first time, I would like to do this as a business venture by using my awesome friends, family, and derby community as my platform. I just wanted to make something for everyone to feel confident, attractive, and free in whatever that means for them without worrying about what department their clothing comes from. Presentation and personal expression is so important to identity and just being exactly whomever you are. I just want to help create the space to do it out loud and start the conversations that need to be happening about it all. I can be a one person show for this venture's pre-production, production, and execution from me to customers but I need the help of my community to get started! Business Venture Start-Up Needs: \n $35 Minimum/month x 2 months ($70): A web platform/commerce site \n $800: Start up Material for Production average $6-10/yard fabric, thread,  aglets, drawstring cord, pattern making material \n $100: Adjustable mannequin to help with proper sizing \n $150: Serger for Finishing Products - low end used or new \n $200: Initial shipping charges and Materials for packaging and  shipping \n $130: Labels for logo, sizing, and washing instructions \n TOTAL START-UP: $1,450 This is the bare, bare minimum. I really want to try to raise more but with this, I can at least get this thing going by getting all of the supplies I need to start.  Average Jacket Cost to Consumer: $45\nAverage Fur-Baby Jacket Cost: $30 Average Tiny Human Baby Cost: $25 More Clothing Specifics \n\n Customizing Potential - Vinyl Printing! Make your clothing say what you want! Literally...some ideas below-Derby - Name and Numbers Prints on Back, Team Logos or names on Front. Scrimmage jerseys that are reversible. -Babies - #1 Parents on front-Pets - Name and Parent number printed in collar of jacket \n\n Reversible Jersey Jackets - Black and white or team colors with names and numbers \n\n Ref/NSO jackets - pink on one side ref stripes on the other \n\n Custom Design Options - pockets, pouches, hoods, slouch necks, zippers, different drawstring types and colors \n\nFashion Jackets - These can be of heavier or just different material that could stand alone or be used for a bathing suite cover up. \n The Name Game Another part of this venture will be including our community in choosing a name for the clothing line! I have some idea from various folks and some of my own that I could just go with but this seems like a lot more fun. I want to create movement and voice to what this line means to the fashion industry and I want to start that with its name. Be creative, innovative, community oriented or just fun...including a \"Z\" gets you bonus points!Please send me any name suggestions you have to go in the sorting hat and they will be considered. The winner will be announced at the end of this kickstarter as well as their prize! Risks and challenges I feel like there are a lot of risks and challenges to the successful completion of this project but none of these make me less confident in the ability to execute fully and successfully.\n\nI have been sewing my entire life and have often given pieces as gifts. I, however, have never been in business for myself in any capacity let alone tried to break the seal of the fashion industry. I am skilled and have a little professional training but am concerned about creating professional finished looking products. My solution here is to outsource professional cutters and a one time pattern creator to use what I have already created in home and make exact measurements and cutting instructions. This will be an added expense and potentially disrupt my timeline, but it will not end the venture. \n\nAnother concern is being able to maintain the production speed necessary for this project without getting behind. This may eventually require another seamstress. I already have one lined up in the event that this happens.\n\nThere are a lot of moving pieces here for me that I have to be really organized and on top of and I think that will be a challenge that I am excited about. I will be designing and maintaining the website, designing, producing and maintaining inventory, and completing and shipping orders. Eventually I will also be going to derby tournaments and events to set up and sell, as well. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Pictured above is a church model meticulously built by Joseph Carey Merrick, the Elephant Man, while he resided as a patient at London Hospital in the late 1800s. I have\nthe opportunity to direct a stage production of Bernard Pomerance's play The Elephant Man in one of Los Angeles’ most historic and beautiful\nsacred spaces—St. John’s Episcopal Cathedral.  Performances are set for January 30 through February 8, 2014.  Some \nroles have already been cast, and rehearsals begin in late December.  \nThe St. John's Cathedral Arts Guild has generously donated rehearsal space \nand some significant promotional assistance.  I am prompted to set the production in a sacred space by one of the play’s own recurring and potent\nimages--Merrick building a model of St. Philip’s Church in his hospital\napartment. I will explore how my choice of venue, in this case a formal worship space,\nunderlines Pomerance’s critique of Victorian charity and his\nextraordinary theological understanding of redemption and divine love, all\nwithin what is considered a secular drama.  This project will demonstrate how artistic choices affect and create religious\nmeaning\n\n In\n2002, I directed Pomerance’s play as a religion and art case study at Emory\nUniversity—Atlanta.  It was my thesis\nproject for the completion of a master’s degree.  The production helped underscore my own\nclaims regarding the viable intersection of art and religion.  The play was staged in a small, black-box\ntheatre through the generous cooperation of Theatre Emory.  The production was a success on many fronts,\nand I now wish to explore the play again, this time in a sacred space.  Here is an e-mail response from a seminary student who attended my 2002 production: With my prominent \ntrach (tracheotomy), I can relate to seeing horror in people's faces. \nI've seen people grab at their own throats in horror when they first see\n me. At the very least, there is the quick looking away when people \nnotice that I can see them staring. Then there's always the kid at \nMcDonald's who freaks out so badly he or she can't manage to take my \norder… The hard feelings that experiences like these produce are \nbalanced by the more frequent experience of people looking up from my \ntrach into my face and smiling, especially children. There is a special \nblessing in being part of the transformation that takes place when a \nperson looks beyond initial appearance, and experiences a human being \nwithin that appearance. And it’s amazing… that transformation doesn't \nrequire a bearing of souls or bodies, or even exchanging words. Risks and challenges Your contribution will be in my competent and capable hands. I've been part of countless grass-roots efforts as a director and producer, often alongside Diane Kondrat when she headed up Oasis Productions. Memorable productions like Bold Girls, One Flea Spare, and the recent powerhouse production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? will serve as reference points. Please visit the websites I've provided on my bio page to learn more about Pomerance's play and to read a review of the most recent production I directed.

As with a lot of psychological pieces, \"Sandbox\" is as much about what is going on in Daniel's head as what is physically occurring on the page.  Through this template, we seek to explore a lot of abstract but important themes which don't get a lot of exposure in college-based films, including the natures of mental illness and anxiety, the feeling of being out of control, the tensions between individuality and societal expectation, and the impossibility of forcing one's way into an ideal, fulfilling life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we are lucky enough to have some funding in the form of a BU grant and some personal savings, we need considerably more to attain our desired quality of production and to ensure that every crew member, actor/actress and location manager is compensated fairly.  Some of the specific resources we can secure with your help include: \n\nCameras and Lighting - Because this is a production which is both feature-length and filled with sequences that employ high contrast aesthetics, we will need to rent professional cinematic lenses and lighting equipment.  Additionally, as various scenes use slow motion to create a sense of style and to convey the dissociation experienced by the protagonist, we will need a camera which can film at a high frame rate and resolution in extreme slow motion. \n\nSet Design and Wardrobe - In order to portray environments such as a college campus, a populated party and a sterile laboratory as accurately and attractively as possible, we must \"dress\" each location with props and actors and tailor it to match the mood and feel of a scene. \n\nAn Awesome Crew (Beyond Us Four)  - To make a 100-minute film, we need a lot of talent both in front of and behind the cameras.  In addition to the actors portraying the two leads and nearly a dozen supporting characters, we need helpers in aspects of production ranging from lighting to makeup and want to make sure everybody involved receives the pay they deserve. \n\nLocations - With over 20 different locations, some of them set in hard-to-reach places like stores, studios and campus dormitories and lecture halls, we will need to pay to get permits and to rent out spaces for a reasonable amount of time. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges As with any film project, there is the possibility that unforeseen circumstances can arise and create additional obstacles for our shoots. We are cognizant of the complexity of the production process and have taken many precautions to ensure that whatever happens, we are prepared to finish this film as scheduled and within our proposed budget.\n\nThe major issues which might impede a production include losing access to resources such as talent and locations, complications on filming days such as inclement weather, an unexpectedly long shoot, or malfunctioning equipment, and problems with data storage in post-production such as when the devices storing the original film footage stop working. To guarantee that we are not taken down by any of these issues, we have included many backup resources in the budget and have thought carefully about all aspects of this film and what we need to do to mitigate risks: we have been careful to choose a crew and are currently in the process of choosing a cast who are reliable and who are committed to the project, and we are making sure to have two (or more) of everything, be it an SD card, a 2 Terabyte external hard drive, or a light operator.

    "textDescription": "Story This ambitious project aims to bring to life Alfred Noyes' poem The Highwayman  (1906) on screen. Our short film is a ten minute period adaptation, a romantic tragedy, set upon the cornish moorland.  \n\n\nLocation Recce on Bodmin Moor \n \n\n \n\n\nFor our filming locations, we searched for properties that were accurate to the period; and with the help of The National Trust, we will be filming at the Tintagel Old Post Office, the water mill at Cotehele, as well as a Georgian farm house upon Bodmin Moor. \n\n\nTintagel Old Post Office | Cotehele Mill \n \n\n \n\n\nOur actors previous works include Poldark, Doc Martin and a number of short films in and around Cornwall. \n\n\nThe Actors! \n \n\n \n\n\nWhilst out Kickstarter target is £1500, every pound exceeding that amount helps to secure more accurate and detailed costumes for the actors, and props to dress the sets with. As well as being able to support a larger cast and bring in support for working with a horse in such a harsh environment. \n\n\nBudget Breakdown \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOliver Chater \n \n\n \n\n\nDirector - Oliver Chater Born in London, Living in LA, Oliver is currently in his final year studying BA (Hons) Film at Falmouth University.

Previously producing a documentary featuring Tony Robinson, she was 1st AD and Foley Artist for short film Synthetica (2015, Winner of Best Cinematography, Reading Fringe; Official Selection at the Skinny Short Film Festival, Fingal Film Festival and Thurrock International Film Festival). Recently, Claire has worked in the Sound Department on feature film Brown Willy as well as editor and sound designer for CMS Supatrak’s E-Learning library. \n\n\nJames Lee-Warner \n \n\n \n\n\nEditor - James Lee-Warner James is in his third year of Film at Falmouth University with a focus on editing. Much of his past work has revolved around narrative and compilation video editing, having worked on 'Behind the Line' and 'Toast No. 5' as narrative films and recently this summer documenting Somersault Festival and Looe Music Festival. Away from this, James was also an editor on 'The Peoples String Foundation – St. Ives Guild Hall' concert video, here James refined his skills in working on large-scale projects that are necessary to match The Highwayman’s ambition. \n\n\nBecky Quinn \n \n\n \n\n\nHair and Makeup - Becky Quinn Becky is currently studying for her final year of Film at Falmouth University. She has shadowed many professional makeup artist on BBC shows such as ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ and ‘The Jools Holland show’.

Editing Assistant - Shannon Darby-Jones Shannon is a level 2 fashion photography student at Falmouth University with experience backstage photography, retouching and video editing. \n\n\nThe VFX Crew! \n \n\n \n\n\nVFX Supervisor - Elliott Birch Mackay Elliott's interest in Visual Effect started when he was young working on a few videos for his friends YouTube channel, although the work was not specifically VFX related it did eventually lead him down the right paths to do a degree in the field. Now he has the amazing opportunity to be the VFX supervisor on this project, he hope to further my knowledge of what this role entails and how he works in conjunction with the other roles on set. Elliott is unbelievably excited to work on this project and looks forward to the outcome. VFX Production Co-ordinator - Kylie Kamanga Kylie is a second year animation and visual effects student at Falmouth University. She specialize in Visual Effects. Before my university studies, she did Art and Design foundation degrees at Leeds college of art, where her interest in constructive media such as animation began. Kylie's interest in film and production started after doing a summer school at Harewood House run by frequent TV producer David Lascelles. For The Highwayman she will be VFX Co-ordinator, which involves a lot of organising and translating what the director wants to the VFX artists. VFX - Karolina Papp Karolina's interest in visual effects began during my Foundation year before university, when she first began experimenting with animation. She taught herself to use After Effects, and found that she could do some pretty cool stuff with it, and since then has been aiming to improve her knowledge of other software. In the future, she hopes to work in the film industry and create exciting visuals to enhance films. The Highwayman has always been a favourite poem of hers, and as part of the VFX team she will be mainly removing parts of scenes (e.g. unwanted signs, electrical wires, etc), to continue historical accuracy, or adding in sky replacements amongst other things to give the film a romantic, Georgian aesthetic. VFX - Harry Orford Harry is studying animation and visual effects at Falmouth University. He is currently aiming to become a compositor and a 3D generalist in the VFX industry in London, but he's also had some previous experience working with motion capture at the Imaginarium studio on a music video for Hot Chip. VFX - Ashely Howard Ashely is a Second year animation and VFX student. He has had a keen interest in the VFX industry for a long time, it started out with watching VFX focused comedy shorts from YouTube video producers: FreddieW, Rocketjump and Corridor Digital. From there he started seeking out VFX breakdowns from some of my favourite Hollywood blockbusters and the major studios behind the FX, seeing the level of detail and the artistic talent behind the incredible visuals had him hooked. The opportunity to work as a VFX artist on ‘The Highwayman’ is great, as it allows him to work on a project where the VFX work needed is very similar/ identical to the work done in the industry. The project allows Ashely to gain experience in working on an actual live action film. The main area for his work would be removing images that don’t fit with the time period, for example: replacing the sky to make shots look better without drawing attention away from the actors. VFX - Flo Green Flo discovered visual effects at a young age of 14. The combination of art, maths and computing was just perfect for her and she couldn't believe that a job existed that was exactly what she was interested in. Flo loves being able to be a part of putting someones story onto screen and letting the audience step into a new reality. She hope to follow my career into the VFX industry after she graduates. \n\n\nJonathan Wilson \n \n\n \n\n\nStills Photographer - Jonathan Wilson Jonathan is an enthusiastic individual, studying Fashion Photography, with a vocation to become a successful image-maker in industry. Passionate with a growing appreciative interest in period drama and history, he aspires to further develop my photographic skills and establish a standing in cinema, fashion and editorial. He is the film stills photographer for The Highwayman, documenting on-set and creating imagery and portraiture for use in marketing and publicity with a consistent period style and aesthetic for the film. Risks and challenges The primary challenge of this film is it's ambition. Establishing a cinematic world within an accurate Georgian period is difficult, which is why we need your help in securing costumes, props and locations.\n\nThe main risks involved stem down to the imperative for your financial aid, so as to ensure not only a fantastically accurate and cinematic end piece, but also a safe production through and through.

    "textDescription": "Story Hi Werewolfers! \nFirst off, thank you very much for taking the time to check out my project.  Werewolf has been a big part of my life and I'm so glad to be sharing the cards and getting more and more people to have fun with the game. I also wanted to say that my goal is to get all of the cards to you guys in time for Halloween.  That is a pretty lofty goal, but as long as no huge obstacles pop up, I think it should be achievable. \nFor those of you who don't know about the awesome game of Werewolf or about my previous project that sold the starter set of Werewolf cards, please visit this link. If you don't feel like clicking the link, please just know that I didn't create the game of Werewolf, I just created artwork on cards to use when playing the game, or to use as a bookmark, or to throw at your little sister - it's really whatever you want to use them for. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you like what you see and would like to purchase my original set of Werewolf cards  (that includes a plastic case and original rule book) to add to this expansion set, visit my online store here .  Limited quantities are available.  Purchasing here is the only way to receive the entire original deck, complete with case and original rule book. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy most recent project: Full Moon Expansion, will also be available at my Etsy store in the near future.  Again, click here  to visit my store.  Favorite the shop to receive updates about new products being added. \nNow that that business is out of the way, onto the NEW CARDS ! \nThe All Hallows' Eve expansion set is very near and dear to my heart because it contains several characters that remind me specifically of Halloween.  Some of the characters don't have a very Halloween-y vibe, but you'll be able to recognize the ones that do.  A few of these are definitely geared towards the Halloween crowd with the fear elements (the Banshee and Creature are a ton of fun to use in games).  I hope you guys enjoy these as much I did in creating them! \nWHITE WOLF - The White Wolf is a loner and doesn't play by the rules of any pack.  During the game, every other night, the White Wolf will be asked who it wants to kill separately from all of the other Werewolves.  It may even attack and kill another Werewolf if it chooses.  If the White Wolf manages to kill/outlast all of the other Werewolves, it wins.  If the Werewolves win the game, play continues until either the White Wolf wins of the regular Werewolves.  It's a fight to the end!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTIST - The Artist is constantly working and may only communicate through drawing.  The Artist will draw a picture of the person they believe to be a Werewolf.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEVIL - The Devil is pure evil and can find your weaknesses.  This player has a Seer-like ability and may find out another player's identity every other night, but is invisible to all players.  Since the Seer looks in souls, the Seer will die if they ask about the Devil's identity.  So...devilish? (I know.  I'm terrible.)  Also, the Devil can be killed, as he is just possessing an innocent Villager's body after all.  If the Devil survives until the end of the game, he wins against any other character. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLERIC - The Cleric is a timid soul, but he definitely has protection.  The Cleric has holy water.  Before the day vote, the Cleric may choose to splash holy water on a person.  If they are a Werewolf, Vampyre, or Devil, they will instantly die and no vote will take place.  If the person is human, play goes on as usual.  The Cleric may use the holy water 2 times during the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLUNATIC - The Lunatic has escaped imprisonment and wants to kill everyone and ruin the game.  The player, when prompted as night, will choose one player to pour oil on.  At any point during the game, the player may toss a match and instantly kill all players with oil on them.  If the player manages to kill all of the remaining players, the Lunatic wins!  Hooray??? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCARECROW - The Scarecrow is somewhat terrifying.  At night, if the Scarecrow is selected by the Werewolves to be killed, they will be terrified and cannot kill for one night.  This only works once for the Scarecrow because the Werewolves won't be fooled twice.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MONSTER - A certain Dr. Frankenstein created a Monster and he has wandered into our fair village.  The Monster needs power to survive, so every time a special character dies, that is not a Villager, the Monster will absorb their energy and gain their power.  Human based characters that use items to perform powers, such as the Witch, Cleric, etc., cannot not have their powers absorbed.  Sorry.  Even though the Monster is hated by the Villagers, he once befriended a small child that showed him that he doesn't have to be the Monster that everyone expects him to be. He is on the Villager's side.  Hooray! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBANSHEE - The Banshee is an Irish omen of death/wailing spirit that will terrify all of the players in the game.  She is a normal Villager during the day, so that is where her loyalties lie.  During any night phase, at any moment they choose, the Banshee will take over and the player will scream at the top of their lungs.  The Moderator will then decide which player was most frightened and that person will instantly die.  This ability can only be used once.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACK - Jack is the true spirit of Halloween and will provide a trick and treat each night.  During each night phase, when prompted by the Moderator, Jack will throw a piece of candy at another player to both startle and treat them.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATURE - The Creature lives in the village's local lake.  Despite its appearance, it really isn't that menacing...just messy.  During each night phase, the Creature will rise from his lake to pick a villager to give his version of a hello.  When prompted by the Moderator, this player will silently choose another player to have the Moderator squirt with some water.  A spray bottle or small squirt gun works best.  The creature will have had it's fun and return to the lake to laugh about that poor sap that it scared. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***BONUS CARD FOR THE FIRST 400 BACKERS*** \nDEATH - Death watches the world we live in, deciding who it might take next.  This player never closes their eyes during the game.  Like Death, they see everything.  The Werewolves and other special characters that open their eyes at night may see Death, but it would be in their best interest to not reveal that player to everyone because Death cannot die.  If Death is chosen to be killed during the day phase, Death will become enraged that these insignificant beings would attempt to end him.  In his rage, Death will choose a random player to die.  Death will become calm again and play will resume as usual.  It's best to stay on his good side.  The game will end once three players are left.  Death and two others.  If both are Werewolves, or Villagers, he will side with them and the game is over.  If there is one of each side in the end, Death will flip a coin and decide one player to die, while the other wins the game.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n COMMISSION PLEDGES: \nAt the urging of lots of backers during previous Kickstarter projected, I've decided to include a pledge level that will include the cards, plus a commission done by myself just for you.   \nHow will you create the images? \nThese will be done digitally.  I work at my quickest rate digitally and I want to be able to get you guys an awesome print as quickly as possible. \nHow will it get to me?    \nThe images will be printed by a great printing company and shipped directly to you.   \nWhat size will it be? \nThey will be 11X14 inches, but can be printed smaller, if you so choose. I will send out messages to all Commission backers to get all of the info about your images. \nWhat will you draw for me? \nI will one character/figure with a minimal background.  Basically, the focus will be on the character.  I will draw pretty much anything you want, but I reserve the right to refuse any idea that is obviously offensive in any capacity.  Also, no likenesses, as they are very time consuming.  If you have a question about a possible idea, just message me.  I'll do any character from a comic, movie, etc., but again I reserve the right to refuse any idea that might get me in trouble.  I can also do an obscure character if you have one, but you will probably have to send me some reference if I can't find any on my own.  If you don't have any ideas or just don't care, I'll be happy to come up with an idea of my own for you as well. \nWill you do more than one character if I ask? \nYes, within reason.  If you have an idea with multiple characters, or just something outside the realm of a character, I will certainly discuss with you the idea and let you know of any additional cost. \nWhen will I get if? \nThis will really be determined by how many Commission pledges I receive.  If there aren't very many, I will try to have them done in time for holidays (if this is a gift for someone).  If there are a great deal of backers at this pledge level, then it might be longer, but I will be in touch with all of the Commission backers to keep them in the loop about when they will get their print.    \nIf you guys have any additional questions about a possible commission, please feel free to message me.  Thanks!    \nPRINTABLE RULES: \nHere are some images of the rules for all of the new cards that you guys can print, if you so desire.  Thanks! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Risks and challenges There is always the potential for production and/or shipping delays. The cards will be produced in the US, but there is always the possibility of a delay. \n\nSome of you may ask how it will be possible to get the cards out in time for Halloween. My answer to that would be that I've made special arrangements with my printer and as long as there aren't any huge hiccups, things should work out. \n\nPlease know that I will do everything in my power to get everything printed and shipped out as quickly as possible, hopefully in time for Halloween. \n\nThe international backers have the biggest possibility of not receiving their cards in time for Halloween, so please know I'll be working as quickly as humanly possible to get them to you in time. \n\nAlso, there is always the risk that everyone will be sick and tired of me saying \"buy my cards, please\" and will not back the project, causing the project not to be funded and the expansion set would never see the light of day. That would be sad. So very, very sad. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story iDiOM Theater is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization dedicated to developing and producing world-premier performances, providing local and international artists a venue to create and perform original material, and giving audiences diverse, immediate, accessible exposure to new and established theater works.\n iDiOM artists believe in theater that is daring, vital, innovative, irreverent, and evolving. By continually producing new works, iDiOM employs, empowers, and celebrates local writers, actors, and collaborators of all kinds.\nAlmost every production at iDiOM has never been done anywhere else. The iDiOM is entering its 10th season and has been an active part of the community since 2001. We strive to keep theater affordable and accessible by keeping ticket prices low and offering free tickets to every show in our season, for people who otherwise would not or could not see theater.  Our Kickstarter campaign goal is set for $3,000 which is the cost of our production budget for the 2012-2013 season. This covers the cost of paint, costumes, sets, programs, and props for our entire season. Help us keep producing local, original work! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can visit our website here: www.idiomtheater.com  and check out our full calendar of shows! Risks and challenges Since the iDiOM makes a big effort to buy from local businesses, that can mean buying things that are a bit more expensive, which makes it much easier to go over budget. In order to combat that, we try to buy used or recycled products when possible, which helps us stay within our production budget, but still lets us buy locally.\n\nOne of our main challenges as a non-profit is keeping low ticket prices, and thus keeping our ticket sales consistent. In order to try to keep people coming back and allowing people to try out theater, we offer 10 free Public Tickets to every show in our season to allow people to come see art who otherwise would not or could not. These Public Tickets are sponsored by local businesses, but with economic decline, getting business sponsors is becoming increasingly difficult. Thankfully, because we make an effort to support local businesses, they are also willing to support us.\n\nWe also face the challenge of building and retaining a strong volunteer base. Working the box office, painting and building sets, photographing and video taping shows, creating and putting up posters; having enough volunteers who are willing and capable to put forth the time that is necessary for completing these tasks is a challenge in itself. In order to keep a strong volunteer base, we compensate our volunteers with gifts from our business sponsors.\n\nEven if we don't get funding from Kickstarter, our season will continue. If that is the case, we will have to find the money elsewhere; business sponsorships, grants, ticket revenue, ect. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Spireseeker is a fantasy novel by first-time author E.D.E. Bell about identity, friendship, and the search for destiny. It is currently in the editing stages, with a tentative publication date of Fall 2013. It follows the story of Beryl, a young elf who discovers that she is not who she thinks she is but instead is looked to as the one remaining hope, based on the prophecy of a magical creature. Beryl gets a lot of help along the way from her grandparents and her unlikely best friend.  It is a classic fantasy tale with many twists, that focuses as much on the relationships between the characters as on the storyline itself. We have chosen to self-publish this book for several reasons.  First, the finished manuscript will be approximately 200,000 words.  This is longer than most traditional publishers are comfortable with for a first-time author.  Self publishing also allows the author to tell the story the way she wants it told. We are working with two very talented artists to do illustrations for the book. Anna Rettberg in New York (http://annarettberg.blogspot.com/ ) is creating the front and back cover illustrations, and Kyle Walblay in Ohio is creating 52 individual chapter title illustrations. We are excited to be working with these women. Kickstarter funding will be used to complete the illustrations, pay for professional editing services, and to offset the cost of the initial hardcover printing.  We hope you like the rewards offered, including signed books and artwork from the illustrators. It is a dream of the author's to write fantasy. She is excited to share this first novel with you, and hopeful you will enjoy it. Thanks for your time and consideration! Risks and challenges The risks and challenges to this project are schedule related. The author has completed a second rewrite of the manuscript, which is now ready for a round of editing by a professional editor.\n\nRisks to the schedule include completion of the illustrations (including the map, for which we are still looking for a cartographer for this work), time delays in the professional editing and rewrites from this edit, and finally typesetting and printing delays.\n\nGiven these challenges, we are currently on schedule and fully expect to have the book completed by the end of the year. We will keep regular updates to the book project on both this Kickstarter project page, as well as the book's Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Spireseeker).

    "textDescription": "Story What is it? allbeerfinder.com is a live website that allows you to search beers to suit your tastes. It’s a bit old, doesn't list all the beers we've evaluated, it’s not pretty and it it’s too shy to share all the information our database contains. However, it works, and gets around 50,000 hits per month but we're much more ambitious than that... \n\n\nCurrent website search page \n \n\n \n\n\nWith your help allbeerfinder.com will be replaced, upgraded and complemented by an all new App to become the best, simplest and most accurate beer search tool there is.    \n\n\n\n\nNew ALL BEER Finder App 'Quicksearch' \n \n\n \n\n\n\nHow does it work?    ALL BEER Finder uses a comprehensive and unique beer flavour database, populated with flavour evaluations by highly trained master sommeliers using the distinctive ALL BEER flavour template, developed by Alex Barlow when researching the ALL BEER Guide book. Alex re-invented the wheel of beer flavour identification and developed a beer evaluation template that identifies flavour characters, intensity and even relative flavour balance. \n\n\nTraditional Beer 'Flavour Wheel' \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nALL BEER Flavour Notepad example \n \n\n \n\n\nThe credibility of the template was confirmed by scientific studies at the International Centre for Brewing Science at Nottingham University, resulting in papers presented at the European, World Brewing Congress and American Society of Brewing Chemists.    \n\n\nWorld Brewing Congress poster presentation \n \n\n \n\n\nEach beer results in a minimum of 52 data-points of information, including qualitative information like specific aroma descriptors and suitable food pairings plus quantitative data such as relative intensity of aroma, taste and mouthfeel characteristics, flavour balance and overall Flavour intensity™ (Fi™).    If this sounds super-geeky, it is. But, this means we have great source data to enable our algorithms to select the perfect beer to suit your tastes using simple, intuitive search methods. Key Features: Search for beers using one or more of the following unique combination of methods: \nFree type text, e.g. a favourite flavour characteristic, a food you want to pair with, beer brand or even hop type \n% ABV range slider, select your desired alcohol range, e.g. 4-5.5% \nFi™ range slider, our unique 1-7 Flavour intensity™ scale, 1 = ultra-light, 7 = intense \nColour range slider, from white, through yellow, gold and amber to red, brown and black \n Further ‘Advanced search’ methods include: \nBitterness range slider, from low bitterness like light lager to high bitterness like IPA \nBalance range slider, from sweet, full or rounded, through balanced to more sour, bitter and challenging \nStyle selector. Pick from our list of major Ale, Lager and Lambic sour beer styles \nFormat selector. Pick the package formats appropriate to your needs \nBrewery facilities. Find breweries that offer a shop, tap room or food facilities \n Why we are different: ALL BEER Finder is different from other Apps because the beer flavour data is collated by independent evaluation from a highly trained flavour expert using a proven and consistent template (The ALL BEER Flavour Notepad) which collates both descriptive and numerical intensity data for identifiable flavour characters, meaning we have more usable and searchable data, and more methods to search - you search beer your way - by the features that are important to you, including desired food pairings! Stretch goals: Our initial fundraising target for developing the new website and App is a modest £12,000. However, if we exceed this amount, our stretch targets will allow us to add additional features to the App. These will include: \n\nGeolocation, search local breweries and where to find beers you like \nAbility to favourite beers and add own notes \nAndroid version of the App \nStyle guide and tasting information from the ALL BEER Guide book \n Timeline: \nKey project milestones: \nKickstarter starts \nKickstarter closes \nDistribute ALL BEER reward items \nCommence development of ALL BEER Management Portal \nTest and approve\nCommence development of allbeer.co.uk/ allbeerfinder.com websites \nCommence development of ALL BEER Finder App \nTest and approve \nDistribute Beta App- based reward items\nReview and revise \nFinal approval launch new allbeer.co.uk and ALL BEER Finder App\n \n Reward item images: £5 (c.$7.50) - ‘Thank You’ email with ALL BEER digital wallpaper designs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£10 (c.$15) - Beta version of the App with ‘Thank You’ email & ALL BEER digital wallpaper designs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£20 (c.$30) - Limited Edition 1/250 ‘I Kickstarted ALL BEER Finder App’ T-shirt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£30 (c.$45) - ALL BEER Experience \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£40 (c.$60) - One-of-a-kind ‘I Kickstarted ALL BEER Finder App’ T-shirt.

Risks and challenges Over and above the challenge of creating intuitive searches for all our great data and presented it in the clearest way possible, the principle risks and challenges are related to the website and app developers meeting the timelines stated. As many of the designs are already developed the most time consuming portion will be programming the algorithms which mine the information from the database. However, as we have a functioning website, there is a good basis to work from and improve. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story What is ArduRF? ArduRF is a wireless electronics development platform closely based on Arduino hardware.  The objectives are simple: \nTake the Pain out of Wireless Links \nTrue Arduino Compatibility \nLong Range AES-128 Encrypted Radio Link \nBattery Powered \nOperate from a Solar panel \n Why Another Wireless Arduino Project? Because it hasn't been done right yet.  I hope to change this for my backers and future customers.  Previous projects \nUse a different CPU \nDon't work from batteries \nCan't run all existing Arduino sketches \nAre not compatible with all the major operating systems.   \nCan not work in the 915MHz, 866MHz and 433MHz license free bands \nWere very far from production ready. \n We fixed all that. This project will ship the early bird reward within weeks of the funding of the project with an Atmega328p CPU, battery charger and radios on board. An Independent evaluator that has been testing the prototypes has reported a battery only powered ArduRf1s running for 80 hours sending a 40 byte message once every 5 seconds. This was done WITHOUT putting the ArduRf1s and the radio in Low Power Sleep mode. The ArduRF Family of Boards The ArduRF-family consists of three designs, each optimized for a different application environment. The ArduRF1 is a completely Arduino-compatible board.  It has the same shape, connectors and CPU as an Arduino Uno R3 and operates at 5V even when battery powered.  It has a LiPo battery charger and battery connector on board.  The integrated boost converter provides 5V when operating off the battery to maintain shield compatibility. \n\n\nThe ArduRF Family: Clockwise from the top left is the ArduRF1, PC2ArduRF and ArduRF1s. \n \n\n \n\n\nThe ArduRF1 and its CPU operates at 5V and 16MHz - even when running from the battery.  The ArduRF1 has the Arduino Uno form factor and uses the FTDI FT231 chip for the USB interface.  The form factor, pinout, CPU, and 5V operation ensures that the vast majority of shields will just work.    All the experience and working knowledge of Arduino's are directly applicable.  The standard IDE and examples continue to work without modification. \n\n\nMajor Functional Blocks of the ArduRF1 \n \n\n \n\n\nThe ArduRF1s is a smaller version of the design and maintains all of the features of the ArduRF1 except it operates at 3.3V.  All the pins available on an Arduino Uno are brought to connectors on the board edge .  The pin pitch is 0.1\" and the width is 0.8\" making it possible to mount the board on a solderless breadboard and still have two breadboard holes on each side available for connection to other devices. \n\n\nArduRF1s Front and Back \n \n\n \n\n\nThe third member of the ArduRF-family of boards is the PC2ArduRF1.  It is the smallest and lowest cost member of the family and is specifically designed to wirelessly connect a PC to one or more of the other ArduRF1 members. \n\n\nPC2ArduRF In the optional case \n \n\n \n\n\nRF Transceiver An off-the-shelf transceiver is used to minimize risk to the project.  The transceiver is available in three different frequency bands, 433MHz, 868MHz and 915MHz.  It has been tested on the first and second prototype (915MHz version only to stay legal) and found to have exceptional range more than 500m in an open field. (That is meters, not miles).  The data rate is adjustable up to 300kbps and the transceiver supports hardware AES encryption making the transmissions secure.  Simple wire monopoles are used as the antennas since they work well and there is no material benefit to using a manufactured antenna.  Wire antennas save the cost of the antenna and the RF-connector - which cost more than the antenna.   \nPower Management\n The ArduRF1 contains a lot of circuitry to sequence and select the power source for the CPU and transceiver.  The transceiver is a 3.3V circuit and a regulator is provided to power the transceiver.  Level shift IC's are used to convert the 3.3V signals to 5V. The main power input is a DC power jack followed by a switch mode power supply regulating the voltage to 5V.  A switch mode regulator was chosen to allow the battery to be charged from the DC input and to allow higher input voltages to be used without requiring a heatsink on the regulator.  The input voltage limit of the buck regulator is 42V.  The 42V input allows the ArduRF1 and ArduRF1s to be used in automobiles and on motorcycles without a pre-regulator.  This allows a low cost telemetry system to be designed around the ArduRF1(s) for racing cars and motorbikes.  A charger for a Lithium Polymer rechargeable cell provides 400mA of charge current to the cell and will automatically terminate the charging when the cell is fully charged.  The ArduRF1(s) is fully functional while the battery is being charged.   The LiPo cell has a varying terminal voltage depending on the remaining capacity.  For most of the discharge time of the battery the voltage will be approximately 3.7V but will fall to 2.9V before the battery protection circuit shuts down the ArduRF.  To power the ArduRF, the battery is connected to a boost converter to provide a steady 5V supply over the entire range of the battery voltage.  In the first prototype the regulator for the transceiver was powered directly from the battery.  In this version the transceiver regulator gets its input from the 5V rail.  The result is a small decrease in efficiency but the transceiver works optimally until the battery protection circuit shuts the system down.  In the first prototype the transceiver started to have a shorter range once the battery reached 3.4V.  This may be the exact time where the best range is needed to be sure that messages reporting the low battery condition get through. The ArduRF1(s) contains circuitry to select the correct power supply under all circumstances and this was one of the most challenging aspects of the design.  The ArduRF1(s) uses power from the available sources in this order: \nDC power jack, \nUSB input, \nThe rechargeable battery. \n The charger runs from the on board 5V and the 5V is provided by the buck regulator from the DC jack, the USB input, or the boost converter from the battery.  The battery charger does not try to charge the battery when the 5V comes from the battery via the boost regulator.   Some of the rewards include one or two LiPo cells capable of powering the ArduRF1 for an extended period.  Right now, I can't be more specific since the tests are ongoing.  The manufacturers label claims 1500mAh as the capacity for the cell but testing has shown the capacity to be closer to 1400mAh than 1500mAh.  None of the rewards contain more than two cells since that is the limit on the number of cells that can be mailed.  Solar Powered Wireless Arduino The ArduRF1 and ArduRF1s can operate from a DC input as high as 42V continuously, charge the battery at 400mA , power the transceiver and the CPU. \nYou can power the ArduRF1 and ArduRF1s from a 12V solar panel without problems where the voltage is all over the map from 0V at night to 18V or more during the day. When the solar power is there the battery will charge and the 5V or 3V will power the CPU, transceiver and auxiliary circuits.  When the sun sets or is obscured by clouds the LiPo cell will take over seamlessly.  The LiPo-cell offered with the rewards power the ArduRF1(s) continuously for 24 hours while the radio is transmitting.  Recharge time varies a bit with cell age but is around 3 hours from a fully discharged state.  Progress The first prototypes were designed, manufactured, tested and beaten up.  It had some issues that needed fixing.  Right now the (hopefully) final prototype set is undergoing evaluation by a select group of developers to verify that it works as intended, is truly compatible, and is mechanically sound. The ArduRF Prototypes Five prototypes have been manufactured to bring the design to its current state, three for the ArduRF1, and one each for the other two boards.  The other two designs were prototyped after the development of the ArduRF1 was complete and it was being tested.  Since they are subsets of the ArduRF1 - they worked straight out of the oven. The third ArduRF1 prototype has been manufactured to fix some minor issues regarding the legibility of the text once the connectors are installed. The connectors come very close to the text making the pin labels hard to read. The SP header pins were also not labeled in the first two prototypes. The position of the radio module was moved. A small change was made to the power switching circuitry to prevent two 5V supplies from being on at the same time. Occasionally, this lead to the boost converter supplying the circuit while the DC input was available. When fixing the silk screen lettering gets to the top of the list of things to fix on the PC board the the design is ready for production.   \n\n\n\n\nThree prototypes - first one at the top. \n \n\n \n\n\nOn the first prototype (at the top of the photo) the transceiver sits on stilts to verify that the ground plane on the PCB didn't interfere with the transceiver.  The raised transceiver did indeed have better performance than the transceivers mounted directly on the PCB showing that the ground plane did interfere with the operation of the transceiver.  The transceiver was moved and the ground plane was altered to ensure that the transceiver works correctly when soldered directly to the PCB.  You can also see that the reset switch migrated from its original position to the top left corner of the PCB.  In the original position it was too hard to reach when there was a full size shield stacked on top of the ArduRF1.  The LEDs for the battery charger and Tx/Rx indication was on the edge of the board of the first prototype but the standard Arduino LED was against the opposite edge of the board and almost all shields covered it.  The standard LED was also moved to the left edge of the board where it is more visible when the ArduRF1 is covered by a shield and positioned so that the other LEDs are visible. \n\n\nA great start! \n \n\n \n\n\nThe photograph above shows a PC2ArduRF next to an ArduRF1 showing the simplification of the design when the PC supplies regulated 5V.  The transceiver is soldered to the bottom of the PCB. Options PC2ArduRF The project started with a single ArduRF1 board.  I was asked numerous times for different versions of the main design.  Two options stood out: the first one is for a simplified version to allow a PC to communicate with the full blown ArduRF1.  Since it is tied to a PC it has no need for a battery charger or other supply since it can get its power directly from a USB port. The request was honored in the form of the PC2ArduRF.  To ensure it is compatible with all the major operating systems, the FTDI USB to serial interface is still on the board.  The module has a USB A-type connector to directly plug into a USB without the need for adaptors or cables.   \n\nAn optional plastic case is available to protect the PCB and the circuitry of the PC2ArduRF. \n\n\nPC2ArduRF next to a PC2ArduRF in the optional Case. \n \n\n \n\n\nSkinny ArduRF ArduRF1s breaks the shield compatibility and the 5V operation but offers a lower price and smaller form factor.  The ArduRF1s is the ArduRF1 without the boost DC-DC regulator and operates at 3.3V instead of 5V. It is much smaller than an Arduino board and is available at a lower price than the ArduRF1.  The CPU is still the Atmega328P and the FTDI USB interface is retained but the board is reduced down to  2.25 x 0.9 inch.  To save space (and money) the DC jack and boost converter was removed from the design.  The battery charger, USB interface, and the step down switcher remains on the design.  That means that voltage input range is still to 6V to 42V for the DC input and the full battery charge current is available over the entire input range. The battery will also charge when the ArduRF1s is connected via the USB plug.  Since the CPU operates at 3.3V the power management is much less complex than on the ArduRF1 resulting in major space savings and reduced design headaches. \n\n\nThe ArduRF1s. \n \n\n \n\n\n The ArduRF1s the preferred board for development where 5V operation is not required and space is at a premium.  The pin pitch of the connectors is 0.1\" for ease of use. What remains to be done is to buy boards in large panels to simplify the production.  The first and second ArduRF1 prototypes were made on panels to allow the production reflow solder profile to be developed and to verify that the boards build and solder correctly.  I also experimented with soldering the transceiver at the same time as the rest of the components using lower melting point solder paste.  The experiments were successful but it turns out that the transceiver interferes with the programming of the boot loader software so that option was abandoned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the project is funded and the designs are finalized they will be published online for download.  I will publish the complete schematics as PDF files.  I will publish the PCB layout as Gerber files.  Unfortunately I don't use any of the hardware tools commonly used by the Arduino community so my source files are in the proprietary formats used by Pads and OrCad.  If someone volunteers to capture the design in an open tool such as KiCad I will be more than happy to verify the schematic files and netlist against the actual PCB and then we can verify the new PCB against the KiCad schematic.  The designs are published under a Creative Commons License.   Rewards The rewards consist of various combinations of the ArduRF family of boards.  To keep the list of rewards manageable the various radio frequency options are not listed separately and the user choice will be determined after the pledges are made.  Please note that I have no plan on shipping 433MHz radios to US and Canadian addresses since that option is not legal.  The default option is the 915MHz/868MHz radio.  The transceiver works well at both frequencies as long as the antenna is trimmed to the correct length.  European users should program the radio for 868MHz and North American users should use the transceiver at 915MHz.  Please also note that the encryption may be disabled and it may be necessary to disable the encryption to remain legal.  Model rocketeers please pay special attention to your hobby's restrictions on the use of radio links. All rewards include a pair of transceivers since these boards are mostly useless without two boards and two transceivers.  User who may want us the ArduRF boards without the receiver will have to buy from my web site or Tindie once the Kickstarter is over.  \n\n\nPopular Rewards \n \n\n \n\n\nWhy Kickstarter? The short answer is that development costs money and this design has been unusually expensive to bring to this stage. What started out as a project to make an Arduino clone with a good, long range radio link morphed into a family of products.  One design is now three and the costs have multiplied accordingly.  To offer the Lithium Polymer cell at a reasonable price I have to buy a very substantial number of cells.  Most factories have a 3000 piece minimum order quantity and the large number of cells has to be shipped as 'hazardous goods'.  This alone makes buying less than several hundred cells at a time prohibitively expensive. I will build the design in the USA on my own equipment to ensure a high quality product.  To keep the price reasonable the amount of labor going into each board has to be kept to a bare minimum.  On the prototypes the DC power connector was placed by hand because I don't have the correct feeder for a part this large.  Pick and Place machines use feeders to position the part to be picked from a precisely known position and orientation.  I have feeders for many standard parts but not for the DC power jack.  Feeders are precision engineered and cost a lot of money.  It is not uncommon to invest more money in feeders than in the Pick and Place machine itself.  Since the project grew in scale I am now short of essentially all feeder sizes.  A few more feeders will allow me to build all three boards in quick succession without having to remove reels from feeders and load different reels in the same feeders. The next financial outlay is to pay for reasonable quantities of the components.  Although most components can be bought in quantities smaller than full reels the cost can be prohibitive.  Someone must count the parts at the supplier and put them on reels.  This all goes into higher prices for small orders.  For small orders the shipping cost makes up a much larger percentage of the overall cost than for larger orders. If this Kickstarter is wildly successful - I will have to add to the workforce to be able to ship on time.  With your support I hope to bring a truly Arduino compatible product to market with a great radio link at an affordable price.  Please help make this project wildly successful by telling 5000 of your closest friends about it and urge them to back it. Risks and challenges The biggest risk to a timely conclusion of the project and delivery of the rewards is unexpected component shortages. The Atmel CPU is notorious for becoming scarce and expensive but presently the distributors are well stocked. None of the single source parts are difficult to find from multiple distributors. Parts were chosen where numerous distributors carry stock over lower cost parts that have single suppliers. I have a reasonable stock of CPUs on hand and will add to my stock if I see supplier stock run low or shortages are reported.\n\nAnother risk to timely delivery is equipment failure since I have only one set of assembly equipment. My Pick and Place machine and Reflow Oven are both made in the USA and are about one year old. Most spare parts are available with only a short lead time but if a major sub-system were to fail it may take as long as six weeks to obtain a replacement. In the event of such a failure I will sub-contract the assembly of the PCBs to someone (already identified) that has the same equipment as I do.\n\nEven in the event of a runaway success of the Kickstarter the production is unlikely to overwhelm our capability to assemble and test the boards due to the capacity limitation of the production equipment. It may however become necessary to work an extra shift to keep to the promised delivery dates and that will incur extra labor costs. It is likely that the extra costs will be offset by the reductions in the component prices and PCB costs and by operating a production line for testing instead of the batch testing currently envisaged.

    "textDescription": "Story About this Project Despite being the fifth largest religion in the world, many Americans have little to no knowledge about Sikhism. The lack of familiarity makes this foreign religion seem alien and other, causing there to be a sense of anxiety associated with Sikhism.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis documentary is an exploration of Sikhism through a handful of followers during the festival of Hola Mohalla. Who are the Nihang, who uphold the tradition of the armed Sikh order? Why do they feel it’s important to continue this warrior legacy of sword fighting and horsemanship, which no longer functions in modern warfare? What is it like to be a woman practicing Sikhism, a religion that is one of the most progressive in its stance toward women’s rights, but when practiced in the real world functions very differently? How do the children, or the next generation feel about the faith? These are the important questions this documentary seeks to answer by interacting with followers at Hola Mohalla. Religion is rarely explained in such personal terms, through the voice of followers; these people become a link to a religion that many aren’t aware of. The followers are what make the religion come alive, rather than being an assortment of purely theoretical or theological concepts.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HOLA MOHALLA documentary looks at how followers of a faith deal with modernity, with hate, and with idealist ideas versus real world application, all of which is magnified to extremes during the festival. Through the eyes of a Nihang, a woman, a volunteer, a pilgrim, a descendant of the ruling class, and a few others, we reveal Sikhism as a religion of “soldier saints.” What is Hola Mohalla Hola Mohalla is an annual festival held at Anandpur Sahib. It was started by Guru Gobind Singh, as a gathering of Sikhs for military exercises and mock battles on the day following the Indian festival of Holi. The mock battles were followed by music and poetry competitions. Harsangat Raj Kaur Allow me to introduce our main pilgrim: Harsangat Raj Kaur. She is the first Sikh woman to participate in the shows of horsemanship at Hola Mohalla in over 300 years. She will also be teaching the lost are of mounted archery, so that it may return to a culture that has a warrior tradition. Her relationship with Sikhism is complex, as she converted in America, in her 20’s. Sikhism is rooted so deeply in her life, now, that it seems she must have been Sikh in a past life. But studying Sikhism, through the Guru Granth Sahib without the context of Punjab, or India, proves idealistic ideas may not be able to withstand the influence of the surrounding culture. Sikh women are not always treated as equals or with respect. Harsangat has rode and trained to raise awareness of the oppression many women face. Her unique, faith journey inspires education and awareness about Sikhism, while also representing female empowerment \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy this story matters We are currently fighting a battle against the most hate crimes that have occurred since 9/11. This ignorance filled violence is a call to educate those who find our differences scary. This film has the ability to reach out and entertain and educate at the same time. Show that we are not that different, that the doctrine of Sikhism is one of peace and equality. We believe that we all worship the same God, just a little differently. HOLLA MOHALLA gives a voice to the voiceless.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What we need Even if it's just a small amount - everything counts and helps us to achieve our goal. We are thankful for every single one of our backers. Some of you might not be able to contribute money to our project. That is totally fine. But that doesn't mean you can't help at all! Here's what else you can do to support our documentary: Tell all of your friends!  Share on Facebook!   Tweet about it!  Blog it! Thanks SO much! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges There are always challenges when producing a movie. Funding falls through, locations back out and editing can take longer than expected.\n\nYour generous donations ensure that we stick to our schedule and complete each stage efficiently and on time.\n\nWe have applied for a number of grants from the government as well as confirmed funding from private donors. The producers do not use any of the money to pay themselves. Every dollar raised goes directly towards production or post-production.\n\nWe promise to be as cost effective as possible while working on this independent film.

    "textDescription": "Story Echoshed is a collective of like-minded musicians, dedicated to the performance of contemporary music. They seek to discover and champion new musical styles, to experiment, to challenge existing models of concert performance and to connect their output with other art forms.  Their ‘cause and effect’ concert will explore the reactionary impulses we all feel when we listen to music, with an immersive visual display which is dictated by the music as it happens live. WE NEED YOU On Friday 28th April, at Hackney Attic, we are bringing together live contemporary-classical music and interactive visual electronics to create the ultimate concert experience. Backers will be funding the venue hire, promotional material and administrative costs for this concert. Any profits made above our target will be recycled into future projects and events. As the performers are all recent graduates from the Royal College of Music, London, our promise is to give concerts to a very high standard. By supporting this project, you are also supporting the arts on a local level, which is important at a time when funding for classical music is critically low. Please pledge what you can afford, and make contact with Michael McGeary to claim tickets and to receive full concert details. E-mail: michaelmcgeary@msn.com Risks and challenges There will always be risks when planning a live music concert, and now that we aim to incorporate live visuals this will add a new level to the planning process. However, we pride ourselves on professionalism and rehearse together often to produce high quality concert experiences. Our previous concerts to date have been of great success.\n\nOur concert date is set, therefore there will be no delays to this project.

In these pages, he embarks on an\nearnest, touching, at times comical journey to discover the places where we\nfeel most connected as human beings – to each other, to nature, and to the\nworld around us. From the bottom of a bomb crater in Laos, to a refugee camp on\nthe Sudanese border, to the side of a Panamanian volcano, and back home again\nto the frozen January streets of Minneapolis, Here is Where We Meet is a\nmoving, intensely personal exploration of shared experience and unlikely\nintersection. The Humble Request: \n\nSo, we’re a start up. Like really, really a start up. All we've got are some words on paper and a desire to put them out\ninto the world in the hopes that a few others will be inspired to do the same.\nWe’ve also got a few talented artisans in our midst, who we’d love to be able\nto pay a few dollars to do things like book design and layout, copy-editing, and promotion. We also have to cover the trade paperback printing and e-book digital conversion costs. Your pledge will go directly to these needs. Project Timeline: We're planning to submit the finished manuscript in mid-September to CreateSpace for the trade paperback printing and distribution and to BookBaby for all of the digital conversion and distribution (Kindle, Nook, iBook, etc.) October and November will be spent on final tweaks and edits, and we plan to officially release the book the first week of December.

WHISTLER IS... 1 - LESS PRODUCT, MORE CARE: A perfectly balanced lineup of multi-purpose shower essentials to start your day off better. 2 - DEEPER CLEAN: Ultra premium ingredients, high-powered botanicals and no fillers. 3 - ZERO TOXINS: A healthy alternative that to the hidden evils currently hiding in your soap dish. 4 - SCENT DESIGNED FOR FOCUS: A memorable fragrance - Campfire and Cut Grass - formulated to invigorate and clear your mind. 5 - DOES GOOD: A proven way to leave our coastlines and waterways better tomorrow than they are today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've stripped out the skin-drying parabens and sulphates to create a naturally derived 2-in1-Shampoo, an All-Over Body Wash, and a moisturizing Face and Body Bar, that vow never to use ocean-clogging micro-beads or hidden toxins. Each is packed with nature's highest powered botanicals and a scent guaranteed to inspire. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt starts with a feeling; The kind of mindfulness and in-the-moment living that comes when we step outside of our normal routine to connect with something real, deeper, more natural.  When we checked the labels on the products in our bathroom, we were anything but inspired; toxins, additives, products that do too little or strip away too much, and a routine that feels frantic and cluttered or incomplete. Whistler intends to change that. Our line of multi-functional products is designed to get you through a complete care routine with ease. Built using premium, naturally derived bases and high-powered botanicals, Whistler offers a deeper, more natural clean and a manly scent that sets the pace for a clear-thinking, more productive day. Take a breath. Make the choice. Connect with what matters most. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 years ago Flint and Tinder - an American Made clothing line born on Kickstarter - started shipping bars of a custom-made soap featuring a uniquely masculine fragrance. The logic was simple; by bathing orders (and customers) in a scent designed to trigger thoughts of adventure and the outdoors, the brand and the men who use it would would embody that spirit. \nIt worked! For almost 3 years, Campfire and Cut Grass soap was among Flint and Tinder's very top sellers. 25,000+ bars and just as many satisfied customers later, the Whistler team was on the hunt for a scent that accomplished all of those same goals. Instead of re-creating what was already done, we reached out to ask if we could expand on the idea. They agreed on one condition: We commit to making the complete line of soaps, washes and shampoos in America. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the Whistler team, it was a no brainer: Buying American is important to keeping friends and families working and our economy on top. If each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufactured using World War II era machinery, our tumblers are double dipped at the lip to put up with a lifetime of wear and tear. Perfectly scaled to fit several toothbrushes, toothpaste and more. It's the ideal way to leave things neat and tidy on your counter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we do it? Simple. Core to Whistler's mission is making time to give back and clean-up. Each bottle sold supports that mission as we're partnering with top environmental non-profits and rolling up our sleeves to remove debris from America's coast lines and waterways. We'd love it if you joined us.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this project, we've partnered with the Connecticut River Watershed Council to point us in an environmentally friendly direction and make sure we actively protect and clean-up our priceless waterways.

CRWC believes in Hard work, Real fun, True impact and so does Whistler. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In addition to keeping you in the loop about product launches, clean-up efforts and more, we'll be sure you're among the first to know if we ever offer samples so you can get in on the action! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne 12oz ALL OVER WASH (Deep Clean + Re-Animator) with Baobab, Eucalyptus and Cucumber Extracts ...

We'll make sure the person you're buying for gets a message before the big day. Stay tuned for the link to an e-card that you can easily send to the receiver of your Whistler gift! \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The Whistler team is made up of a former brand and product manager at one of the largest personal goods companies on earth, two soap factories (one of which had previously manufactured 25,000+ bars of soap for Flint and Tinder), a fragrance engineer, one of the top formulators on the East Coast and Jake Bronstein, founder of Flint and Tinder who has overseen the successful delivery of four Kickstarter projects to date. \n\nWe all came together with a singular passion - to deliver a deeper, more natural clean than anything else on the market and to inspire others to slow down and focus.\n\nTrue, anything can (and likely will) happen between the project's close and ultimately delivering the product... but we'd like to think with such an experienced team of experts in our corner, a proven track record of success, and a bit of padding on the timeline, we should be able to resolve whatever issues arise.\n\nNOW THE FINE PRINT: Whistler Wash Co is a limited liability corporation independently owned and operated from the Flint and Tinder brand line of goods and products.

Our goal is not to add to this chatter, but to help in the best way we know: Empowering communities to collect data of what's actually happening in their environment . \n\nSimply put, we invite you to participate in the deployment of a crowdsourced, interactive, worldwide environmental database — the largest to date!   Want to get involved? Read on! What is the Smart Citizen Kit? The Smart Citizen Kit is an Open-Source platform that comprises 3 technological layers: a hardware device, a website and online API, and a mobile app. Below is an overview of them, and if you're interested, all the gory details can be found on the Smart Citizen website .  Arduino-compatible hardware The first layer is a piece of hardware comprised by two printed-circuit boards: an interchangeable daughterboard or shield, and an arduino-compatible data-processing board. We have nicknamed the shield developed for this campaign 'The Ambient Board.'  As the name suggests, it carries sensors that measure air composition (CO and NO2), temperature,  light intensity, sound levels,  and humidity . Once it’s set up, the ambient board is able to stream data measured by the sensors over Wi-Fi using the FCC-certified, wireless module on the data-processing board. The device’s low power consumption allows for placing it on balconies and windowsills.  Power to the device can be provided by a solar panel and/or battery .  All the design files (schematics and PCB layout) for this Open-Source , Arduino-compatible device are available on our Github repository . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual assembled boards shown from our pre-production run. \n \n\n \n\n Currently, we are hard at work designing additional shields for use in soil and water testing for urban agriculture (in collaboration with Refarm The City ), measuring electromagnetic fields, tracking energy consumption and air composition inside the home, and even monitoring biometrics. \nThe website and online API \n The online component of the Smart Citizen Kit is used for logging and visualizing the data measured by the hardware.  Once the device is set up, you can navigate to the website and visualize your measurements, share your data with others, and view what other users in your community or around the world are reporting.  You can also query our Application Programming Interface (API) to instantly access the datastream from your device(s).  Although we don't mind writing detailed explanations of all the features, we think it best to show them to you!   Check out the live (Beta) site at http://test.smartcitizen.me . \n\n\nActual screenshot from our live (Beta) site. For more details visit http://acrobotic.com/smart-citizen/web \n \n\n \n\n The online component of the Smart Citizen Kit combines a few different components featuring OpenStreetMap (The Free Wiki World Map); the JavaScript libraries Leaflet, Raphaël, and jQuery; and the PHP framework CakePHP.  Similar to the other components of the Smart Citizen Kit, the website and online API are Open-Source and available on our Github repository . \nThe mobile app (under active development) \n The third layer of the project is a mobile app, which allows you to communicate with the physical hardware over an easy-to-use, native application on your smartphone. \n\n\nUser Interface wireframes of the Smart Citizen Kit mobile app. See an actual demo a few paragraphs below. For more details visit http://acrobotic.com/smart-citizen/app \n \n\n \n \nAdditional resources Hands-on workshop.   We provide the exclusive opportunity to our Kickstarter backers to come to sunny Pasadena, California (U.S. backers), or beautiful Barcelona, Catalonia (European backers) for a day of tinkering with your Smart Citizen Kit.  We will show you the ropes!  Everything from making your own hardware, to exploring all the different features of the website, online API, and mobile app.  The workshop includes a local tour of the gorgeous Caltech (Pasadena) or IAAC (Barcelona) campuses, as well as lunch and refreshments.  For out-of-town backers, some of the rewards include airfare, lodging, and airport transportation. \n\n\n\nA subset of our campaign rewards include the opportunity to participate in a Hands-on workshop and tour! \n \n\n \n\nOnline forum.   Of course, this project would not be complete without an online (multilingual) forum , which is moderated by our team members.  This is the easiest avenue for asking questions, and reading other users' experiences.

Version controlled repositories.   All three technological layers of the Smart Citizen Kit are Open-Source, and thus all the files we use for development and manufacturing of the Kit are readily available on our Github repository . Present & Future of the Smart Citizen project  (what your  $, £, ¥, €, … are actually funding!) After successfully putting the Smart Citizen Kit in the hand of over 150 users around Barcelona, Spain , we are ready for the next, and most crucial step. \n\n\nThe Smart Citizen Kit: conceived out of Fab Lab Barcelona, in collaboration with Barcelona-based arts production center Hangar, and the interaction design studio MID. \n \n\n \n\nWe want to build a distributed data-collection network through the worldwide deployment of the Smart Citizen Kit, and... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo purchase components for the hardware in large quantities  As most of you know, the only way we can offer the Smart Citizen Kit hardware at a reasonable price is by purchasing its components in large quantities.  Specifically, in order to purchase turn-key PCBs and afford to sell assembled Kits for $150, we need to purchase at least 300 units from our PCB assembly house.  That is why we've set our financial goal at $50,000 (amount includes processing fees). \n\n\nPre-production run of the Smart Citizen hardware used for our Beta release in Barcelona, Spain. \n \n\n \n\nTo provide quality assurance and customer support We are hoping with this campaign to extend our user-base by at least 300 individuals.  Such scaling effort requires us to hire additional labor for testing and packaging the hardware kits.  In addition, given the magnitude of the project and our commitment to customer satisfaction, it also require us to hire virtual assistants for supporting users on our online platform, answering questions through our mailing list, and monitoring our multilingual forum . \n\n\nActual testing of the Smart Citizen Hardware during the pre-production run. \n \n\n \n\nTo finalize our 3D-printable enclosure design We are redesigning the enclosure of the Smart Citizen, to increase its resilience and make it more aesthetically pleasing.  We'll be starting the testing and pre-production of these enclosures over the next couple of weeks (we'll keep you informed through our campaign updates!).  The CAD files for the enclosure are Open-Source, and will be available on our Github repository . To finalize our mobile app The initial functionality of the Smart Citizen mobile app is implemented for iOS.  The video below demonstrates basic communication between an iPhone and a Smart Citizen Kit.  With your financial support we'll be able to refine the app, and add additional features. ============================================================== New Video of the latest Smart Citizen App functionality! \n============================================================== \n\n\n\n\n\nTo accelerate the development of additional shields In addition to 'The Ambient Board' developed for this campaign, we are already working on additional shields for use in urban agriculture, measuring electromagnetic fields, tracking energy consumption and air composition inside the home, and even monitoring biometrics.\n \n\n\nAdditional shields already under development, stay tuned for updates on the progress! \n \n\n \n\nStretch Goals Any additional funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign will allow us to expand our development team, and tackle the next set of goals for the Smart Citizen project at a much quicker pace.   ============================================================== EDIT: $60,000: If we reach this financial goal — thanks to our wonderful Kickstarter backers — we'll be able to work on the Android App sooner, and have a version out by the time the hardware is shipped! [REACHED!] EDIT: $70,000:  If we reach this financial goal — thanks to our wonderful Kickstarter backers — we'll be able to subcontract additional developers to finish the design of the urban agriculture and electromagnetic shields quicker, and thus be able to include them as part of this campaign's rewards. ============================================================== $85,000:  If we reach this financial goal — thanks to our wonderful Kickstarter backers — we'll be able to subcontract even more additional developers to finish the design of the energy consumption tracking and indoor-air monitoring shields quicker, and thus be able to include them as part of this campaign's rewards.

We have completed a small pre-production run, which allowed us to receive early feedback over 150 users. In addition, as several team members have been successful in previous crowdfunding efforts — both inside and outside Kickstarter — we are very aware of additional challenges that may be encountered.\n\nRisk #1: lead time and delays of hardware components. \nWe've done our homework. We maintain a global inventory (updated daily) of the parts needed for the production of the Smart Citizen Kit hardware. Our main concern is to be able to fulfill the orders we take during the campaign, for this we have limited the number of Hardware Rewards we offer, we have also set realistic timelines for delivering the kits based on an already completed pre-production run, and, we have prepared for the scenario where we run out of the first offering of our Hardware Rewards (in such case, we'll offer additional kits with a delivery date that accounts for the components' lead time).\n\nRisk #2: problems with the assembly of the hardware. \nThis was one of the main reasons that motivated our pre-production run and Beta release, it allowed us to test the capabilities of our hardware manufacturer. With a couple of lessons learned, we now feel more than confident on meeting the expectations of a larger audience. Since the manufacturer has already completed a couple of runs for us, there will be no surprises in this step of the process.\n\nRisk #3: problems with the website and online API. \nThis was an area where we definitely learned valuable lessons during the Beta release. One of the main challenges we faced was scalability of the online platform. As a result, we have taken the necessary measures to guarantee the best User Experience when using this tool. We have upgraded the virtual servers to attain better performance, and we are also upgrading our Mapbox accounts to avoid any limitation on the number of prints per day imposed on standard ones.\n\nRisk #4: not reaching our financial goal.\nThis is a challenge inherent to the crowdfunding process. We are determined to get these Kits into people's hands around the world, even if we fail at reaching our financial goal. In this case, we'll adjust our hardware manufacturing process (assembling the boards manually) in order to lower our production costs.\n\nOf course, it'd be ludicrous to think that we can reduce to 4 the risks associated with production and deployment of any hardware project. We are committed to working as hard as necessary to ensure nothing but the best experience to our wonderful backers :) Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

It is the tale of a lovable alligator who secretly stows away with a family after a chance encounter during their Florida vacation. The colorful story is told in amusing verses and packed with twenty gorgeous illustrations that will captivate and entertain readers of all ages. This is the \" inaugural\"  first  printing of Dozi the Alligator . It will be a  high-quality, hardcover,  numbered,  limited edition.

In \n2010 I was very fortunate and honored to have my comic strip, \"Hoxwinder\n Hall\", voted a Top-5 finalist in the Washington Post's \"America's Next \nGreat Cartoonist\" contest. That bit of success gave me the confidence to\n launch the strip as a web-comic, which eventually lead to it being \npicked up for print syndication in parts of the United States and \nCanada. At the heart of my comic is a little alligator named \n\"Dozi\". It didn't take long to realize that Dozi resonated with readers,\n and that got me thinking about how much a younger audience would REALLY\n love him! So I created a children's book that tells the story of how \nDozi meets Byron Hoxwinder (the little boy and the other main character in\n the comic strip). And here we are! \"Dozi the Alligator\" is \nbasically a Prologue to my comic strip.

    "textLength": 5771,
    "textDescription": "Story The Project: The purpose of this project is to create an expanded version of a prototype Operation Spring High video using commercially licensed software and make the documentary available to the public.  Operation Spring High was the first counter-air mission against Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites in the history of aerial warfare. On 27 July, 1965, 46 pilots flew this historical mission. I have joined together with  John MacKay, an accomplished animator, to create an animated film that will provide a highly accurate documentary of what led up to this mission, how it was executed, and the devastating results. The attack portion of the mission was flown so low that some enemy defenses initially were unable to lower their anti-aircraft-artillery (AAA) sufficiently to aim directly at the attacking aircraft.   In spite of a majority of the flak bursting above the F-105s, six F-105 aircraft were lost, with three pilots killed, two taken prisoner, and one rescued. This film will fill a void in visual documentation of this disastrous mission, preserve historical facts for future generations, and be a tribute to the 28 pilots still living of the 46 who flew the mission. The Project Team: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVic Vizcarra is a native of Los Angeles, CA, now residing in Ramona, CA. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree from Loyola University of Los Angeles and was commissioned in the U.S. Air Force through the ROTC program. He served 24 years in the Air Force and is a combat veteran of the Spring High mission. He has developed the video storyboard and will be the technical advisor and co-producer of the video. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn MacKay was born in Dallas, Texas, to two RCAF veterans. He grew up in Ohio and graduated from the Columbus College of Art and Design, majoring in Illustration. He served in the U.S. Navy on the USS Wabash. In the late 1990's he worked with the Wolfpack development team at computer game publisher, Eidos Interactive in the San Francisco area. John MacKay has already created a prototype video as a proof of concept using license free modeling software for Vic Vizcarra's personal use. Samples of his videos can be seen at: Xeidos2's channel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Maik Donath is a German National who will be subcontracted to develop the weapons explosions files. He studied at the Werner-von-Siemens School for Media Art and Sound Design at Frankfurt and specializes in various special effects animation renderings with skills in low/high hard surface modeling, shading/texturing effects, and particle and fluid effects. Additionally, he is a self taught 3d Generalist artist and was an understudy of several experienced professional animators while working animation films. Samples of his various projects/works can be seen at: https://vimeo.com/98221991 \nProject Schedule: It is estimated that creation of an approximate 40 minute \"Operation Spring High\"  video will take from eight to twelve months once the project is funded. How Will the Funding be Used: The funds will finance the project in the following categories: Hardware and commercially licensed software purchases; Animation subcontract for development of weapons explosive software models; Awards procurement, shipping and handling; Initial DVD production for Backers; Kickstarter fees and Collection fees; Partial salary for animator. Total funds required: $9,915.  Funds exceeding the goal will be applied to further software upgrades above initial plans and added salary for John MacKay who is creating the video at a rate 80% lower than the animation industry standard. Backer Awards: Backers will be able to immediately monitor project progress through a project website and download wallpaper files of some of the video scenes to their personal computer once the project is funded. All backers at the $15 dollar level or above will receive a DVD copy of the finished video upon project completion. All other awards will be shipped between 60 to 90 days after the project is funded. Samples of Other Backer Awards: 3d Major Command and Squadron Logos of Spring High Participants. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          PACAF 3d Logo on the left, TAC 3d Logo on the right.   \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Top: 12th TFS and 357th TFS Logos.                         Bottom: 563rd TFS and 80th TFS Logos \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\" x 20\" print of Rambler Flight attacking the 63rd Missile Battalion SAM site Support facilities (signed and unsigned). Prints are Computer Generated Images (CGI) created by John MacKay and are representative of scenes to be developed for the Spring High video.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Healy Rooster Tails\" 16\"x 20\" print showing Healy flight kicking up rooster tails in their low level high speed dash over Red River Valley rice paddies as they head towards the 64th Missile Battalion SAM Site 6.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited Executive Producer Certificate, numbered and with the Backers name will be individually signed by six Spring High Pilots (Limited to 12 Backers)   Project Inquires: Address further questions regarding this project to Vic Vizcarra at vizcarras105@cox.net with the subject line, Kickstarter Operation Spring High Project. Risks and challenges This is a very low risk project. John MacKay is an experienced animator with ten flight simulation videos based on actual aviation events, including the Spring High prototype simulation, to his credit. He produced the prototype Spring High video using license free software restricted for his and my personal use. The only potential risk is possible slippage in the completion schedule due to unforeseen factors. Nonetheless, once funded, the project will be started and completed.

    "textDescription": "Story To purchase the EP, click here . Sometimes people ask me why I write songs. Honestly, I don't really know. Sometimes it's like pulling teeth. Sometimes the songs write themselves. Usually, though, it feels like an itch that can only be scratched by getting the song out and into the open...but in a good way. \nI have a band. We are Jealous Creatures, and that is also our name. There's Josh on drums, Lisa on bass and cello, and Rob on keyboards. I cannot reiterate enough how essential my band members are to these songs. If you see me at an open mic and I'm playing by myself, the songs sound cute. With these guys, the songs sound awesome. To me, making music has always been a team effort, and when the team changes, the music changes, too. I know this sounds cheesy, but each individual brings a little piece of themselves and puts it into every song...and when you listen to them, you can really hear it. \nI'm trying to find my voice as a musician. There are better song writers, and there are better guitar players, and there are better singers, but I think I'm not too bad in each category, and that has been enough encouragement to get me to where I am today. I'm out of college (finally) and I have some time to sit down and actually see if this can go anywhere. I think it would be cool if my music could take me somewhere, like, career-wise, but I'm more interested in seeing whether or not the music simply resonates with other people. \nAnd I guess that brings us here: I'm also trying to figure out if we should even record this album. Call it pragmatism, call it low-self confidence: whatever. The point is that if nobody wants to listen to it, then there is no reason to record it. That's where you come in: by contributing, you let me know whether or not there is a demand for what we do. If there's not, then there's not and I'll do something else and get on with my life, but if there is -- and I hope there is -- I want to make sure that our music is getting to the people who want to hear it. \nThe contributions that you make will go towards recording costs and CD production. There are a variety of rewards that we're offering as well, from buttons, stickers, and completed CDs to free admission to shows for a year to us recording a cover song of your choosing and sending it just to you. There is a lot more cool stuff to be had, so be sure to check every contribution level to see all the things we are offering. \nMusic is definitely a team effort, and basically, I guess that I'm asking you to be on my team. If we sound like something you are interested in listening to, then please contribute. If the songs strike a chord with you, let other people know about our project. There will be no debut CD without your help, so please remember that each and every contribution matters, no matter the size. Whatever you can give is a great help. \nThank you so much for taking the time to watch this video.

    "textDescription": "Story What is Dodo Ink? \n Dodo Ink is a new indie publishing company which aims to publish 3 to 4 books a year. These novels will be bold, daring, risky but accessible literary novels. The sort of books big publishers used to take a risk on but don’t any more. Who We Are So far our Dodo Ink team consists of 3. Thom Cuell is a passionate book reviewer and book blogger who has been championing literary fiction for several years. You can visit his much-loved book blog The Workshy Fop here. He is also the reviews editor for the literary magazine The Cadaverine and has written for The Weeklings and The Literateur. \nSam Mills is an award-winning novelist published by Faber and Corsair/Little Brown. Her latest novel, The Quiddity of Will Self , was published in 2012 to fine reviews in The Sunday Time s and The Guardian . She has been a freelance editor for the last 4 years and has written over a hundred editorial reports for agencies such as Writer’s Workshop and The Literary Consultancy. She will be editing the books we buy.\nAlex Spears has plenty of experience in the book industry, having worked in digital and marketing roles at various independent presses, including Constable & Robinson, Pluto Press and Elliott & Thompson. He currently works for the digital publishing start-up, Papertrell.  We’re all passionate about publishing the type of books we’d love to curl up with ourselves. Our favourite reads include The Raw Shark Texts by Steven Hall, F by Daniel Kehlmann and Lightning Rods by Helen DeWitt. We hope to publish books as daring and inventive and interesting as these. \n\n\nThe Dodo Ink team plots world domination \n \n\n \n\n\n The Books We Plan to Publish  Dodo Ink plans to publish 3 to 4 literary novels a year. We’re fundraising for our first 3 publications of 2016. These are Dodge and Burn by Seraphina Madsen, Wood Green by Sean Rabin, and The Eleventh Letter by Tom Tomaszewski. You can download the first chapters of their novels on our website: www.dodoink.com  Dodge and Burn will be our first novel. We discovered Seraphina after reading her brilliant short story for The White Review , which you can take a look at here . Her novel is a wild, psychedelic tale about two girls growing up in South America, after their mother is killed by a bee attack. The surreal imagination of her work is rendered in beautifully crafted prose. There aren’t many female novelists who cite their main influences as Hunter S Thompson, Carlos Castaneda and William Burroughs.  Wood Green centres on a young would-be novelist called Michael who takes up the job as secretary to Lucian Clarke, an internationally renowned author. Clarke had once travelled the world living a life like Hemingway but now lives as a recluse in his hometown of Wood Green, Tasmania. Both men, the young apprentice and the aging master, have hidden agendas of their own; as their relationship evolves and their true aims are revealed, the novel builds to a surprising and surreal climax. This is a captivating story of literary obsession, reminiscent of Twin Peaks in its depiction of small-town life.  The Eleventh Letter by Tom Tomaszewski is a literary ghost story. Think Susan Hill crossed with David Lynch. It centres on a psychotherapist who is looking back to a murder case he dealt with 20 years earlier in Italy. Tom himself is a Harley Street psychotherapist, so he is writing from experience; he has also reviewed and written for The Independent on Sunday , where he interviewed various writers including Christine Brook-Rose. Why We Need Funding   We’re an indie press but we want to give each book the big treatment. In recent, recession-averse times bigger publishers have been known to put out a dozen titles in a month, wait to see what starts to take off and then back it. We don’t want to adopt this sort of strategy. We want to give each book full support before it takes off, because we’re proud to publish our authors and want them to be read as widely as possible. Therefore, much of our Kickstarter will go on printing proof copies for review, getting the book into the hands of booksellers, journalists, book bloggers and anyone passionate about books (i.e. YOU), marketing and digital marketing campaigns, as well as getting some sumptuous covers designed.  We've all been working unpaid on Dodo Ink for nearly a year, supporting ourselves with other work. We're all doing this for the love of it. So every penny of this kickstarter will go on our authors and their books; we'll take nothing for ourselves. Why Dodo Ink? The 3 of us can’t make this project happen by ourselves. Over the past few years, indie presses have been the ones putting out the most exciting books, and often those which end up winning prizes – some fine examples include A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing by Eimear McBride, by Galley Beggar Press; Remainder by Tom McCarthy, which was published by a small French arts press after being rejected by all the big publishers in the UK; the Booker shortlisted title The Garden Of Evening Mists by Tan Twan Eng; The Wake by Paul Kingsnorth, which was crowdsourced and published by Unbound and longlisted for the Booker and shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize (all rejected by all the main UK publishers).  The samples above illustrate that many authors who are writing anything just a little bit different or risky aren’t be picked up by the mainstream anymore. Indeed, in a recent article for The Daily Telegraph , Jonathan Cape’s editorial director declared that publishers simply can’t risk putting out these type of books anymore – leaving it to small presses to take the risk.  However, this is slightly depressing news for the future of publishing, and we’re convinced that there are numerous readers out there who don’t want to just read a thriller or a reading group book that is like everything else out there.\nWe’d therefore like you to join us in creating a company that will take those risks and get those exciting books into your hands. We’d like to offer you a range of special gifts, from ebooks to signed first editions, to bottles of Dodo ink and Dodo feather quills, invites to our launch parties and the chance to meet us and our authors. We’d like to join us in creating a literary community where we can celebrate and champion brilliant literary books. We hope that Dodo Ink can grow and expand in the years to come, and if we can achieve this, we’ll eternally be grateful for your support at the outset. Finally, in a pledge of his own, our MD Thom Cuell has promised that when we reach our target, he will have the Dodo Ink logo tattooed onto his arm. There might even be a vlog, if he doesn't pass out halfway through.  Risks and challenges All publishing ventures have an element of risk, and Dodo Ink is no different. Over 200,000 books are published in the UK each year, and all are competing for space on bookshop shelves, in newspaper review sections, and ultimately in readers' homes. To give our novels the best chance of succeeding, we will work with experts in PR, sales and distribution, as well as connecting with booksellers, bloggers and the reading public through every means available to us. This means making sure that our writers appear at festivals and in bookstores, and that we ourselves are active in building up relationships with booksellers and readers, in person, at events and through our Dodo Ink app, which is currently being developed. \n\nWe believe that despite the challenges facing us, this is a great time to be an independent publisher. Quality authors are being passed over by the mainstream, giving us the chance to work with the next Deborah Levy or Eimear McBride. With your help, Dodo Ink can become part of a thriving independent publishing scene, and we look forward to sharing some tremendous novels with you.

Touching my toes without my joints sounding like a bag of legos!  No...wait...  ACTUAL STRETCH GOAL:  If the campaign reaches $3,000 ALL physical backers will also get a copy of the paperback \"INKTOBER 2017,\" which will reprint all 32 Inktober drawings in higher resolution than digital, plus other drawings and commentary!  Are you a PDF backer?  You get the PDF version!  Thanks again to everyone who shared and pledged to the campaign!  I would kiss you all...but that might violate the restraining order. --- HI!   My name is J.\nRobert Deans, basically known online as “That Penguin Guy.”  About two years ago, I ran a campaign to\nstart a new series of children’s books, CRASS FED KIDS, with the printing of\nMOO THOUSAND AND PUN.  MOO featured\nShakes The Cow on an adventure in Space, and thanks to my wonderful 83\nsupporters, Shakes came to life! \n\nSince then, I printed three more books using a preorder\nsystem to pay for printing. First was another Shakes adventure, TEMPLE OF MOO’D.  The other two books feature Stanley, The Bear\nFrom A.U.N.T., in the young reader spy adventures THE HONEY DON’T CASE and THE\nCASE OF THE PUSHY OCTOPUS.  When I wrote\nTHE CASE OF THE PUSHY OCTOPUS, I combined the characters from both series when\nShakes’ friend Percie showed up to help Stanley during a mission under the sea.  (You can’t read that without hearing\nSebastian, can you?  Neither can I.) \n\n\n\n\nMy books. \n \n\n \n\n\nMy newest books, scheduled for release this Summer, tell\none story, from two perspectives, for two different reader levels.  Shakes is a Formoola One racing driver in MOO\nFAST, MOO FURRYOUS , and in the latest Bear From A.U.N.T. book, Stanley and his\nfriends investigate Formoola One race fraud in THE CASE OF THE CHICANE MUTINY . \n\n\nThe new books! \n \n\n \n\n\n(Yeah…I still like my puns.) \n\n THE CAMPAIGN \n\nMy campaign for MOO THOUSAND AND PUN included several bells and whistles,\nlike prints and coloring books.  This\ntime, my campaign simply covers printing a modest number of both new\nbooks.  Included with the cost of\nprinting, taxes and fees, and shipping, are funds to advertise my catalog with\nlibraries and bookstores across the world. \nI will also print extra copies to send out packages to a few agents and\npublishers to begin the process of moooving Shakes and Stanley to a greater\nstage.  This will hopefully get me closer\nto being a full-time writer of puns.  And\nbooks.  Not just puns, I swear. \n\nPrinting the books will cost about $1500, with the\nremaining funds covering promotion, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.  Stretch Goals will be determined shortly, but\nextra funds raised will at the very least mean printing extra books (woohoo!). \n\n\n\n\nMOO FAST sample page (colors/effects are incomplete) \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\nREWARDS \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this time the rewards are simple:\nBooks.  MOO FAST and CHICANE MUTINY are\nin process now, each about 70% done, with a completion target of March 15th.  From there, corrections, final edits, and\nformatting take another two or three weeks, and then it’s two to three weeks\nfor the printer to accept and approve the files, and deliver bound proofs.  Once the proofs are reviewed (and any\ncorrections made), the final order for copies for backers is placed on or\naround May 15th, with delivery expected by the end of May.  Books will ship to backers shortly after\nreceipt from the printer, or you can pick up your pledges at a convention\nappearance, or if you are local, they can be hand-delivered.  Toys are handmade by my wife, and will more\nthan likely be completed well in advance of the books, so there should be no\nproblems shipping complete rewards packages on time. (NOTE:   You can read PDF samples of my four previous books at jrobertdeans.com ) \n\n(Please Note: \nShipping to any of the contiguous 48 United States IS INCLUDED in your\npledge.  If you live outside the U.S. or Europe, contact me to make arrangements for delivery.) \n\nSo…what ARE the rewards? \nWell… \n\n\nHere's what you get for your support! \n \n\n \n\n\n With a $5 pledge, you can pick any one of my books,\ndelivered in a DRM-Free PDF file. A $25 pledge lets you pick any one of my books.  You can pick MOO FAST, MOO FURRYOUS, or CASE\nOF THE CHICANE MUTINY, or any of my other books. For $35, you get a HANDMADE PLUSH toy of Shakes, or you\ncan pick any other plush toy available from my web store at\ndeansfamilyproductions.com. \n\n\nTOYS! \n \n\n \n\n\nGiving me $45 gets you TWO catalog titles (get one of\neach of my new books, or two Shakes books, or two Stanley adventures…you pick). For $60, you pick any THREE titles (get an entire set of\nShakes or Stanley books, or mix-and-match)! \n$80 gets you FOUR! FOUR titles (Ah-ah-ahhhhh)!  (You may see a trend...and not just in my jokes.)  Pledge $100 and get you (Wait for it…) FIVE\ncatalog titles!  For a pledge of $115,\nyou get ALL SIX of my books! That’s every Shakes and every Stanley adventure! (NOTE: If you want to add a plush toy to your order, say\nyou want a copy of MOO FAST and a Shakes toy, simply add $35 to your pledge!) FINISHING UP… Thank you for your time in going through this campaign,\nand watching the video!  I look forward\nto sharing my work with you, and helping you immerse yourself into the world of\nShakes, Stanley, Percie, and all their friends! \nIf you have any questions, contact me through this page, or email me at\nRobert [at] deansfamilyproductions.com. Cheers! ~J. Robert Deans\n\n Risks and challenges RISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\nI have been on a fairly even pace since the first Kickstarter, producing a book every six months, if not faster. I have a good relationship with my printer, and have four books’ worth of experience in dealing with them, so I know what peculiarities might snag the printing, and I have accounted for those possibilities in my time frame. Feel free to contact me with any questions, or concerns, but rest assured that it is far more likely rewards will ship earlier than the first two weeks of June, than later.

Meet Junkard Brewing Company For those of you who haven't met us, we are two brothers who love beer. We are part of the generation that is described as being \"weaned on craft beer.\"  As many of you know, There was a time not too long ago when a domestic lager was your only choice when selecting a beer. We never experienced that era.. We grew up with craft beer more readily available, and we want to bring that a step further in the F-M area.  Aaron and Dan are the brothers, co-brewmasters, and owners of Junkyard Brewing company. We each have different taste for beers, and a different overall brewing style. We hope our differences in brewing styles reflect upon the beers we produce. We want to hand-craft a very wide variety of bold beers to keep your taste buds guessing. Not just a few styles and seasonals like a normal craft brewery.  In our brewery our goal is to keep automation low, and creativity high.  \n\n\nDan and Aaron \n \n\n \n\n\nWe need your help We are asking for your help to get this brewery to the next level. As i write this, we are in a temporary stage in our business. We sell growlers from the brewery, and distribute a few kegs to bars every week, but we are not satisfied with that level of production and we hope you aren't either.  Many of you have seen our small brewery, and can understand just how limited we are in this stage. We're just not making enough beer with such a small operation.  Right now we are in the process of remodeling our taproom. we have enough funding to complete the taproom project, but we will need a bigger brewing system to meet the increasing demand. Our current brewing system is already much too small. With the added demand after we move it will be very tough to keep up. If all goes well, we are planning to upgrade from our current 1.5 barrel brewing system, to a 7 barrel brewing system, which is about 250 gallons. We've purchased some stainless dairy tanks that we plan to re-purpose into our 7bbl brew house, but we still need to buy fermenters. If we can fund one or two fermenters with this kickstarter it would give us a great start. Our Taproom We have a building picked out and leased. We began construction a couple weeks ago. It's located just a block away from our current location (still on 1st ave). This has been a long time coming! We've been looking at Moorhead real estate for about 4 months now. In that amount of time we think we have some really good ideas for the taproom. We think we chose one of the best spots in Moorhead for our brewery, and we hope you agree! \n\n\nFuture taproom location \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nsome of the work we've done so far \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe purchased a few dairy tanks that we will repurpose into the brewhouse, but we will still need funding for fermentors. We want to considerably upgrade our brewing capacity in order to have a better variety of beers on tap and to be able to brew enough beer to satisfy all of the \"junkyard dogs\" out there. To do so we will need some high quality 250 gallon stainless steel fermentors. Each fermentor will likely cost around $7,000. You can be sure your generous donations will be going towards a good cause... the very vessels that your beer will be fermented in.  The Pledge Rewards: \n\n\n9 oz snifter \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n16 oz logo tulip \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nwork shirt (will have big junkyard logo screenprint on back) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nlimited edition tee (back) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nlimited edition tee \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\ngrowler carrier (tote) \n \n\n \n\n\n (empty growlers not included) \n\n\n\n\nThe Kegerator that started it all \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n4'x4' Sign (this is the one hanging at Rhombus) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nwindow sticker \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges We have been up and running for a year, and our biggest problem/challenge is not making enough beer. Once we get funding for our new fermentors there will be some lead time for the manufacturing, usually about 4 months. We hope to be brewing bigger batches as soon as possible.

    "textDescription": "Story *UPDATE!* Goal reached- but don't stop there! Thanks to everyone's generous contributions, production on MR HAPPY MAN will go into production! The $4,000 goal covered my work permit and crew fees for getting the film shot, but does not include film festival submission fees, getting prints made for festivals, dvd production, etc. Any extra contributions will go towards making the film better and reaching a wider audience! THANK YOU \nWHAT'S THE PROJECT? \nA short documentary about one of the happiest people on earth and most beloved resident of Bermuda, Johnny Barnes. \nWHY JOHNNY? \nJohnny Barnes, an 85-year-old resident of Bermuda, has dedicated his life to bringing a smile to people's faces. Bermuda has some of the densest road traffic in the world, leading to some very frustrated commuters. 26 years ago, Johnny was walking to work when he got stuck at a busy intersection. As people drove past, he started to wave to them and say good morning. He enjoyed it so much, he came back the next day and waved to people, blew kisses, and shouted \"I love you!\" At first, some people thought he was crazy, but pretty soon everyone started to appreciate a little bit of love and happiness to brighten up their dreary commute. Every morning since then, rain or shine, Johnny wakes up at 3am and heads to that intersection, spending hours waving and greeting all those who pass, sometimes stopping to pray with tourists for a safe journey home. Johnny has become the most beloved man in Bermuda, with many people referring to him as \"Mr. Happy Man,\" and there has been a statue of him erected at his famous intersection. Johnny has a lot to share about what it takes to be optimistic and happy in life, and I believe everyone who can't see him in person will benefit from a film about his life. \nWHY ME? \nMy previous documentaries, the award-winning PICKIN' & TRIMMIN' and WATERMELON MAN , focused on older gentlemen who have found happiness by doing what they love, which as a result has brought joy to everyone around them. The films have proven to be uplifting crowd-pleasers, and MR. HAPPY MAN will continue in this tradition. In the current recession, I think it's important to expose people to sources of inspiration for how to live a happy and fulfilled life. \nWHERE IS THE MONEY GOING? \nNormally, with this type of film, it is possible to call in favors and get it made relatively inexpensively. Unfortunately, the red tape involved with filming in Bermuda makes this impossible! Bermuda is beautiful, has no taxes, and the highest GDP per capita in the world. This means a lot of people want to work there (and it is overpopulated as a result), but they want to make sure locals get the best of their economy. It also means that for any non-native, working there is a huge hassle. It will cost a thousand dollars just for me to get a work permit processed! After that, as part of Bermuda law, I *have* to hire on-island crew to shoot the film with me, as well as pay rates that reflect the high cost of living in Bermuda. Fortunately, I've found a great production company with top notch equipment and experienced crew. My travel and stay in Bermuda has already been generously donated. The plan is to shoot for two days (The same length of time I shot PICKIN' & TRIMMIN' ) with good crew and HD equipment. The result should be great! \nWHERE IS THE MONEY *NOT* GOING? \nInto my pocket. All funds will go directly towards the production of the film. Johnny Barnes cheers people up at his intersection without being paid, so I will produce, direct, and edit the film without being paid! If the goal is reached- don't stop there! Any additional funds will be used for submission fees for film festivals, creation of tapes, dvds, etc. This, like many projects on Kickstarter, and Johnny's greetings, is a labor of love. I hope you will help me bring Johnny's story to a wider audience! \nUSING KICKSTARTER \nKickstarter is a great website that is easy to use. I've used it personally to fund projects I found interesting. All you need is an Amazon.com account. Create a Kickstarter account, decide how much you want to give, and make a donation! It's fast, easy, and secure. \nThanks, \nMatt Morris \nPhoto © Sharondipity Photography Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story The Magazine Hello. My name is Jen Doyle and I am a senior graphic design major at the Maryland Institute College of Art . For my senior thesis, I am creating a publication called Brazen Magazine. This magazine is a collaborative production that celebrates and embraces the aesthetic, intellectual, and political impact of women on today's culture. This magazine focuses on the achievements of women and how feminism impacts their lives. Brazen strives to engage women of all colors, ethnicities, nationalities, sexualities, religions and cultural backgrounds. It fights to create a platform for women to voice their thoughts, embrace their identity and to speak out. Brazen Magazine aims to expand the definition and goals of feminism in order to create a better and more positive understanding of feminism. I have constantly looked up to successful women in the arts for inspiration. I wanted to create a magazine that showcased the talents of women in order to empower them and my readers. Rather than impose my own opinions on what feminism is, I wanted to expose the different views and perspectives of feminism from women of all walks of life. Brazen magazine will cover topics dealing with feminism including gender, race, sex, politics, queer theory, intersectionality and more. This magazine will also educate readers on feminism and terms relating to this topic that can help inform both amateurs and experts on the topic.  Through this journey, I was able to expand my own knowledge of feminism and how I can become a better activist for women's rights. I was able to connect with friends and form new relationships along the way.  Budget This 100 page full color magazine will include interviews with artists and showcase their artwork. These artists include Rowan Fulton , Carly Carlock , May Kim , Laura Weiner , Kira Keck , Margaret Anne Hines , Hannah Brancato of FORCE , Christianna Clark  and many more.  The total amount budgeted to create this magazine and all the merchandise adds up to $3,000. 100 copies of this magazine will be printed through Blurb , which is a independent publishing platform. The rest of funds will be used to purchase a domain name and buy supplies to make all the rewards including stickers, patches, tote bags and posters etc.  Rewards For $1 or more, get access to project updates For $10 or more, you will receive the PDF/eBook version of the magazine and access to the project updates For $25 or more, you will receive a copy of the print magazine + all of the above (digital magazine and access to project updates) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $35 or more, you will receive a copy of the print magazine with a pack of stickers/patches + all of the above (digital magazine and access to project updates) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $50 or more, you will receive a copy of the print magazine with a tote bag + all of the above (stickers/patches, digital magazine and access to project updates) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $75 or more, you will receive a copy of the print magazine with a poster + all of the above (tote bag, stickers/patches, digital magazine, and access to project updates) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $100 or more, you will receive a copy of the print magazine with an artist print + all of the above (screen printed poster, tote bag, stickers/patches, digital magazine, and access to project updates) For $250 or more, you can meet with the founder of Brazen Magazine and have your name on the credits page of the magazine. 2 copies of the print magazine + all of the above (artist print, screen printed poster, tote bag, stickers/patches, digital magazine, and access to project updates) For $500, you are eligible to be interviewed by the magazine and have an article published in the magazine + all of the above included as well (2 copies of Brazen Magazine, artist print, tote bag, screen printed poster, stickers/patches, name in magazine, digital magazine, and access to project updates) \n\nTHANK YOU! Risks and challenges The risks and challenges involved with this project include both the quantity of content and the limited production time that I have. I am interviewing a lot of artists and also have a lot of content to design but I have a large team of friends, collaborators and teachers that are constantly helping and giving feedback to keep me on track with my schedule and dead lines. \n\nI promise to keep in contact with all my backers and keep them updated with the progress of my magazine through social media. Brazen Magazine will be a comprehensive magazine that highlights the impact of feminism through art but also educates readers on the importance of feminism and how it affect's today's culture.

    "textDescription": "Story The Novel is about exploration, imagination and growing up, for audiences 11+ yrs The Mission is to change the world, one young nerd at a time The Story: Kids in crowded cities played cops and robbers; I crept through golden wheat next to rusting tractors, a futuristic general in command of robot tanks. Suburban kids played hide-and-seek in cramped backyards; I went looking for lost empires in the jungles of tall corn, braving summer storms sent to end the world. Thus begins the tale of two siblings: Julian, a lonely daydreamer full of wonder and Lillian, his solitary and unusually intense older sister. On Christmas Eve, 1983, their adventure begins. Swept along by a curious explosion and a monstrous tree, they set off to find their missing parents. Along the way they'll team up with some familiar, and not-so-familiar, names and species in order to find their answers. They'll encounter wormholes, silver space suits, Venusian jungles, lost civilizations and labori . But they'll soon end up with more questions than they started with - about themselves, about each other, and about the delicate relationship between the heroes and villains inside all of us. **** Hi. My name's Lorum Ipsum. I'm a writer who's passionate about science fiction, especially the Golden Age stuff of adventure, of imagination, and examining timeworn problems in new ways.  And, rockets. Lots of rockets.  Problematica ( a term which, in real life, is used to describe things in the fossil record which cannot be easily classified as plant or animal) is my contribution to that rich vein. It's constructed of pieces that, if I've done my job well, people of all ages may grasp - kind of like describing complex formulas using letter blocks.  Told through the eyes of Julian Scobie, our eleven year old protagonist, Problematica looks at the moments big and small that make us what we all become - something both good and bad, something also difficult to classify. It's about growing up, making choices and remembering the possibilities of our amazing world. Short version: Each of us is two pounds of wet brain trying to deal with an entire universe. It's about that. It is the first book of two in the story. Solutrix, the follow up, will be out this time next year. The novel is two years in the making and 90% ready - it just needs a bit of polish and a little more editing. By supporting this Kickstarter, you can help enable the month's worth of days I need to do that. Fingers crossed, I'm hoping to strike a traditional publishing deal down the road. But for now, $2500 will enable me to put this out in late November and hopefully make someone else's world a little larger, and a little more wondrous, on that day.   Risks and challenges The biggest challenges I could see facing, after funding, are delivering the rewards in a timely manner. \n\nAll I can say is, this is a labor of passion. Nobody wants you to have this more than me. And my (hopefully!) future wife would never let that happen anyway. And there's a post office right down the street.

On the way to the co-op community site! \n \n\n \n\n“Nothing cannot exist forever.” - Stephen Hawking After the Big Bang, things moved quickly.  So did you.  Players in the game of Eons take on the roles of universal architects competing to shape the universe on a cosmic scale by gathering elemental building blocks to create stars, planets, and other cosmic phenomenon.  In a strategy game like no other, the architects engage the laws of the cosmos, using stars to forge more complex elements and form other heavenly bodies. Players must spend their own essence to marshal these elements, carefully gauging their resources and the benefits received from their planets and stars, as they guide the formation of their cosmos eon after eon; working to achieve the most victory points through a variety of strategies and hidden agendas to achieve their version of the universe.  Because eventually, the universe will end, and only one player will be victorious... “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.. .” - Carl SaganGame Summary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alpha prototype of EONS, this is not final artwork! Just gives a sense of the look for the game and how the board set up with three players. \n \n\n \n\nEons is a strategy game for 2-5 players, where each player takes on the role of a universal architect competing to create and form the universe on a cosmic scale.  Players will create stars, planets, and other cosmic bodies using elemental building blocks and their own “Essence”.  These cosmic bodies will generate more Essence for their architect and more complex elements to be used.  Cosmic bodies award their owners Victory Points, but each player is also working towards a unique secret agenda, which can add or subtract additional Victory Points at the end of the game.  The players must ensure the universe meets their version of events the closest, before entropy takes hold and the universe dissipates away. Each player begins the game with a small pool of resources and a hand of cards.  As the turn cycle progresses, players can use their Essence to purchase additional elements from the cosmic stockpile and build stars, planets, and other cosmic bodies from their hand.  Players will reap regenerated Essence and Victory Points from the cosmic bodies they control, and guide fusion within their stars to create more complex elements to add to their resource pool.  But players must be careful, and judge their fusion accordingly, as other players can force cosmic events that send their stars into supernova or destroy Essence and Victory Point rich planets.  Each destroyed star or planet counts down the entropy clock, and when a certain threshold is reached, the universe comes to an end and the game is over! Game Contents - A Game Board :  Used to track the Victory Point totals for each player, the Entropy Scale and provide eon cycle and fusion information for the players. - 5 Reference Cards :  a reference card for each player, providing the eon cycle and fusion cycles for easy review. - 147 Cosmos Cards :  The draw deck of Eons, consisting of cosmic bodies (such as stars and planets) and cosmic events (such as Life, Supernova, and Cosmic Collision). - 90 Resource Cubes :  cubes that represent the 5 periodic elements used in the game.  (25 Hydrogen, 25 Carbon, 18 Oxygen, 12 Iron, and 10 Uranium.) - A Sheet of Essence Tokens :  Tokens that represent the players’ Essence in both 1s and 5s - 5 Player Tokens :  Tokens for each player that are used to track Victory Points on the game board. - 5 Focus Tokens: Tokens for each player to use in setting their focus to allow a cosmic body to be immune from other player card based effects. - 2 Entropy/Phase Tokens :  Tokens used to track the Entropy Scale on the game board and to track which phase in the EON the game is in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you like to know more?

Rule Sheet Layout is final.  If we have an issue develop in play testing, we will address it.  These are the rules going to the printer on Monday!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% Week 1 Promise Well, I said I gave everyone homework, and although we did not get 50% in one day, we got there in 2!!!  So here you go.  This custom avatar can be used to proclaim your backer-ness in EONS!!  Wear it proudly on the forum and blog of your choosing!  Put it on facebook and twitter!!  Go forth Gamer Nation! \n\n\nDisplay Proudly, the EONS kickstarter backer avatar! \n \n\n \n\n\n\nWHEN DO I GET THE BAG? \n Many of you have asked if you receive the satin bag as levels higher than $45, and yes, you do.  We regret that the higher levels were not clear, but everyone from $45 up to the Architect will get a game bag, as shown below. \n\n\nThe Satin Game Bag, by Gamer Nation Studios \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTRA COPY of EONS - $30  Get additional copies of the game by simply adding $30 to any pledge amount.

Artisan Dice is the leader in the hand-made exotic wood dice and is entering the market of game tokens by producing a set of 5 Exotic Wooden EONS tokens.  The woods featured will be Bois d'Arc which is yellow; Purple Heart Oak; Lignum Vitae which turns green over time, Bloodwood and American Holly.  Pictured below are sample prototypes. \n\n\n\nEtched Exotic Wood Player Tokens \n \n\n \n\n\nLimited Edition EONS Set by Reaper Miniatures - $100 \nYes, it is an expensive Add-On, but let us tell you what you get.  First, your game will be upgraded to a Limited Edition, with over 160 all-pewter pieces.  Each piece has been sculpted, molded and manufactured by our fine friends at Reaper Miniatures.  All 90 Element Cubes will now be three dimensional pewter pieces, all the essence tokens will be small pewter coins.  The focus tokens and entropy counter will also be pewter tokens, and the best part is that each player token will be a brilliantly sculpted figurine, and if you know Reaper Miniatures, you know the quality that they produce.  If you are a painter, you can make the player figures shine with colorful brilliance and paint your focus token to match!  Take a look at some of the raw Alpha pieces we produced over the weekend.  These will be refined and perfected over the next 4 weeks until they are pristine!  You will still get all the components of the base game, with the pewter pieces added in addition to your base set. \n\n\n\nCthulu-esque Player Miniature - Prototype Sculpture \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha Prototype Pewter Pieces for the Limited Edition \n \n\n \n\n\nAlso included with the Limited Edition is an individually numbered certificate, signed by the designers of the game.  These certificates will never be included with the game again, making this a truly limited edition.  Now, for a laugh, see what Dave, who is not what anyone would call a painter, did when he got home last night.... \n\n\n\nIs that Orange? DAVE! Orange is not in the game! Well, I guess any color is in the game if you paint your own minis! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraq the project with Kicktraq! \n \n\n \n\n \n$21 ,000 - Red Dwarf Overfund Goal - NEBULAE FUSESPANSION \n \n\n\n\n\n\nNebulae Fusespansion is UNLOCKED! \n \n\n \n\nAt this level, we will introduce Nebulae into the game! Nebulae allow the player to build a non-cosmic body that generates Essence and Victory Points for them, even if everything else in their universe gets destroyed.  Due to the success of the game, each nebula card will be unique! \n\n$27,500 - Yellow Dwarf Overfund Goal - NEUTRON STAR FUSESPANSION! \n\n\nNeutron Stars have been unlocked!!! \n \n\n \n\nAt this level, we add the Neutron Star to the mix.  Neutron Stars and Pulsars, born from decaying stars, will add a new mechanic to the game that allows their owners to transform elements from their resource pool directly into essence during the FUSION phase.   \n\n\nThe Nebulae, Planetary variants and Neutron Star cards! \n \n\n \n\n$30,000 - Blue Dwarf Overfund Goal - Co-op Rules and Community Environment!\n At this level, we will make the full co-op rule s available as a pdf download to augment the game. If we hit $42,000, we can actually print the rules and place them inside the box. They are in alpha testing now, but we have a big vision for this, if you can help get us there.  We will establish a community for people to develop their own co-op scenarios and submit them to be published as regular content on our EONS site. This, in effect, makes co-op play limited only by the minds of our players. $35,000 - White Dwarf Overfund Goal - Blank Cards At this level, we will make the co-op rules available as a pdf download to augment the game.  At the next overfund level ($42K), we can actually print the rules and place them inside the box. $42,000 - Blue Giant Overfund Goal - BIGGER GAME BOARD and CO-OP RULES! At this level, we will be able to print a larger board and print a variant of the rules that will allow for cooperative play vs. the game.  The entropy counter will be on a constant march, and every supernova simply accelerates that counter as it races to 0.  Meet the objectives laid out for the team and win! \n$50,000 - Red Giant Overfund Goal - GALAXY EXPANSION!   At this level, we will be able to produce our fist expansion!  This is the Galaxy expansion and will introduce new mechanics such as Galaxies, Quasars and Moons, but will also introduce a new element - Silicon.  Professor Hawking theorized that silicon based life forms may exist in extreme environments, and so it shall be with EONS!  The expansion will be available in Feb. 2014 and we will communicate how backers are able to get the expansion when we hit the $50,000 mark. $67,000 - Yellow Giant Overfund Goal Well, now we are into crazy talk.  We have plans!  BIG PLANS!  Our game will expand with the universe to horizons not yet seen!  Chart the course, first star to the right....and straight on 'til morning! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was a fun resource management game that reminds us that everything was once stardust, and the endgame is an exciting descent into entropy as chaos spins out of control!  I had a blast playing it.\"     -Kat Boulware, ENnie Awards Judge - GENCON 2012  \" Dude, this was awesome, and you know...fusion...it's, like, the next big thing!\"     - Sam Witwer, Actor (Aidan - \" Being Human\"; Vader's Secret Apprentice - \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\") \"You've done a great job of making the mechanics make sense thematically. Having the fusion converting materials, entropy working against the order you create, etc. Just brilliant. I'm really looking forward to the game.\"     -Michael King, Salt Lake City, UT \"Unique strategy game that I could use in the classroom that is scientifically sound and fun to play.  Geektastic!\"       -Zach S., Astronomy Teacher, Plano, TX. \"If this game does not get nominated for an Origins Award or some other award, I am going to burn a hobo!\"    -A Gentleman Who Asked to Remain Anonymous, Denton, TX. \"The fact this might be educating on how stars are made and how you can participate is really exciting for me.\"  - Amy, DM Fiat Gaming Blog As Featured in DM Fiat, Gaming Blog on Feb 18, 2013. \"Players need to know when to get into markets and get out, and when to burn stars and not...you will be pleased with the level of scientific accuracy in the game. \" - StuThomas, Pretty Sneaky, Sis Blog \nAs Featured in Pretty Sneaky, Sis - Nerd Blog of Tomorrow on Feb 26, 2013.

Through founding and organizing large-scale events and collectives in London, we have developed the skills needed when working with many people and synthesizing many voices. \nA traditional saying here is Inshallah (God Willing) which means things can take a little longer to happen.

A Slide Show from Ashe Crowe! http://vimeo.com/30907156 A little about our venue: Since opening its doors on Election Day in 2008, Durham's The Pinhook has aspired to bring you national acts that rock and swoon you, from The Butchies to The Mountain Goats, and local acts like Mount Moriah and Dexter Romweber. Focusing on the expanding local scene, the venue in the heart of Downtown Durham has hosted legendary performances by both established acts and brand new performers. We're looking forward to bills such as *Shonen Knife / The Ghost of Rock*, *Javelin / Organos*, *Crystal Antlers / Old Bricks / FES*, *Memoryhouse / Nests / Jenny Besetzt*.    We also love to work with local organizations, such as Duke Performances, to host events such as benefits, community meetups, and informal sessions with visiting artists, musicians and filmmakers. Our mission statement sums it up, really :  The Pinhook is YOUR place. We believe that communities thrive when there is a public place for their citizens to be themselves, whether on stage or on a barstool, relaxing or rocking out.You have to make your own fun in life, and we’re here to help. What we plan to with your selfless contributions: * Work with the Triangles best sound engineers to design a room that fits the needs of our community, and the killer talent that's coming through our town.  John Koelle has engineered several venues in the Triangle, including Kings and The Haw River Ballroom. * Construct a solid stage with sound proofing that will be secure and handled with love in your downtown Durham venue for years to come.  * Work with designers to maximize space in the room for sweaty dance parties and packed shows.  * Purchase new equipment to push the jams the right way - a larger board to accommodate saving multiple sound checks, and hosting Guided By Voices  ;) * Essentially, we want to use the space we have in the best way possible to keep bringing you acts like O'Death and Shonen Knife, make D-Town Brass sound like the best brass band you've ever heard and Phil Cook and his Feat sound like he's playing in your living room.  We think you deserve it... Time-frame: How long have we been a local music venue? It's our three year anniversary and we're still going strong, figuring out how best to be your venue for hella fun. We want to have this set up by the end of the year so that we can kick off 2012 the right way ... Its time to pump up the bass, is it not?  Thanks for taking the time to look at our campaign!  If you would like to help out, please donate! * Many thanks to David Koslowski for the amazing video!

This is her story. My dream job was a nightmare! After working in Seoul, South Korea as a legal and marketing consultant for almost a year (December 2015 to November 2016), I quit my dream job. Although I was overworked and underpaid, I managed to survive everything (and everyone) except for my nightmare of a boss! Burned out, I rose from the ashes of my own fire and started freelance writing. I also starting living . Suddenly, I had more time for myself, my family and my friends again. I started to see and experience, discover and explore the world around me, and I finally wrote my first book (The House of Black Pearl) and started my second blog, Slay In Korea, with the help of my own mentors and muses in the Korean hip hop scene.  Slay In Korea is a blog, brand and business for international Korean hip hop fans, by an international Korean hip hop fan (me). Now, you can finally see and experience, discover and explore the Korean hip hop scene (and life in Korea \"as is\") for yourself. I'll bring the music, the artists and more---like the perfect outfit for a Korean hip hop party---right to your front door ... well, right to your computer or mobile screen. Girls and women who stay together, slay together! At 20-something years old, I'm finally pursuing my passion and turning it into my profession, but I need your help. You've motivated and inspired me to turn Slay In Korea into more than a blog, brand and business but a mission to help girls and women around the world stay together---and slay together! Through Slay In Korea, I'll break common stereotypes about \"life in Korea,\" letting you know what to expect, how to plan and what to prepare. Once you're here, you'll automatically be a part of something special: a group of girls and women from all around the world who want to do more than just live and work in Korea. Risks and challenges Starting a YouTube channel isn't easy, but I've got the personal and professional experience to make Slay In Korea a success.\n\nPersonal Experience\n\nMy first blog, Western Girl Eastern Boy, enjoyed millions of views each year based on WRITTEN CONTENT alone. I can't wait to reach even more visitors and get even more views on YouTube, where I'll talk about music, fashion and more with everyone's favorite Korean hip hop artists.\n\nProfessional Experience\n\nI have 2+ years of experience in marketing both at home in Austin, Texas and abroad in Seoul, South Korea. I've established a diverse network of different people, such as hip hop artists based in Seoul, South Korea and AR/VR companies based in Los Angeles, California.

Our Band's mission is to travel and meet people so that we can share the message of hope that we've all found in Jesus Christ. A message of God's love and sacrifice for us that has wiped away all the things about our lives that we think make us ineligible for that kind of amazing love. One large way we share that message is through the songs we've written and that is why recording this EP is so vital to the functionality of our band's ministry. The money that we're raising will go to cover the costs for recording, mixing/editing, mastering and then finally reproduction. Alongside the other expenses we have as a band such as traveling, gas, and purchasing a van, we're hoping you guys will be willing to help us with funding this portion of our ministry.  HOW IT WORKS: All you have to do is pledge to donate whatever amount you'd like, according to the prize category you're interested in and then wait along with us for the forty days to end.  At the end of the forty days if the donations have added up enough to meet our $2500 goal then the transactions will finalize and we'll contact you regarding your prizes! If at the end of the forty days we've come up short of our goal, the pledges will become void and no money will come out of your pockets. (But you also won't get any prizes... *wink*) We encourage you guys to repost links to this video to let your friends know about what we're doing! Also, we urge you all to take time and pray and think about if you'd be willing to donate and help us reach this goal.

    "textDescription": "Story The Challenge: A plant-based diet is kind to your body, to animals, and to the environment. But from time to time, it can leave you feeling dessert-deprived. Sure, fruit is nature's candy, but sometimes you just want to sink your teeth into something indulgent. Many vegan desserts either require hard-to-find ingredients or taste like a compromise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea: \n Kind Sugar to the rescue! We're making vegan cake mixes and frostings so you always have sweet comfort food at the ready. Kind Sugar desserts: \nAre made with just a few simple, quality ingredients \nTake about 5 minutes to make and 30 to bake \nAre vegan, all natural, dairy free, and kosher \n Whip up a batch of cakes and cupcakes to savor on your own, delight your loved ones, bring homemade desserts to work, or surprise your neighbors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Story: We're Tania and Ally - the founders of Kind Sugar. We were neighbors for years but only met when our dogs became friends. One day, Ally gave Tania leftover vegan cake she baked for a wedding. Tania fell in love with the cake and proceeded to eat it for dinner. That night, the idea for Kind Sugar was born.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Mission: One mouthwatering crumb at a time, we want to make it easier for people to make the kind choice. We aim to make sweet treats so delicious that even omnivores will ask for seconds. Once Kind Sugar is up and running, we will donate 10% of annual profits to sanctuaries that care for rescued factory farm animals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Game Plan: To make Kind Sugar a reality, we need to send our recipes to a mixing facility and print our packaging. \n$6,000: If we raise $6,000, we'll be able to produce our decadent chocolate cake mix and frosting. Use this mix to bake cakes, cupcakes, and brownies.  \n$10,000: If we raise $10,000 we'll also be able to make vanilla cake mix and frosting. With this mix, you can make traditional vanilla cake or use it as a base for marble cake, strawberry shortcake, carrot cake, rum cake, banana loaf, peach crunch and more. If you think the world needs more kindness or just more really (really) good dessert, please help us make this sweet dream a reality! Risks and challenges It is possible that we may experience shipping delays that are outside of our control, but we will do everything in our power to get your dessert to you on time.

Now... so thrilled to get to strive for my third stretch goal of $9,000, which will allow me to include the lyrics in the printed album!! There's only a few hours left, but I think it's possible. I'd love your help to achieve this new goal!!! Thanks, everyone! XOXO Wren A woman sits in an oak grove in\nSpain... Her lap covered with bits of fabric: her mother’s apron, her brother’s\npants. Memories. She stitches, and as her needle bobs, a quilt takes shape with all the\nliving beings of the world, all the streams and meadows, living harmoniously: a\nvibrant future she knows is possible. This is the story behind the title\ntrack, “Hand-Sewn Ocean,” of the album that I need your help to record. My last album, Bone Nest , recorded in 2012, was\nabout death and destruction, and the new life that can only be built from the\nbones of the last. I wrote that album after a challenging period\nin which I discovered I had a chronic illness, and struggled to find new\nmeaning for my life. Years have passed, and I find myself in a new\nplace. I have traveled back and forth between Galicia, Spain, and the Pacific\nNorthwest, learning always more about the lands and seas that shape us, move\nus, and inspire us. The places that birth music. From death, rebirth. And from rebirth,\nflourishing. This next album - with a special focus on Galicia - is full of exciting stories of hope, love,\nhealing, and transformation that I can’t wait to share with you.  Please join this adventure and pledge\nyour support!  My first album was funded 100 % out of pocket - and now, it's actually starting to turn a profit! But I need your help for this album because it is so much bigger than the last (5x to be precise): I am bringing in a full folk ensemble to stretch and expand my songs to new epic heights, recording and mastering the music to industry standards, and will be building a publicity team to help my music reach more ears. I'm pledging $2,000 of my own money towards the project, but need your help to cover the rest (paying musicians, artists, engineers, and publicists). Your donations will make this album possible! I need your help not only to raise funds, but also to\nspread the word. Please donate if you can and share this\nKickstarter on social media and with friends. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Wren \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Haven't heard my music before? Here are two tracks from my first album, Bone Nest , released in July 2013) \"Seal Barnacle,\"  Bone Nest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Giant Shoes,\"  Bone Nest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people know me as Laura Brady, but I started going by Wren back in 2010. It was a magical year - I had just finished my degree in International Studies, and for the first time since childhood was 'free' of planned next-steps. I leapt forward into life with a newfound zest, rekindling my connection with music, taking a permaculture design course, road-tripping to Colorado to study primitive skills, and for the first time, performing my new songs publicly.  At the end of that long, playful summer, I returned home to an email informing me that I had received a job in Galicia, Spain. I had two days to decide if I wanted it and, in a leap of faith, I said yes. In retrospect, it was a fork in my path, changing all that was to come. Like when I was 12 and dislocated my jaw and had to leave behind my beloved instruments (clarinet and oboe) - only to have this injury lead me to my next calling, songwriting on the guitar, seven years later. Or when I found out I had an auto-immune illness when I was 17, and my world fell apart, only to have the healing process become the gift that helped me rebuild a more genuine, nourishing, heart-centered life. In the same way, moving to Galicia broke my own heart - for the things I left behind in Seattle - but when I was ready to love again, it showed me a love more powerful and profound than I had ever experienced. A love of the land, and wild creatures, and the things that we grow slowly, bit by bit. During my year in Galicia, my songwriting took off, and I developed a body of songs that became my first album, Bone Nest. For the last three years, I've been performing consistently around the PNW and Galicia (where I return annually), growing a base of lovely, devoted people who support my music. In the last year, my momentum has accelerated to the point where I am spending the majority of my time on music and wilderness pursuits.  Stitch these things together? And you get my second album, Stitch an Ocean . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an album strongly rooted in the natural world - specifically, the ocean - and with a special connection to Galicia, Spain. The songs, which are already written, range from tales of love and transformation to healing and connection to the wild. In Galicia, I started\nstitching together a new vision for my life, and a dream for what our world\ncould be like. I came to understand that art and creativity were my strongest tools for connecting with the at-times overwhelming challenges of our modern world. This collection of songs represents my process of stepping into the identity of artist as culture-shaper, changer, and dreamer. (The title song is a story about this). \"Hand-Sewn Ocean\" (demo) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe album is deeply linked to Galicia, with songs evoking its seas and forests, many of which I\nwrote while living there, or on two return mini-tours. Galicia is a land of many folk stories about elves and magical woodland creatures, so my hope is for the album to evoke that whimsical mythology.  \n\n\n\n\nThis is an album made from and for the sea, from the NW of Spain to the Pacific Northwest. (Credit: Echo Photo) \n \n\n \n\n\nI’m also including my take on two traditional Galician folk songs, and am intending to release the album in a bilingual format, so the album design will be partially translated into Gallego, the local language.  This will be a full folk album! It will feature my Seattle band, Ariana Taylor-Stanley on piano, Anna Boyd on fiddle, as well as several guest musicians: Phil Hirschi on cello, Devin Mooers on mandolin and flute, and stay tuned for the announcement of the drummer and bassist! \n\n\nWith my Seattle band, Ariana Taylor Stanley (L) and Anna Boyd (R) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, producing an album is expensive! Here's the minimum I need:Recording and Mixing: $3,000Mastering: $500Duplication: $1,500Musicians & Artists: $1,000KICKSTARTER GOAL: $6,000 Other costs:Publicity (one month): $1,000Rewards and Kickstarter fees: $1,000MY PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION: $2,000 I'm asking for your help to raise $6,000 . I will be donating the remaining money from my savings and from the profit from my first album, Bone Nest. This is the minimum I need to do the project. However, it would help tremendously to meet my Stretch Goals: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$7,000  - and I can double my publicity efforts for the album $8,000  - and I can produce a music video for one of the songs! $9,000  - and I can include all the song lyrics in the printed album \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Album Art I am collaborating with Whidbey Island artist Lucy Brennan on the album design. Lucy is an illustrator and fabric artist, so she's the perfect consultant for this project given the 'Stitch an Ocean' theme. Though the art for the postcards, t-shirts, and bags won't be unveiled until the Kickstarter is over, check out some of Lucy's art here to get inspired.  The Galicia Photos: Five of my photos of Galicia appear in the set of stationary ($50-level and above), and/or choose two to be matted as part of the **Galicia Package** ($150-level and above). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Merchandise These are the T-Shirts from my last album (the new design won't be revealed until the album is finished). Expect a similar array of recycled textiles with fantastic colors and a hand-screen-printed design. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bag option is an organic canvas shopping bag/tote with the screen-printed design. Here is a sample from my last album. The new design will be bigger, with longer handles and an exciting new design! \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Making an album is an incredibly complicated process, and involves juggling dozens of people, schedules, and time-lines. Though I have done my best to predict the project schedule and completion date, changes in studio and musician availability, delays in producing artwork, or health problems could all result in some delay to the project. I'm guessing that the project will be completed by September, but I have set the anticipated reward delivery for November, to hopefully provide a good buffer for any production surprises.\n\nPotential delays aside, I feel prepared to delve into this project, and hope to deliver it on time! I'm glad to have one album under my belt - I have some idea of the challenges that might arise! - and am sure that no matter what gets thrown my way, I will persevere, and deliver a product that I'm proud of. Creating this album is a huge dream for me, and I want nothing more than to bring it to life! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Zodiac Cinema, creators of \"Docile\", \"Indestructible\", \"Iris\" and \"First Date Jitters\" along with David Skaggs, the creator of \"Capgras Syndrome\", \"Enigma\", and \"Standard Parking\" represent the 48 Hour Film Project Dream Team.  We return to the 48 Hour Film Project in full force this August with one goal in mind:  To make an amazing film and return to Filmapalooza in order to compete on the international circuit. And we need your help to get us there! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Little History about Us In 2011, a small group of us joined together to make a film for the 48HFP.  After a weekend of stress and excitement; writing and shooting; rendering and illegal driving; we turned in our film, \"Docile\" ,  and won the Jury Prize that year taking us to Filmapalooza and compete on the international level with other \"Best in City\" filmmakers all over the world. \n\n\nDocile \n \n\n \n\nThe second year of the contest, the members of this team produced three more 48HFP films.   \n\n\nIndestructible \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nEnigma \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nPoster of Capgras Syndrome \n \n\n \n\nWe have been honored to receive awards in the past for our skill in Directing, Acting, Cinematography, Best Use of Character, Choreography, Special Effects, Audience Choice as well as Best Film. With the experience and past success these films have brought us, we believe to be a top contender for the Jury Prize again this year. \nWhat is the 48 Hour Film Project? \n The 48 Hour Film Project competition challenges teams to make a film from start to finish in no more than 48 hours! Each team will randomly receive a simple outline of materials: Genre - something like sci-fi, horror, western or musical Prop - like an alarm clock, umbrella, or possibly a banana Character - a named character with their own description plus a Line of Dialogue The competition starts on a Friday night, August 23rd, and we have until Sunday evening, August 25th, to complete the film.  There is no pre-production work allowed! That means we have to completely write, film, edit and deliver the entire production in 48 Hours!  No Exceptions. Next? On September 8th, our masterpiece will show on the big screen of Screenland Crown Center in Kansas City, MO. along with the other entries.  Films will be awarded in the categories of Best Directing, Best Writing, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Acting, Best Use of Character, Best Use of Prop, Best Use of Line, Best Musical Score, Best Sound Design, Best Special Effects, Audience Choice... and of course The Jury Prize, Best Film, and a ticket to Filmapalooza. What is Filmapalooza The “Best of the City” film goes on to the Filmapalooza festival were it will compete against 120+ other Best In City winners from around the world . A selection of the “Best of the Best” films are invited to screen at the Cannes Film Festival . Where does the money go? We only have about a week to raise the money, we will be using the funds for: Equipment Rental Props Wardrobe Food for our cast and crew for the entire weekend Don't forget about caffeine!  There will be a incredible amount consumed in order to finish this project. Note: the money does not go to paying any cast or crew.  By 48 Hour Film Project Guidelines, no one can be paid for their work on such projects.   How can I help? You can take part in the adventure with us by donating and picking one of these awesome perks to the side.   Get yourself a DVD of all of our 48HFP exploits!  Follow us through our updates of the production ALL WEEKEND LONG!  Be our Guests of Honor for the Premiere of Kansas City's 48HFP films!  Or even be apart of the writing process and name a character!  All perks include your name in the credits and a magical IMDB page of your very own! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy the ride with us! How Does Kickstarter Work? Just in case you’re not familiar with crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, crowdfunding is when you pool contributions from various people to support a project in exchange for various rewards. Kickstarter is the most widely used crowdfunding website—on Kickstarter, if the funding goal isn’t reached within a certain timeframe, no one is charged a cent, and no rewards are distributed.   Which means we must raise at least $500 or we get NOTHING! Can I donate even after you've met your funding goal? YES!  Any and all money will go into the film.  As problems arise during the weekend.. the first thing to go is available cash.  If we are able to get even more money, that allows us to rent even better gear to make an incredible film that you had a part of creating. Can I see the film? An online screening can not be promised, but through the donating perks, you can receive a DVD of the film or even tickets to the Premiere here in Kansas City! \nWe want to thank you in advance for all of your support in funding our passions and making this great collaborative opportunity come to life! \n Risks and challenges Making a film is an obstacle in itself with the balancing of story, writing, lighting, acting, editing and music. Because anything that could go wrong.. will. Throw that into a 48 Hour timeframe? The results are nothing short of heroic!\n\nWith our veteran team of filmmakers with dozens of films under their belt, not to mention EIGHT films produced under crazy deadlines such as this. \nWe look forward to the challenge and shall arise victorious!

    "textDescription": "Story We here at Playing with Power! have always enjoyed giving our music away for free. Our goal is to continue to have our brand of retro-video game music free to download, however, we are asking for your help this time in getting the music recorded. We have a lot of new material that we are wanting to get a nice studio recording of, much of it you haven't even heard us play live yet. This will be our most ambitious recording to date, and we're excited to have you partner with us in getting it off the ground. Here's what your money will be going to: We will be recording at the \nstudio of Steve Holsinger here in Grand Rapids, MI. We've worked with \nhim in the past, and with Steve we can cut straight to the chase without\n wasting any paid-for studio time trying to \"find our sound.\" Steve has \nrecorded many local artists, including the awesome indie band Valentiger, whose\n latest album won the local award for best pop/rock album. Steve \nis a professional of the highest caliber, providing a relaxing studio environment, allowing us to make \nthe best recording we can. If, by some chance, this Kickstarter campaign winds up being far more successful than we planned, the extra money taken in will go towards making a better, longer album. If we still have funds leftover, we will then look into making a limited edition, physical copy that people who contributed $15 or more will be entitled to. We already have an idea for some really cool packaging that will make it a true souvenir to hang on to. We'll keep you updated in the unlikely event that this happens. Risks and challenges The main challenge will be having the album completed by our goal of October. The late summer and early fall will be a busy time for some members of the band. But we are committed to doing this right, and getting it done on time. \n\nWhy should you trust us to get this done on time and have it still sound of our highest quality? We are all professional musicians and have been in the studio many times. We are also putting a ton of time into individual practice as well as band rehearsal time to ensure that once we are in the studio, we can get the tunes cranked out without having to re-record a dozen times to finally get it right. We promise our best work, and an enjoyable listen for you! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

It has already seduced nearly a thousand guitar players with its convenient chords and scales diagrams. This crowdfunding will help me print the new version I've been working on, adding enriched chords and new scales. It will also help me promote it and distribute it worldwide. Le GuitarCookBook est une antisèche de l'harmonie à la guitare née il y a deux ans d'une première levée de fonds réussie. Il a déjà séduit presque un millier de guitaristes, pour la plupart Français.

Teachers will use it as a teaching document to illustrate concepts (harmonization, modes ...) to students who do not read sheet music yet. Composers and songwriters will use the harmonization of all scales in all keys with all types of chords to create fresh chords progressions. Advanced guitarists will be able to add new sonorities to their playing through uncommon scales associated with enriched chords of all kinds, or create acrobatic modulations, or creative harmonic progressions.

This hilarious live stage show takes all the elements of the cult classic horror films, Evil Dead , Evil Dead 2 , and Army of Darkness and combines them into one of the most insanely entertaining theatrical experiences ever created. Why do we need your support? Look, this show requires a lot of blood. And gore. And severed limbs. And shotgun wounds. And a talking moose head. This is one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken by No Name Players, and we need your help to pull it off. No Name Players plans to create the terrifying world of Evil Dead with the help of Steve Tolin, an award winning special effects artist. Your tax-deductible contribution to this project will be used to fund Tolin's Hollywood-caliber splatters, possessions, and dismemberment. Tolin is the owner of Tolin FX, and some of his most notable credits include work on The Dark Knight Rises , Jack Reacher , Warrior , and Adventureland . Tolin recently produced a feature film It Came from Yesterday , for which he and his team created the creature effects and production design.

It’s when many people (backers) give small amounts of $$$\nthat add up.  Kickstarter is a\nwebsite that facilitates these donations through Amazon.com . \n\nWe set a goal and a time limit to reach it.  You pick a reward level (see sidebar)\nand pledge an amount.  If we hit our target (or exceed it! ) then your credit card will be charged.  We'll collect the funds via Amazon payments and you get your gift.  If we fall short of our goal you won't be charged. \nIt's all or nothing. \n\nWhat is this movie about? The Housesitter, Part 1 of the of the The Demons Cross Saga, is the story of a struggle between two covert and ruthless powers. \"The Trust\", an elite secret society emanating from within a prestigious New England university and El Jefe, the shadowy figure behind Mexico's most powerful drug cartel.  While the power behind The Trust may be older and reach further, El Jefe has one important element on his side.  His enemies know less about him than he does about them.  The central character Susan, is from a family steeped in the traditions of The Trust, a tradition which she rejects.  However, in spite of her scorn she and her friends are not safe from the crossfire of this clandestine warand find themselves being stalked and terrorized by a monstrous killer. Where's the money going? The film is shot.  We wrapped on production September 10th and we are in post production now.  Right now the film is being edited, after that comes music, sound effects and a few finishing touches then were ready to show. Who are you? My name \nis Thomas Ascenzi.  I live in Greenwich, CT but I was born and raised in \nOswego, NY.  I'm a published poet, a screenwriter and filmmaker.  My \nfirst job in the film industry was craft service.  I got as far as \nassociate producer before I started focusing on my own projects.  The \nHousesitter is my first feature film. Okay, you didn't do it all alone? Of course not!  This is a collaboration of many talented people.   I spent months running lines and tweeking the script with the cast.  Nearly all of them were first-time actors yet they all behaved like professionals.  Whenever I needed more, they gave it and happily as well.  Of course the project really began to take off when Pablo Bonelli came on as Producer.  He and Juan Pabon, the Director of Photography collaborated with me on every framed and action.  Helio Abdal is credited as the Gaffer but in truth he had to turn 3 separate departments into a one man job.  A job he did astonishingly well.  John Smith, the art director, turned our pennies into real sets with vision and creativity.  We were all very fortunate to have come together on The Housesitter and it will lead to many more projects in the future.  However, there is no one person that was more important to this production than my father Robert Ascenzi.  He funded the production which, in and of itself is an amazing gift.  More than that he had faith in me.  He believed in this project, this trilogy, its vision and that we could make it a reality.  Now we just need to give it the finishing touch it deserves. Okay, I am in, so now what? First off...THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!

    "textDescription": "Story 'HOMEWARD' is the debut music video by San Francisco-based singer/songwriter/cosmonaut/urban-drifter, MARK NELSEN. It is also the title-track to an upcoming 5-song concept EP, co-produced by Greg Ashley and coming out on Breakup Records. Some of you may know Nelsen as a quaint wanderer. Or maybe as a human jukebox. Or maybe as the frontman of the band ELECTRIC SHEPHERD. This is Nelsen's first solo Kickstarter effort. In 2011, Electric Shepherd successfully raised money on Kickstarter to fund their limited-edition, collectable 'Chemtrails' 12\" vinyl single. The 'Homeward' video will be directed by SF-based filmmaker ANDREW HERWITZ and presented by Onema Pictures.  Herwitz directed Electric Shepherd's 'The Escapist' video last year. Electric Shepherd - The Escapist [official music video] from Andrew Baron Herwitz on Vimeo . Andrew says: For “Homeward”, we’re building a music video which captures transcendence. The vision is to embody a man’s consciousness as he slips between states of mind, as he moves to a higher ground. We’re deconstructing the moving image. Through old-school film techniques and scrupulously curated, wacko stock-footage, we’re taking apart a moment and rebuilding it, assembling a psychedelic frankenstein monster of images, shards of culture, flashes of color, emotion, light, love, death. It’s about moving on, moving up into the light, going Homeward, goodbye and so long. Mark says: Recording the EP began in Fall 2012, and its almost done. I'd arrive at the Creamery recording studio in Oakland with good friends (Sonny Pearce, George Rosenthal, Justin Boyle, Devin Farney) and a new song at each session. Its been a great joy to work with Greg Ashley (of The Gris Gris, The Mirrors) at his home studio. Greg's work has been a tremendous influence on my music ever since I was a late teenager. I view him as one of the Bay Area's most important songwriters and producers, and now i'm making a record at his house! Over the last year and a half of working on this EP (between Electric Shepherd touring and recording), 5 very personal songs were constructed. They tell of a hazy, bittersweet journey to find a new home - wherever and whatever that may be, through space and beyond. The EP's got traces of psych/shoegaze, dreampop, and good ol fashioned rock n roll. A completely experimental tune was even written and recorded in the studio. The title-track 'Homeward' is essentially what put this whole project in motion and inspired all the rest of the songs to be written, in track-list sequence. Tracking on analog tape: I was eager to see how well I'd do tracking on analog tape, as these are my first-ever tape recordings (one inch tape, 16-track mixing console). There is a tonal warmth and musical discipline found in records tracked and mixed on tape that is often lost in the digital process. The tone is vital to these songs. I've found that the Creamery studio is one of the most efficient, relaxed, and affordable analog tape studios in the Bay Area. I favor the sound quality of tape recordings; I have been recording on digital all these years, and I couldn't wait get my hands (and ears) on some tapeage. There hasn't been a better project to debut this with. Release show and video premiere: I plan to host a very special record release performance / video premiere of 'Homeward'. Attendees of the show will get to a experience an intimate, seated screening of the video, followed by a live set by me and my band performing the entire EP in sequence + other songs. Expect some tripped out visuals. This type of performance is a one-time deal. San Francisco Venue and Release Date TBA Music Video and Film Festivals: Andrew and I intend to submit the video to various film and music video festivals, namely SXSW and Noise Pop 2015. Onema Pictures, multimedia collaborations, and a huge THANK YOU: Please contribute what you can. Andrew and I want to make a video that we, the audience, can all be proud of. Although a 'solo' release, this project would not exist without heartfelt collaboration. Friends are one of my biggest inspirations, and collaboration is perhaps the most important element to long lasting art. It makes the humanity richer and the rock n roll heavier. If every musician, artist, and music/film fan we know donated just $10-$20 as they would toward a typical cover charge or CD purchase, this project could be successfully funded today. I want to inspire myself to raise the bar each time a new project surfaces - whether its with my own project or a friend's - and explore more conceptual, multimedia territory. It begins with a journey 'Homeward'. Thank you, love you, miss you, caught you, mind you. No, really. Thank you!

I have never heavily promoted my solo music in the 4 years i've been in Electric Shepherd, but i've played out and collaborated live a bunch. In 2012, I released a digital solo LP which received positive reviews and a feature article in the SF Chronicle. I have been performing and recording music around the Bay Area for about 8 years now, as well as having toured the U.S. with Electric Shepherd. I have gathered more fans, supporters, and contacts nationally and internationally since our last kickstarter campaign, and i'm confident they will help spread the word.

    "textDescription": "Story If you have missed out on our Kickstarter campaign, head over to www.eora3d.com  for pre-ordering and updates.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHi, we are eora 3D. Not long ago, we needed a 3D scanner that was both affordable AND highly-precise, but we were tired of waiting on others to build one, so we built one ourselves. We’ve made the world’s first high-precision 3D scanner that is entirely powered by a modern smartphone. It lets you capture everyday physical objects and surfaces and turns them into high-quality 3D models, all on your phone, making it extremely affordable.  This is the 3D scanner we wanted. It’s smart , powerful and beautiful and we know you'll love it, too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Seen In \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The eora 3D Scanner Can Capture The Very Soul Of An Object” - John Biggs, TechCrunch “The eora 3D Is The Missing Piece Of Your Star Trek Replicator” - John Brownlee, FastCompany “eora 3D has approached the problem from a different angle” - Klint Finley, Wired “hardware–and software–have all come together to make the world of digital design and 3D printing much more available to all” - Bridget Butler Millsaps, 3DPrint.com “Resembles a tiny R2D2-like robot who is holding up a smartphone, attempting to reach out and 3D scan the entire galaxy in front of it” - Tyler Koslow, 3DPrintingIndustry.com “Move one step closer to a Replicator with the eora 3D Scanner” - Uncrate\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Unlike Anything Before It \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we began work on the eora 3D scanner, our goal was to make sure it was extremely precise and easy to use. We considered every element that defined professional 3D scanners - the processors, cameras, build quality, turntable design, projected light scanners and laser based scanners.  Sure, there are all kinds of 3D scanners today -- from projected light scanners that connect via a tablet that are handheld and fast, to traditional flat-bed/turntable scanners that are too often slow and stationary -- but none are accurate, unless you have $15,000 to spend. \nSo we challenged ourselves to design and engineer a 3D scanner that not only was extremely precise and accurate but also fast, portable and affordable. The solution, it turned out, was sitting in our pockets. By harnessing the power and optics of a modern smartphone, we knew we could reduce our part-count and invest instead in the one part that makes high-precision scanning possible -- a green laser. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd by tapping into the potential of a modern smartphone, the result: 3D Models that are precise to sub-100 microns. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks with Android and iOS \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible with both Android and iOS, the eora 3D scanner connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0 and the eora 3D App is FREE to download from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe precision of the eora 3D scanner is an unprecedented sub-100 microns. Scans are captured in full-color and are rendered on-screen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScan up to a range of 1 meter (3 feet). Based on a typical smartphone camera's Field Of View this lets you capture an incredible 1 square meter (3 feet X 3 feet) in one scan. For objects that are larger, you can take multiple scans and stitch them in-app or on compatible desktop software. A 1/4\" - 20 UNC thread is included in the bottom for easy mounting on tripods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most unique feature of the eora 3D scanner is its green laser. Most consumer 3D scanners use a red laser, but digital camera CMOS sensors (like our eyes) are twice as sensitive to the green spectrum as they are to red. (It's how we evolved to better spot predators in the brush.) This means you can scan in a variety of lightning conditions, even outdoors.  A green laser costs almost three times as much as a standard red laser. But when you have a smartphone that does all the heavy lifting, it allows us to save cost on the camera and processor and instead invest more in other areas like the laser optics and powerful algorithms for the app. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth Turntable Unlike other 3D laser scanners, eora doesn’t require a turntable (because the app stitches together multiple scans from various angles to create a full model). Turntables can make scanning smaller objects easier, however, so we created an optional companion wireless turntable that connects to eora via Bluetooth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust Tap 'Scan' \n\nApp-driven means you already know how to use the eora 3D scanner. We designed the eora 3D app to be simple, uncomplicated and useful.\nJust tap “Scan.\"  The \"Library\" is where all of your 3D models live, and with Dropbox integration built-in, you can load your existing 3D models or share the ones you have scanned.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll New Ways To Interact With Your 3D Models  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can import your existing 3D models (.ply, .obj, and .stl) and with Dropbox integration you can sync your 3D models across all your devices. \n\nPublish And Share 3D Hubs was founded with the mission to create a global network of 3D Printers and make them locally accessible, and today an incredible one billion people are now within 10 miles of a local 3D Printing Hub. \"By bringing local 3D printing communities together, sharing knowledge and experiences, we aim to amplify an individual’s action to disrupt the larger systems that surround us. It's optimism in action and the belief in an individual's ability to enact change is what defines this Maker Movement. \" If you haven't been to a 3D Hubs community meetup , you should.  And thanks to 3D Hubs, everyone who backs the eora 3D Scanner will receive a $10 voucher that you can use towards your next 3D Hubs order.  \n\nAnd of course with the eora 3D app you can now share your 3D scans straight with the 3D Hubs community, and get instant quotes. If you run your own hub, you can now provide 3D scanning as a service, too! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Even More Ways To Share And Publish  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapeways  is the world's destination for 3D Printing as a Service. Thousands of artists, jewelry designers and makers upload their 3D models to Shapeways everyday. Since its inception in 2007, Shapeways has been defining the 3D Printing Industry. With the Shapeways API integration, you can now upload your models to your Shapeways account right away and get instant quotes.  \n\nAnd as you may have already guessed, many of the 3D Models on this page that we scanned are published through Sketchfab . Ever wondered how you could create your 3D Portfolio ? Sketchfab has the answer.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign & Manufacturing When you first hold the eora 3D Scanner, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The chassis is a single piece of extruded 6061 aluminium (high-quality plastic injection moulded bluetooth turntable), which is necessary to maintain the rigidity of the entire system. To be precise down to 100 microns, it critical that there are no vibrations in the system, especially when the top section that encapsulates the laser module is continually moving. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PCB's from our production test run, ready for component population.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototypes   We have built and tested 7 different major prototypes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline \n\nNovember - Verify results of ongoing PVT \n\nJanuary - Tooling for injection molded parts \n\nMarch - Ramp up production  \n\nApril - Ship BETA units \n\nJune - Ship units to kickstarter backers \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectively, we are experienced in Product Design, Engineering, Operations and Supply Chain.  An Open Line We are committed to making sure you are well-served as our backers.

    "textLength": 6959,
    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Maggie Price, and I’m here to tell you the truth. The truth about what happened in New York, the truth about the Super Alliance, the truth about all the weird things that have been happening.  Ok, Addy says I’m being over-dramatic.  But it’s true. The Super Alliance has worked hard to hide their bad side, but we want to show you the truth.\nWe were in New York when the battle took place, we saw the aftermath of that. We’ve travelled across the country and seen first-hand what these supervillains have done without any heroes to keep them in check.  There’s just one small snag…  Turns out, running from super villains doesn’t pay very well. And really, it should, considering the high risk nature of this work. \nSo that’s why we need your help. You can help us to spread the truth, get word out there, and build a resistance against the Super Alliance. Kickstarter is one of the few underground web pages we’ve managed to access, but in order to truly spread the word we need access to a greater platform, to the great darknet known only as “YouTube”. Your donations will not only feed us (right now we are surviving on Addy’s protein shakes and Connor’s Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, neither of which are really suitable for human consumption), but you’ll also help us get the equipment Connor needs to get our story up on YouTube and help more people learn the truth about the Super Alliance.  The superheroes might be defeated, but we can still make a difference by working together.  (A Note from Connor: Maggie likes to be dramatic and artsy with stuff, but in this case she’s actually right. And to thank you for helping us eat, I’ll send you some of those amazing and definitely fit for human consumption Cheetos. Sorry in advance if you get food poisoning.)  Meet the Gang \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggie Price:  Maggie is a 19-year-old college student living in New York, or she was until the Super Alliance destroyed half of New York. Instead of waiting around to see what would happen to the survivors left behind, Maggie decided to head to Los Angeles to try to find her sister. Maggie is an aspiring director with the sometimes annoying habit of narrating her life to a camera. She claims her favourite film is Amelie , but everyone knows it’s actually Disney's Beauty and the Beast.   Connor Fisher:  Connor is Maggie’s best friend, originally from Utah. The two of them met on their first day of class at college and bonded over their mutual love of Star Wars and hatred of people who confuse it with Star Trek. Connor is clearly the most valuable member of the group, helping them out time and time again with his impressive knowledge of superheroes and hidden talents. He also may or may not be the one writing these bios. That is irrelevant.   Addy St. Clair:  Addy is Maggie’s roommate at college. Their friendship was forever doomed when Addy realised Maggie was not as neat as she had claimed to be on the roommate form and Maggie found out Addy does not like Harry Potter. Addy loves yoga, fitness, and other things that are supposed to be good for you. Despite not getting on well, Addy decided to go with Connor and Maggie to try to reunite with her family in Colorado.   Ryan Jones:  Ryan is Maggie’s, um, old friend? He and Maggie met at summer camp when they were 8, and saw each other each summer for the next five years and there are clearly some unresolved issues there. For some reason, after the fall of New York Maggie thought Ryan would be able to help them. Some people seem to think he’s cute, though that’s definitely a minority opinion. And it’s fine, I can write that because I’m sure Ryan can’t actually read (if he could, I might get punched).  Ian Parker: How to describe Ian? He is an eccentric poet who ended up travelling with the rest of the group after… well, I don’t want to give too much away. But he sees the world differently from most people, which is sometimes a good thing, but mostly a bad thing. He is an artist at heart and has been spotted on several occasions talking to plants.\n So, what is this? Vlogging from the End of the World is a web series, coming January 2017 (provided we survive that long). It will follow our journey traveling from New York to Los Angeles trying to run from the Super Alliance while searching for Maggie's sister.  Along the way, we encounter various problems, ranging from normal things like running out of gas to a lot less normal things like psychotic evil villains. A surprisingly large amount of psychotic evil villains actually. Rewards So, we actually do have some rewards to give out for donating to our campaign (not just Connor's expired bags of Cheetos!).  For every donation you will receive our eternal thanks, along with some fun rewards. Have a look at the bar to the right to see what you get for each amount! Here are some examples of the super-awesome sticker options: The Freedom Squad \n\n\nIncredibrad - Crush - Saphire Star \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Super Alliance \n\n\nCreeping Vine - The Flame - Pied Piper - The Princess - The Professor \n \n\n \n\n\n+ more! Let's be real for a sec You might now be wondering what all of this is actually about. Vlogging from the End of the World is a new YouTube based web series created by two English sisters living in LA. They have been thinking about making this series for nearly five years now, and decided it was time to just go out there and make it. It will shoot in Los Angeles in September, and will be released from January to March 2017. The series has 24 episodes which range from 5-10 minutes in length, all filmed in a vlog style from Maggie's camera. Everything will be \"in character\", with the videos uploaded on Maggie's YouTube account. (In fact, this is the only announcement relating to the series that isn't in character!) The budget will go towards covering some of the costs of filming, such as: \nCostumes \nLocations \nFilm Permits \nFood for the cast and crew \nEquipment (lights, cameras... you know the drill) \nProp rental \n Our $10,000 goal is the minimum we need to get this series going. If by some miracle we manage to raise more than that, we will be able to get better locations and costumes, as well as improved effects and editing in post-production. Risks and challenges There are certainly a lot of challenges we might face, not least the fact that evil super villains are trying to thwart us at every turn.\nOther than that, there is, of course, the risk that no one will want to hear the truth (as people often don't), in which case our whole project would be useless. But we believe that at least some people out there don't trust the Super Alliance, and want to find out what's really going on.\n\nEither way, we aren't giving up (we'll even broadcast from The Flame's dungeon if we have to!)\n\nFollow us on twitter! @vfteotw\nLike us on facebook! www.facebook.com/vfteotw Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Problem #1: Phone Screens Break. Somehow, in 2016, the issue of cracked & scratched phone screens persists. With the average contract length now 24 months and screens costing £100+ to replace, we knew the market was crying out for a more progressive form of device protection (around 25% of iPhone users have cracked screens: http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/quarter-of-iphones-have-a-broken-screen-says-new-poll/ ). The dilemma for the consumer is obvious; they don't want to ruin the aesthetic of their device but they do want it protected. This issue led to the creation of the SecondSkin ONE - the World's #1 Performing Screen Protector (getSecondSkin.com ). \nProblem #2: People have wondering eyes! We've all experienced that feeling of frustration when someone is giving your phone the sideways glance. Mobile devices are such a huge part of our life now, whether for business or pleasure, and some things are for your eyes only. If only we could pull our phones out any time, any where and not be fearful of prying eyes...\n\nThe Solution:\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the SecondSkin ONE, the Ghost is made from chemically-strengthened glass \n \n\n \n\n\nThe Ghost builds on the revolutionary MultiLayer Technology™ used for the SecondSkin ONE by adding one more layer: The Privacy Layer. With this, the screen can be viewed as normal from a face-on, 90° angle but will appear totally black from just 30° either side (watch your friends' faces as they see you typing on a phone that appears to be turned off). Every other feature of the ONE comes as standard with the Ghost - only now not only is your screen protected, your personal information is too.\n\n \nHow does it work? \nThe technology is designed to simulate microscopic Venetian blinds so that your screen cannot be viewed from either side despite it appearing as normal from the perpendicular view. This added functionality adds a negligible increase in size from the original ONE model. \nPrototyping:   \nResearch into adding a Privacy Layer to the original ONE began in the 3rd quarter of 2015 with the initial challenge proving to be maintaining the ONE's low profile. After countless iterations of protectors that we deemed too thick or not offering enough privacy protection, we now have a product that fulfills our initial goal of providing unparalleled protection for your screen and personal data whilst retaining the performance and aesthetics of your device.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe finished product on the iPhone 6. Note the immediate darkening of the screen as you move away from the perpendicular, 90° angle. \n \n\n \n\n\nWhat happens next (fulfillment): \nIf we reach our £2500 goal, production will begin around 3 days after the campaign ends. We are confident ALL orders will be shipped within 2 weeks of our campaign ending. If we reach the goal with plenty of time to spare we may be able to begin production early - we'll continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated.\n\n \nAvailable Models:\n \nApple: iPhone 5, 5S, 5C, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus\n Samsung: Galaxy A5, A7, S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 4, Note 5 OnePlus: X, 2 HTC: One A9, One M9 Sony: Xperia Z5, Z5C, Z5P LG: G4, V10 Nexus: 6, 5X, 6P Asus: Zenfone 2 BlackBerry: Priv     (With more to be added in due course). \nNew: Windows Phone: Nokia: Lumia 735, Lumia 930 \nNew:  Wearables: Apple: Watch (38mm), (42mm) Samsung: Gear S2 Moto: 360 2 (42mm), (46mm) \nStretch goals: \nThanks to our existing infrastructure and the fact we're able to put a high percentage of the money up ourselves we are able to set a fairly low goal of £2500 - without this the number would easily be in the 10's of thousands. If we get to £5000 though we will also be releasing a select number of tablet and wearable models. \nGet in touch - We'd love to hear from you!

    "textDescription": "Story Film Synopsis: \nJamie is moving from Chicago to New York hoping to become a famous actress. Her best friend and roommate, Jessica, isn't happy about it, because she is losing more than a friend. Jessica is not-so-secretly in love with Jamie. Although Jamie doesn't feel the same way, she has gotten used to Jessica's attention. As moving day gets closer, Jessica tries to make Jamie jealous (and get her to stay in Chicago) by sleeping around with other girls. But Jessica's plan backfires, in a way she could never imagine.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProject Details: \n• WHAT MAKES THIS FILM DIFFERENT\nI’m making the kind of film I want to see more of-- a cross between a lesbian buddy movie & a romantic comedy. Think “Show Me Love” meets “My Best Friend’s Wedding”, add two cute queer college girls and stir. \n“Jamie and Jessie Are Not Together” is about two women whose codependent, loyal friendship is fraught with erotic tension. It’s not about \"coming out\", but about two people on the cusp of adulthood, figuring out how to grow together or how to grow apart. \n• WHY THIS FILM WILL BE SUCCESSFUL\nThis film has good bones--complex characters, a simple story line, gorgeous cinematography--and great legs. The goal is to create a wildly popular feature film that evokes the common experience of young love and lust, which just so happens to have queer protagonists. \nThere’s clearly a gigantic market for LGBT, lesbian/queer feature films. This audience is hungry for movies that reflect our lives in all their complexity. But “Jamie and Jessie Are Not Together” will have broader appeal because it deals with universal themes and takes its inspiration from independent films like “Garden State” and “Lost in Translation”. \nI believe this film will do very well in festivals worldwide and will very likely secure global DVD and digital release upon completion. \n• WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION\nMy previous feature, Hannah Free, is about the lifelong love affair between an independent spirit and the woman she calls home. It stars the awesome, Emmy-winning Sharon Gless of “Queer as Folk” and “Burn Notice”, and has received 5 audience awards for Best Narrative film. It is currently being distributed globally (Wolfe Video) and digitally (iTunes/Netflix/Comcast). Hell, it's even made it past the censors and is for sale at Target! \n• HOW WE DO IT ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET\nThe money from Kickstarter will be used for the Pre-Production and Production phases of the “Jamie and Jessie Are Not Together” project. This includes equipment, food, cast and crew stipends. In addition to Kickstarter funding, the cast and crew are working at reduced rates, and some of the equipment is being donated. \n• TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE\nWe will be shooting in mid-September in Chicago, with the goal of having a rough edit finished in time to enter major film festivals with winter deadlines. \n• WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU\nAs I see it, a contribution to this film represents an investment in the future of sophisticated queer cinema.\n• Also, to your right, please check out the lovely rewards for each of the fabulous contributors!\nxoxoxo\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------http://www.hannahfree.com http://www.wendyjocarlton.com Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

I believe strongly that repurposed materials not only create beautiful pieces with a unique history, but also are environmental friendly. This alone is worth the extra effort. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series is being offered in pine & ipe woods, and will be branded with the monkey logo as a signature of quality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese trays are created using a multi-purpose distressing process. Wood for these trays is selected based on the look of the grain, featuring the unique properties of each piece. These trays are constructed using wooden dowels, rather than screws or nails, for both quality and character. After being assembled, the candle trays are sanded to soften the joints, dowel points and edges. The aged look of each piece is further enhanced by first applying a full coat of paint, followed by a light sanding, which allows the remaining paint to expose certain unique attributes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo bring out the grain and characteristics in each piece, a stain is applied to the pine trays. After, a coat of UV-polyurethane is applied to seal in the finish. \nThe ipe tray, however, is neither stained nor clear-coated. Instead, a heavy layer of penofin oil is brushed on to bring out the natural darkness of this wood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest these trays as decorative centerpieces suitable for tables, mantles or windowsills. These trays are great for both indoor and outdoor spaces, as a beautiful way to display candles and prevent spilt wax. I am committed to keeping an environmentally conscious business model, and hopefully inspiring others as much as this process has inspired me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplease visit my site at fboke.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Even with an order twice as large as my goal, I've given myself enough time to fulfill orders with delivery before Christmas.

With the support of Kickstarters, we're hoping to launch our brand, launch our first-run of merchandise and apparel, and create our online retail store.  \nWe're here to make America's pastime look good.The Story  - Baseballism started in 2006 as a baseball camp and private lessons company in Eugene, OR, and although the camp was highly successful, the camp shirts turned out to be even more popular.  After each camp, participants and parents demanded more camp shirts to wear around casually. We realized that people wanted to share the love of Baseball, that it was bigger than just their individual teams. We wanted to create something fresh for the Baseball community that differs from mainstream athletic brands, representing the unique culture, and paying tribute to the sport's illustrious history. Baseballism is a brand for the Baseball community, created by members of the Baseball community. \nYour Support   - There are two major ways you can support Baseballism:1. Tell your friends, your team, your family, people you know, people you don't know, tell someone about Baseballism and our Kickstarter project.  One of the best ways to start is to like our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter. 2. Become a Backer - With the support of backers we will be able to produce merchandise that can be sold in stores and online.

We learned a lot of things since launching the first time and it has helped us make this project better for both us and you, our backers. We will continue to be as transparent as possible as we want to build trust with our backers. Everyone understands that there always risks involved with Kickstarter campaigns but we will do our best to minimize those risks.\n\nThe risks we face are mostly in the manufacturing and fulfillment process as all the art and rulebook are done in house by our team. The artwork is about 85% complete with just some final adjustments to be made. The rulebook is also close to being finished with just some fine tuning of wording and updating the artwork as it is completed.\n\nWe have our manufacturer lined up and have talked to fulfillment centres to make sure everything will run as smoothly as possible. All our files will be ready for manufacturing as soon as the Kickstarter is successful. This way we can get started on getting complete samples made and start the manufacturing process as soon as possible.\n\nWe've done our best to provide our backers with a reasonable Kickstarter discount for both the game itself and the shipping costs. We hope you'll join in helping us bring this project to life and enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed designing it. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nThe American: The Life, Times, and War of Basil Antonelli \n \n\n \n\nThe\nAmerican: The Life, Times, and War of Basil Antonelli , by Daniel Roberts is the true story of one man's, part biography, part saga, and all American. The American: Basil\nAntonelli and his family fled the poverty, privation, and tyranny of Mussolini’s\nItaly to find a new home in America. They settled in a unique all Italian\ntown in southern New Jersey where they persevered through the Great Depression forming a lasting bond with America.\nDuty bound by love for his adopted country Basil enlisted in the New Jersey\nNational Guard. He went on to receive a field commission in the 3rd\nInfantry Division and volunteered to join a broken outfit, the 805th\nTank Destroyer Battalion, and fight on the front lines in Tunisia and Italy.\nHis service eventually brought him home to Italy and only a stone’s throw away from town where he was born. There, the\nbattle of Monte Cassino raged between Mark Clark's Fifth Army and the\nnear impenetrable German Gustav Line. Within sight of his ancestral village\nBasil Antonelli paid the supreme sacrifice, his war was over, but his legacy lived on. From the author: The American is a two year labor of love that has suffered complications. Initially it was commissioned by my friend, coauthor, and employer, Robby Wilson of the Wilson History & Research Center (Militaryheadgear.com ). Robby intended the book to be the first in a series of published works chronicling unknown, but dynamic, historical stories. For the book he and I traveled through Italy with Basil Antonelli's descendants trying to get to the bottom of what it meant to be an American. Unfortunately, my friend Robby recently succumbed to a courageous two year battle with cancer. I have decided to use Kickstarter as a way to fund the books hardcover publication, preserve my friend's legacy, and bring an important and deserving story of heroism to light. Books are available for per-order here on Kickstarter. I invite you to purchase The American in advance of its printing, in both digital (PDF and EPUB) and hardcover formats. If I can sell 250 pre-order copies here I can definitely swing the purchase of 1,000 hardcover books, which is a 1,000 more people who will learn the story of Basil Antonelli. I have also included other opportunities for services, provided by me, Daniel Roberts, the author. These include opportunities for appearances, historical research, and if you are interested, commissioned works. rest assured that these appearances are not your typical dry historical lectures but rather tales of adventures researching the book and serving as an artifact purchaser and researcher for the Wilson History and Research Center.  I am very excited and hope you will join me in celebrating the life of Basil Antonelli, an American hero. \n\n\n1st Lieutenant Basil Antonelli \n \n\n \nBelow is an excerpt from \"The American: The Life, Times, and War of Basil Antonelli:\" \"Basil’s 16-day journey aboard the Hugh L. Scott was thankfully uneventful save for a storm off the coast of Iceland. The Navy used flag signals to maintain radio silence and kept a watchful eye for German submarines. Soldiers on board spent their time doing calisthenics, listening to lectures on French/Arab society, and firing the brand-new “rocket gun,” commonly referred to as a bazooka. On the night of November 6, 1942, the armada finally split into three groups as planned. Sub Taskforce Brushwood, the Hugh L Scott, and Lt. Basil Antonelli continued on to Fedhala Bay. For days Admiral Hewitt and General Patton fretted over weather reports that the surf would be too high, but when Brushwood arrived just before midnight on November 7th they were greeted with calm seas. The transports then arranged themselves in a two square-mile formation, six miles from the shore, with the Leonard Wood, Thomas Jefferson, Charles Carroll and Joseph T. Dickman at the vanguard.           In the dark, troops shuffled around on deck, getting their equipment in order. The Army believed every man should land with several days worth of supplies in the event they were stranded on the beach. Every soldier had a weapon, side arm, ammunition, tent, field stove, food, mess kit, emergency kit, sewing kit, toothbrush, toothpaste, shovel, life vest, watch, cigarettes, whistle, matches, French-English phrase book, and a prophylactic. The British attack on the French fleet at Mers El Kebir left unresolved resentment and American officials feared retribution might be taken on English-speaking American troops, so soldiers also wore an American flag armband to advertise their country of origin to any French forces they met. Thirty minutes after midnight on November 8, the first men started climbing down cargo nets into waiting landing craft. The sea was calm, but nervous troops, loaded to the neck with equipment, were slow going over the side. Having never been properly trained at climbing down the heavy rope nets, they waited until the men below them were securely in the boats. Their anxiety pushed the landing time back by another hour. Even with so much caution, accidents happened. One soldier fractured his foot when a sack of ammo boxes fell from the deck into his landing craft.\" Risks and challenges Completion of this Kickstarter project means that I am going to have the hardcover version of the book published through an independent printer. As a result it will take up to 5 weeks to get the books published and as much as another 2 weeks for them to reach me and be ready for shipping to purchasers. This means that while I project being able to send the books out in December 2012 it might not be until January 2013 before the hardcover books officially arrive. (Again I am hoping to have them ready for Christmas)\n\nThe hardcover books themselves will actually cost $20, but I have added the $5 to cover shipping.\n\nDigital book purchasers will be directed to a third party website via e-mail where they can download both EPUB and PDF format copies immediately after the projects completion. I am completely open to any other formatting changes that you would like to make independently to the file to work with one of the zillions of different e-readers. I only request that if you are sent a digital copy you will refrain from copying it and sending it to friends as this is a copyright violation, and stealing. \n\nAs for the other rewards. I will need to schedule any event visits well in advance, particularly if it requires me to fly somewhere. \n\nIn the case of the research project rewards it will be necessary for me to communicate with the purchaser via the internet and over the phone. My contact information will be provided to them immediately after the project is completed and I will be able to give a schedule of how long the report will take.

    "textDescription": "Story Our Kickstarter is over but you can still find Neoh on www.3dsoundlabs.com \n Neoh : the first smart 3D audio headphones Please meet\nNeoh, headphones for cinema sound anytime, anywhere ! Neoh is the first wearable home\ntheater system. These headphones provide spatial sound simulation, using\nembedded motion sensors to provide the most immersive sound experience\ntechnology has ever brought to you. Our mobile application simulates\nmulti-point sound sources in a virtual environment. The experience is\ncomparable to the latest generation of movie theater surround sound systems or\nthe most sophisticated home theater equipment on the market. With our 360° sound technology, we have successfully\nintroduced a realistic and theatrical sound experience to 3D audio headphones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\nwe call 3D sound is the real life’s sound. With Neoh headphones, we have\nability to reproduce a sound that will appear to come from anywhere we want it\nto come from. We create a full artificial environment (360°) with\nsound sources you will perceive as coming from any distance or direction. MONO One source, one speaker, one channel… This is a monophonic sound reproduction. It is the sound given to you by the gramophone in our video. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEREO Two sources, two speakers, two channels… Most of the time the stereophonic sound is represented by a left and a right speaker. It is what you have found in all the other headphones up-until today. Don’t be afraid, it’s over now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMULTISOURCE This is what you got when you bought a home-theater sound system. You had to install five speakers, two behind you, three in front and one subwoofer for the bass. You can find 5.1 sound on DVDs, Blu-rays use 7.1 sources (same principle, 2 more speakers). It means you would have to buy and install up to eight speakers, to enjoy it but in one room only... However this provides a pretty good surround sound ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, you don’t need this anymore. Neoh is your own personal home cinema and you can take it with you anytime, anywhere. Some new\n3D audio formats are coming up, with even more virtual sound sources and a\nlarge number of speakers to reproduce them. Get ready ! Neoh breaks the\nbarrier of having a limited amount of sound source.: You will be completely immersed in the sound. \n\n\n\n\nNeoh is your own personal home cinema and you can take it with you anytime, anywhere. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the free Neoh player, to \nwatch a movie on your iPad with 3D Sound. If you don’t have an iPad, maybe you could \nwatch a movie on your iPhone with 3D Sound. Soon you will be able to \nwatch a movie on your laptop too. You have to \ncall your friends to tell them you’ve got a Neoh. Obviously, you can \nlisten to music from any device you want but most importantly, \nenjoy it with your friends ! Very soon, you will \nwatch movies with Android devices, \nplay video games in the most immersive way or \nenter a virtual reality with a real 3D sound ! \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur mobile application uses advanced signal processing algorithms to\nposition the different audio sources. For\ninstance, with a movie providing 5.1 audio channels, if a sound is\ndefined to be coming from the source on your back right, you’ll hear it coming\ndirectly from your back right. You will be able to play any movie and any music without having to change their format as we have made it compatible with most of multimedia standards available out there. We have also made it easy for you to access all of your content : \nDirect download \nConnection to your Dropbox \nConnection to your Google Drive \nConnection to your personal server \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can accelerate the development of our application on Android \n \n\n \n\n\nOf course, you can also use Neoh without our mobile application: Neoh will work like any other pair of headphones.... Only without the realistic and immersive experience of 3D sound. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Motion sensors: The housing on the left\nof the headset encloses our electronics. It is composed of many components,\nincluding gyroscopes , an accelerometers and a magnetometers . The sensors’ data\nare sent to our application by a Bluetooth Low Energy chip. All the system is\npowered by a rechargeable battery. The sensors track every one of your\nmovements. Indeed, you do not stay completely motionless while watching a\nmovie, and we have to offset even the smallest of your micro-movements to\ncompletely immerse you in your activity. \n\nThis is due to a\npsychoacoustic effect. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your daily life, you subconsciously make a detailed analysis of your environment and you're brain gives specific attention to any kind of change within this environment. When you hear a sound, you unconsciously move your head in order to figure out the exact origin of the sound. The difference perceived in the sound is necessary for your brain to accurately locate sound sources. It does not need a large movement, just a few degrees is enough. You also make those micro-movements when you are watching a movie. This gets more important as the number of sound sources increase. Neoh compensates those movements  to create a fixed audio sources relative to the screen. Without this your brain won’t be able to figure out exactly where the sound is coming from: This is the only way to have a full immersion  and an experience comparable to that of reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing able to hear sound where they’re supposed to\ncome from is also very useful in a lot of video games . First Person Shooter\ngames are an obvious field of interest; Neoh gives you an incredible tactical\nadvantage . Improving the perception of your environment, it enables you to have\nquicker and better reactions to game events. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, compensating those micro-movements increases\nthe realism to an incredible extent to truly immerse you in a virtual reality. \n\n\nWith regular headphones, the sound sticks to you : not so realistic after all ! With Neoh and its motion sensors, the sound stays where it's supposed to be: you're immersed in a virtual environment ! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\ndo we mean with mobile cinema ? When\nwe think about mobile cinema, we think about you, watching a movie anywhere,\nanytime you want. You’re on a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or a\ntablet. We have chosen to start our development on iOS but we are already\nworking on deploying our technology to others platforms. Why\nare we doing this ? We are doing this to let everybody enjoy\nthe quality of movie theater sound. A home-cinema system can be expensive, requires a lot of space and is used\nin only one room. While on a tablet, you can enjoy a cinema sound experience in\neach room, while traveling or even at the office! What’s next ? We are already\nworking to extend our technology to personal computers. A successful campaign\ncould help us accelerate this ! We already integrated it in our video because this\nis planned for the near future, and your support, we will be able to make it happen\nfaster, as soon as this summer ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAMING Our technology will be a great enhancement to the\ngaming world! By now, every gamer can probably imagine the incredible potential\nof Neoh in gaming. Imagine being fully immersed in your favorite digital world.\nBattling it out in a war zone? Have an edge on your opponent by hearing them\nattacking from behind. Racing cars? Hear the roar of the engine from the driver's seat as you zoom by\nyour opponents.. Your support will accelerate the development of the\ncomputer platform for Neoh. With your help this could be as soon as this summer VIRTUAL REALITY We think that virtual reality will become increasingly\nimportant in the foreseeable future. In fact, we are not the only ones to think\nso ! This is why more and more companies develop VR technologies and devices.\nNew features are introduced everyday ! So far VR has been mostly about video. Audio is needed\nto bring a more realistic and immersive reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verge : \"You can buy these head-tracking headphones instead of 25 speakers\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGizmodo : \"In trying it out for a a few moments just now, it definitely works: The sound stays put spatially, even as your head moves.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Guide   : \"3D Sound Labs may have found the winning formula with its Neoh\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a team of professionals, entrepreneurs, scientists and engineers passionate by sound. \n\n\n\n\nThe 3D Sound Labs team ! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been a long journey already: from algorithms development, electronics and mechanical prototyping, assembly of the first samples, testing, then ... re-doing it over again until we reach a result that satisfies us ... to supply chain and logistics... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Neoh is almost ready to hit the shelves. Molds are built and the headphones are industrialized. We even designed a nice packaging to give you a great Neoh experience, right out-of-the-box. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we are not yet at the end of the road: CERTIFICATIONS We are going to get our products certified (Wireless certifications, FCC, …). We have done\neverything from start to facilitate this. From electronics to plastic\ncomponents, everything has been pre-checked and validated. APPLICATION We are finalizing our mobile application. We have optimized all our algorithms and developed\nan alpha-version. From now on we need to develop a great user-interface to make\nyour experience with Neoh as intuitive and straightforward as it deserves to\nbe.

    "textDescription": "Story Unlimited Edition—1 of 6,227,020,800   The idea of this project is to create a unique art piece for every person on earth. For this purpose I designed a mold comprised of 14 different pieces that can be arranged in a different sequence before each cast. The total number of unique permutations is 6,227,020,800 which roughly correlates to the current world population (see how I do the math below).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work? The mold is designed on the computer and then a negative is produced by a computer-controlled milling machine. Into this negative I cast plaster to create the actual production mold. I then use the plaster mold to cast porcelain vases. Unlike traditional casting here the arrangement of the mold pieces is alternated each time to produce a one-of-a-kind vase. Each piece of the mold carries a number or letter stamp, and so in each cast a unique serial number is stamped on the vase, I record these serial numbers to make sure I never make the same piece twice. The show This project will be shown in my upcoming graduation show at the Cranbrook Museum of Art that opens on April 21, 2012. I would like to produce 20 or 30 vases, which will be shown alongside the geographic location of their patrons and their names (if you agree). After the show is closed (May 14, 2012), the vases will be shipped to their owners.   \nMy commitment All the pieces will be produced in my studio, it will never be outsourced.I am committed to produce these objects myself. Their production is limited only by the unknown time I still have on this planet, and my ability to produce.  Ultimately, this project aspires to create a direct human connection between the supporters of this project and myself. I will never reproduce your unique permutation.  \nEach vase produced will be recorded in an online data base stating the patron geographic location (if patrons allow their contact info will be attached to it). This project will continue until I can no longer produce (hopefully until the day I die)   \n \nThe math  To compute the total number of unique permutations, I calculate the factorial of 13, omitting the 14th part that is used as an indicator to tell me where the serial number begins. For the first part I have 13 options to choose from, for the next one I’m left with only 12, then only 11 and so on until 1. So the total number of unique permutations equals to 13x12x11x10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 which equals 6,227,020,800. The two prototypes photographed are numbered 05642CBD7A9138, and 0D1583BCA79246. \n\nAbout me \nyou can get some more info and tons of images of my work on my website www.sharanelran.com \n \nThanks!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

The film explores the \ncharacters' intersections between identity, memory, love and projection as one seems to \nbe wrapped in his thoughts and the other searches for meaning without memory. In \norder to best explore these abstract themes, a friend of ours, Prateek \nRajbhandari, constructed a device that would allow us to shoot with up \nto four cameras simultaneously.

    "textDescription": "Story There are so many reasons this CD needs to get made. It is not about becoming the next big thing or hoping to make thousands of dollars, but about sharing and creating the music I have been working on the last couple of years. I am caught in a conundrum, playing music for veterans is healing and rewarding for me, but it does not allow me the time or money to be able to write and release the new songs that I so desperately need to.   I give all the profits from the sale of my last CD “Trying to Find My Way Home”, to the non-profit Warrior Songs I founded. All revenue from the PTSD and Veteran Suicide Prevention education and outreach performances I give through Warrior Songs goes directly to Warrior Songs, I do not take a dime. As I write, this Warrior Songs engagements make up about 95% of my musical performances. Because I give away all the revenue from the sale of my last CD, I don’t have the money to create a new CD. Without a new CD to tour in support of, I have no way of expressing my creative growth and sing new songs. In order to maintain the level of commitment I dedicate to helping veterans through my non-profit Warrior Songs I need to be able to sing the songs living inside of me that represent where I am today. The veterans work I do with my non-profit based around my last CD “Trying to Find My Way Home” will always be my number one priority, but without the ability to sing new songs and continue to grow I will burn out and be able to do neither.  I know that sharing my music with veterans is important and has also provided a good deal of healing for me in my own journey as an Iraq Vet with PTSD, but I also know that if I do not have an opportunity to take a new direction with music that is about all facets of my being, not just this war stuff, I won't progress anymore as an artist. If I do not get to make new songs, I'll be just this shell of a person stuck forever in the past. I need to achieve balance in my life; the veterans work is very stressful. I can prevent burn out if I can devote more energy to my other music.  \nI am looking to you, community for the success of this Kickstarter Campaign! If you have ever felt some connection to me: whether that was rambling around the country roads of Eagle River, listening to me play at an Oshkosh opened mic, joking with me on the back of a truck in Iraq, felt moved by my PTSD Show and how veterans suffer, please consider giving to this campaign. Please also share this campaign with as many of your friends and networks as you can. \nI know $12,000 sounds like a lot of money to make a CD, especially if you are not a musician! It costs this much and more to pay for studio time, a producer/sound engineer, studio musicians, graphic design, and then get the CD itself to print and press, not to mention all the wonderful Kickstarter rewards. $12,000 is an overwhelming amount to almost anyone, most certainly me, but if the entire community (and maybe if they spread the word!) pulled together then I think it will be possible to reach this goal. Humbly Yours, Jason Moon   Risks and challenges Like all creative projects there are obstacles that could prevent this CD from being created. The biggest one is funding. I am relying solely on this Kickstarter campaign to completely fund the creation of my new CD. I simply don’t have the resources to pay for it myself. If the Kickstarter fundraising campaign fails, the CD will not be created. There is no real way around this obstacle. Kickstarter campaigns are all or nothing, meaning if I don't reach my funding goal of $12,000 within 60 days, I don't get any funding whatsoever. This one really is do or die.\n\nAnother hurdle, though it feels silly calling her that, is the most wonderful and beautiful blessing I have ever received. I'm speaking of the recent birth on May 7, 2013 of my daughter Penelope June Moon. As all newborn babies do she requires a lot of attention and care, and I can't wait to give it to her. Once her mother returns to work after maternity leave, Penny and I will be spending a lot of time together and I will be grateful for every moment. This means however I have to really focus on time management. Coordinating the studio time and the studio musicians around the schedule of a newborn baby will be difficult. Add to that the amount of work I put in on a weekly basis for the nonprofit Warrior Songs, throw in big dose of PTSD and several spoonful’s of insomnia, mixed it all together with the cost of childcare and you don't have a lot of left over free time. Therefore, time management, and getting the most out of each recording session and rehearsal will be imperative. \n\nAnother obstacle is trying to pick 14 songs from the over 40 unrecorded songs I have written and ready to record. It's always hard to narrow it down and often times I have to seek guidance and input from those friends and fans who have listened to my music for the last 20 years. This is a good problem to have and as they say we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it, and when we finally get down to 18 songs and I can't bring myself to set 4 of them aside I will look to those of you who wish to help, allowing you to listen to the demos and choose, as the people who funded this project, to choose which songs ultimately make it on the CD.

Thanks so much for your support! Please help spread the word so we can take the project even further! Hard to Swallow: The Collection Hey Kickstarter!  We are putting together a complete collection of Dave Davenport and Justin Hall's Hard to Swallow   series, and we need your help! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Series The Hard to Swallow  anthology series was launched with a simple premise: that erotic comics should be great stories as well as being sexy. The series ran from 2006 to 2009 and featured everything from werewolves and skater ghosts to pirates and porn stars. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors drew inspiration from punk, tattoo art, indie comics, gei manga, and confessional memoir to create a strong new voice in gay erotica. They brought in guest cartoonists with each issue—BiL Sherman, Drub, Steve MacIsaac, and Brad Rader—who created their own idiosyncratic erotic tales. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGay erotic comics were a staple in the early queer underground comics scene. They presented sex and sexuality frankly, boldly, delighting in their lasciviousness and inappropriateness for convenience-store spinner racks. These comics, designed to titillate, also became a way for gay artists to find and work with each other, and celebrate the sides of themselves that society wanted kept under the covers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Northwest Press is aiming to collect the entirety of the original, out-of-print series (plus almost 50 pages of new material!) into one gorgeous book. In the new tales, Dave catches up with the sexy monsters from \"Gigantic\", his first ever porn comics tale, while Justin delves deeper into his trove of autobiographical sex stories. New guests Victor Hodge and Jon Macy join them with their own remarkable works of sex fantasy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard to Swallow is gay erotic comics made to be edgy, powerful, and personal (as well as smoking hot!). The series transcends smut into art, infusing its stories with wit, longing, and pointed commentary. It skips the stern-faced sex gods and delivers something more full of life, humor, and humanity. Hard to Swallow has inspired readers and cartoonists for 10 years, and now is finally being collected in the format it deserves. The Rewards We're offering a bunch of great rewards, centering around—of course—a copy of the Hard to Swallow collection, in digital and print formats. We've got packages for retailers as well, so they can be among the first to carry the book in their stores. For those of you who want something a little special, we've got an edition of the book signed by Justin and Dave, including a limited edition full-color bookplate tucked inside, and you'll be thanked in the book! You can also opt for a reward including original art from Justin or Dave, or even the full library of LGBT comics and graphic novels from Northwest Press  in print or digital. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Goal We're seeking $15,000 to produce a deluxe paperback edition of Hard to Swallow , which includes approximately $12,000 for printing, $1500 for Kickstarter fees, $1200 for shipping from the printer and to backers, and a few hundred more for incidentals, like printer corrections, shipping proofs, and promotional copies. \n\nThank you! Thank you so much for your support of this project! We're excited to get it into your hands. Risks and challenges Northwest Press has been publishing quality books since 2010, and we can proudly say that we deliver our Kickstarter books to our backers in a timely manner, with great transparency.\n\nWe don't foresee any major hurdles in delivering the book. The vast majority of the artwork is already finished and just needs remastering and preparation for printing, and Dave and Justin are hard at work pulling everything together.\n\nIf we reach our goal, we will go to press immediately and hope to have the books at Emerald City Comic-Con in early April, shipping to backers shortly thereafter. We work with a great printer, Marquis in Quebec who consistently delivers quality books with a great turnaround time. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story  Reflective Equilibrium: a\nphilosophical concept that refers to the final stage in a deliberative process\nof reflecting on and revising one’s moral beliefs and positions. \n\nThe Exhibition: The exhibition Reflective Equilibrium will feature drawings, paintings,\nand mixed-media works by people imprisoned in a mid-Atlantic correctional\nfacility. For the exhibiting artists, making work allows them to transcend the\nconditions of their incarceration, express emotions, and communicate their\nshared humanity to viewers, familiar and unfamiliar with the criminal justice\nsystem. \n\nThe purpose of this show is to\nencourage conversations that we have often been content to avoid, and to show\nthat the light of humanity shines even in confinement. If we remain complacent,\nthese stories and bodies of work remain invisible and inaccessible to the\nbroader society of which these artists are still a part. If relegated to the\nshadows, difficult and distasteful issues of mass confinement, dehumanization,\nand mass recidivism often remain out of sight, out of mind, and unaddressed. \n\nOur hope is that this exhibition\nwill facilitate critical thinking and improve understandings of criminal\njustice systems and processes of rehabilitation and successful re-integration\nwith society. The show will provide gallery visitors with views often\noverlooked, feared, or demonized. \n\nThe Art: The works\nin this exhibition derive from three activities: the Introductory Drawing\nclass, Unit Art, and Personal Studio Time.  The Introductory Drawing class is a twelve-week course\ntaught by an inmate instructor that introduces students to principles of\ndrawing. For the final project, students render drawings of a still life\nassembled from limited available materials. Successful completion of\nIntroductory Drawing is a prerequisite for participation in the Unit Art\nProgram, which allows individuals to work in their cells using basic drawing\nmaterials, and Personal Studio Time in the Leisure Center, which affords\ngreater access to materials and time for artists to explore and discuss more\nadvanced technical and conceptual issues. Accomplishments-to-date: \n\nWe have already undertaken\nsignificant work to make this exhibition a success. We have identified\nparticipating artists and selected works, and a Philadelphia gallery has agreed\nto rent space for the event. The participating artists are excitedly writing\nand revising their artists’ statements, which will appear in a printed catalog\nand a website documenting the exhibition and opening reception. Kickstarter\npledges will enable us to rent the gallery space, ship, mount, and stretch\nthe works, produce the catalog, promote the exhibition, and host an opening\nreception. Reflective Equilibrium is intended for exhibition purposes only—featured works\nwill not be for sale. Artists' quotes: “Art provides a safe\nplace to express ourselves and regain our autonomy under stressful conditions,\nin which one is vulnerable to the warping effects of mood and memory. Many of\nus rely on abstraction to lose track of time and place…It is the process of\ncreation that allows us to escape our immediate conditions, re-establish a\nproductive and empowered identity, and reclaim a positive life.\" \"In the life, I will create In this life, I will let color carry me away In this life, and only in this life, I will live\" “This is a plea to\nliberate the human spirit; to show the power of art…as experienced through the\nconfined voices of conscience; to show that reform is possible; to show that we\nhave made mistakes but we are still citizens before we are anything else.  Our art bridges the divide between\nimprisoned individuals and society…We are not something \"other\" to be\nfeared; we are your fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons, and we all play an\nequal part in our shared condition called humanity.\" We invite you to share in this\ncollaborative endeavor and welcome your participation.

The existing solution is the traditional top case : expensive, not very aesthetic, heavy, with an impact on driving and frequent thefts ... Be part of our project, contribute to a true innovation : pre-purchase Softcase the top case that will make your life easier ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe created Softcase to address all these problems and therefore offer you a more practical alternative, more flexible, safer, more aesthetic, to transport your things by scooter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts universal fastening strap allows Softcase to adapt on all scooter designs, all engine size, without installing a fixing plate. To adapt to all and every scooters on the market, Softcase is available with 3 models of straps : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “classic” strap for the small scooters  \nThe “Italia” strap for the Vespa range of scooters \nThe  “XL” strap for the biggest designs as, for example, T-Max Note \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasily transportable, Softcase is folding. You can retract it into his pocket for carrying by hand or slip it under your saddle ! Softcase is patented, indeed it uses a unique folding system : the \"Easy Folding Technology\" system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfolded, Softcase is 50 cm high, 30 cm wide and deep, when folded it is only 15 x 30 x 9 cm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a 40 liters capacity, you can carry easily, in total security : \n2 full face helmets  \nBag and sports accessories  \n2 packs of 6 bottles of water (1.5 liters)  \nYour shopping ... \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the strap, you can install and uninstall your Softcase in a wink !

Positioned as rear passenger, Softcase is extremely stable and does not create any overhang phenomenon while driving. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid and Stephan are both compulsive users of scooters ... Real estate agents in Paris, after many years of research to find THE best solution to transport their things by scooters, they decided to rack their brains and invent it themselves : that is how Softcase is born ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n * An email will be sent at the end of the Kickstarter campaign to choose the size of the straps and the colors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to call you in, be part of this adventure :  PRE-ORDER SOFTCASE NOW !

While  traveling heavily across there globe during our successful Kickstarter PREMIUM ONE project, we quickly figured out a real need for a mobile charging device for both , Apple Watch and iPhone. And for sure getting rid of the usual cable chaos. I met Jim Ferguson from Ratio Product Lab in Atlanta during my last Kickstarter campaign. He  had a kind of similar idea, so we both did some heavy brainstorming and finally the concept of MOVE! was born. Here is a demo animation for the concept: \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nOur intention from start was not just to do another \"charger\". The innovative product we had in mind should fit to the  philosophy of Apple products and should work with all types of Apple Watch bands. It should allow to be used with standard  cases as well. No more cable chaos and avoiding to hunt for socket power  became another important part of the concept. This was an ideal situation because we knew from our own experiences what you guys needed most and we put ourselves deeply into this and the concept of MOVE! followed us even in our dreams....:) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are very, very proud of the final product.  MOVE!, the very first wireless charger, power bank and mobile docking solution for iPhone and Apple Watch.  MOVE! serves many needs and more: \nBuilt-in Charger \nPower Bank \nDocking Station  \nTraveladapter \nNightstand Buddy  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge MOVE! and your devices at home, office, hotel - virtual any place you like. Go out, feel free and do your own stuff. Camping, Hiking, Business, Travel, Sports -You decide when and where you recharge your iPhone and Apple Watch. MOVE! will make you independent when you´re on the MOVE!   If you need a quick charge in the field, MOVE!'s integrated power bank has enough capacity to recharge your iPhone and Apple Watch in full. No searching for cables -just get MOVE! out, dock your iPhone and Apple Watch and here we go. MOVE! works as well with any Apple Watch band \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our MOVE! prototypes is testing how it feels to be in an Apple Store.

Backers from the European Union member countries, including the UK: Please read \"Production and Shipping\" further down. Your shipping charges will include the 19% VAT on the whole product amount. This will enable us to ship direct to you, no additional VAT or customs duties will occur! This is an important information for our German backers: Beim Checkout werden Euch die Versandkosten vielleicht etwas hoch vorkommen. In diesen Versandkosten sind aber bereits 19% Mehrwertsteuer auf den gesamten Produktpreis enthalten. Damit können wir Euch direkt beliefern. Es fallen weder weitere Zollkosten, noch zusätzliche Gebühren an und Ihr bekommt den MOVE! direkt zu Euch nach Hause \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightstand Mode and Stretch Goal  The best news at the end:) Well, when we disclosed the idea with our past backers of Premium One, we got a lot of valuable input and comments. Most wanted a nightstand mode, specially when traveling around and sleeping in hotels So we developed a cool extension cable set which even creates a \"Double Nightstand Mode\" . You can put your iPhone into a kind of cockpit mode. How cool is that? It perfectly fits into the modular system and reduces the need of additional plugs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were not sure how to value this, it just has been developed during the last weeks. Well, we decided to put the burden on you guys :) if we reach 100K as our stretch goal we will include the set with every MOVE! we ship. To make this happen (and we think its achievable) we need your support. Share this project with everybody you know and put it on your social networks. Together we´re strong! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Way to MOVE! - Prototype Stages \n\nWe did some pretty deep work here and spend endless hours on the project the last couple of months, hundreds of drawings, changes here, changes there \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the first idea to the final prototype we did a lot of testing. For example, to add stability to the US plug, we designed the third pin as an foldable option and since it is not connected to the circuit we made it out of pretty resistant plastic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were very creative to exchange ideas within the team........ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nWe were always trying to optimize, doing it the Steve Jobs way, minimizing dimensions and adding as much user wanted features as possible. The outside dimensions of MOVE! are pretty small, just credit card size, but we still found some space to add batteries which turn MOVE! into a power bank as well. We searched for high quality batteries and ended up with Samsung technology (Yes, this is what they are really capable of :)). All materials used are of highest quality, the integrated Lightning adapter is MFI certified and we will use original Apple magnetic charger modules. Quality first - you will get what you pay for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As well, when aiming to get approval through Apple, entering the process and reading about all the MFI/MFA requirements from Apple to integrate the charging module and lightning into one unit, we were forced to do some changes on the initial design. This wasn't that easy as we didn't just want to make it workable for iPhones without cases but also with cases on. As Apple requires a bottom support for the iphone when docked into the lightning we needed to come up with a height adjustment of the support \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final solution offers more flexibility in use, and we came up with the great \"Double-Night Stand\" idea \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our photo- and testing studio :) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype for \"Double Nightstand Mode\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting Serial Production We got a good team together and we tried to put ourselves deeply in the user`s seat, same like with our project PREMIUM ONE, which got very succesful on Kickstarter and which shipped the first units ontime as promised. So you know that execution and realization of a project isn`t something we never heard about :) What we need the money for We are ready to go into serial production. We got working prototypes which were tested extensively. A big chunk of the costs here are the tooling costs. Believe me, there are a bunch of parts involved, specially with all the switchable and foldable adapters. So for the money we are asking for we want to finance the tooling costs and the first serial units. We are right now in the process as well to get MOVE! fully certified by Apple and we starter the initial process which will require some more laboratory testing and adjustments of the electronics. Production and Shipping  We have our suppliers in position, testing and tooling will take about 9-11 weeks, first production run another 6-8 weeks. That gives us in total about 15-19 weeks, means shipping out the first units in April. Yes, not doing wrong in math :). In February, there is almost a full month of holiday in China ( that`s the place for the electronics - close to Apple`s main manufacturer for iPhones :)), so we are planning for zero production during that month We planned this very conservatively, to make sure we don't need to stretch your expectations. MOVE! comes as a one model product right know. Not offering multiple product variations makes it much smoother to fulfill. And, yes, we learned from shipping. No more exotic carrier! We will ship directly from the US by USPS priority and from Germany either by DHL or Hermes. For the European Union, you need to pay the 19% VAT which is included in the shipping at checkout, sorry for that. But this will make sure you guys in the European Union can receive the units direct, with not extra custom duty fees or VAT. All other countries, except the US, please note that there might be import charges we can't control \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but not Least This is our third Kickstarter. We failed the first one, learned out of it and made the second one a big success. We sincerely hope you are going to support us here and make this one a success, too. We can tell you by our own experience, it's an awesome product. We were really not planning to do another Kickstarter this year, but we thought we need to share this with you guys. And we really missed you already :) And here is a short personal video from Michael, He just needed to say something about  MOVE!: \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges We know what it takes to deliver on schedule. The experience in design, engineering and manufacturing for over 30 years provides a good base to handle this project, even dealing with unexpected problems.\n\nOur working prototypes are the results from months of development and testing and we are ready to move into serial production. We selected reliable suppliers with proven track records of manufacturing similar products.\n\nHowever, there is always a risk of potential delays in tooling and schedules for materials and shipping. \nThese risks can never be eliminated at 100%, even if we feel we got all issues covered. But due to our very flexible production processes we don't see here any serious obstacles we can't handle in time.\n\nWe have done a pretty successful Kickstarter before, we started shipping on time, so you can bet that we will working around the clock to get MOVE! moving.\n\nWe understand that given the opportunity to be here on Kickstarter and to get support within the community is also an obligation and we will update you frequently, as well we always will appreciate any input on the project as well.

    "textDescription": "Story Allan and I started the Marfa\nMaid Dairy with the goal to make the finest artisan goat cheese in West Texas.  To our great delight, that’s what we have\ndone. We have been overwhelmed by the response to our cheese. Repeatedly we\nhave been told “This is the best goat cheese I have ever tasted!” \n\n\nGoats Milk Feta is the best! \n \n\n \n\nMarfa, Texas is a unique place\nthat draws visitors from all over the world to visit the great modern art  museum, the Chinati Foundation, art galleries\nand enjoy the magnificent landscape of the Big Bend Region. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last two years we designed\nand built beautiful dairy building and kitchen. It is ideal for our project \nand programs.  We knew that we would not\nbe able to purchase all the equipment we needed \nat first, but could start the business with what we have.  In our second year, with our product being\nquickly accepted, Marfa Maid Dairy desparately needs a large commercial\npasteurizer  and a milking machine At\nthis point we have done almost all the milking and cheese making manually.\n \n\n\nOur dairy on the prairie \n \n\n \n\nThis is very hard work and is\nhampering us from increasing our production and satisfying the increasing\nappetite for our cheese.  With your\nsupport we can move quickly to another level of production leaving us more time\nto do the community outreach. Our programs include cheese making classes,\nschool tours, demonstrations for the 4-H kids .  Our most important program will be to develop\nan intern program to bring people from all over to live on our property, learn\nto work with the goats and help us make fine artisan cheese. \n\n\nMaking lots of cheese for a hungry audience. \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges This is West Texas. It is an amazing environment with stunning natural beauty, a rich western history, cutting edge contemporary art /music and the nicest people in the world. Our greatest challenge will be to develop a larger work base for our dairy. Allan and I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience together to this project. We have art, food, organic gardening, teaching, social work, counseling, administration, marketing, fund raising and construction in our shared background. However, the two of us can’t do all this work. seven days a week by ourselves. The new equipment will go a long ways to help us make the cheese making process more efficient. We know that we need more people to help and we are planning to initiate an internship at our dairy starting in March of 2013. We are currently working on remodeling a small structure to make a sweet little cabin for our first interns. Additional funds from this project will help with this structure. The town of Marfa has become a magnet for independent, enthusiastic people of all ages. We feel confident it will help us lure interns to this area and our project. We will use additional funds for this purpose.\n\nOur other most persistent challenge is supplying a good quality food source for our goats. In the last few years , the drought in the county has spiked feed prices to unimaginable highs. We plan to stockpile feed from this season to get us through the winter. Allan also has started growing small fields of oats to feed the goats. He will expand our fields with our grey water from the dairy to help supplement their feed. Any additional funds from this project will go to buying and growing feed. \n \nOkay, we are not young. We know that but we have always burned with a vision (together and separately) to do something that is creative, exciting and inclusive. Of the organizations we have started, of the programs we have run, of all the students we have taught, of the works of art we have created, we feel this is the most exciting, rewarding and ultimately the best thing we have ever done.

    "textDescription": "Story \nHi Everybody ! We're Alan and Kelsey, the Artistic Directors of Texture Contemporary Ballet! We're a new company that formed last year in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We had our premiere performance of \"Texture\" last summer at the New Hazlett Theater on Pittsburgh's North Side. Over our two day run we sold out two of our three shows! That was so exciting! Because we did so well last year we will do a whole week of shows this summer. We will again be performing at the New Hazlett Theater. Our project is a dance performance that we are self producing  titled “Blur”. Blur We will be bringing together 25 dancers from across the country to dance with us for Blur, professional ballet dancers that dance with such companies as Texture Contemporary Ballet, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, BalletMet, Ballet Austin, Nashville Ballet, Richmond Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Milwaukee Ballet and Colorado Ballet.We will be creating and presenting four world premiere works by choreographers Alan Obuzor, Kelsey Bartman, and Catherine Tiso, as well as a work by Gabriel Smith.Alan’s work will fuse together classical and contemporary based movement with African music.Gabriel’s piece is a duet that takes place for the most part on a 4 foot X 4 foot platform.Catherine’s piece will be based on “yin yang” a concept that deals not with opposing forces, but rather complementary opposites that exist in nature, such as hot and cold, low and high, water and fire, female and male; opposites such as these are interdependent with each other, one cannot exist without the other. The theme for Kelsey’s’ piece will be “an artist’s driving force for creation”. In order to present this she’ll be bringing together artists from different mediums, music, composition, literature, and visual arts. The challenge for this piece will be giving all the different artists artistic freedom but still holding true to her vision.We will have live music by Cello Fury and new compositions by Gabriel Smith. Cello Fury is a rock band that consists of three classically trained cellists and a rock drummer performing high-energy original music. They are set apart from your average rock bank by appealing to a diverse audience across age groups and musical interests. Continually developing their own unique style of cello rock music, cellists Simon Cummings, Ben Muñoz and Nicole Myers along with drummer David Throckmorton unleash vitality and rhythmic drive in their music and dare to venture past classical expectations. Two of the five pieces in “Blur” will be set to Gabriel Smith’s music! Gabe says of his music that it allows him to be set free into his own world where anything is possible. His process is to set down some music, and then continually layer it, he will add change and delete from it until he gets something that he is happy with. Some of his music inspirations are Phillip Glass, known for his simple and repeating sounds, a sort of minimalist approach to music, and Sigur Ros, an Icelandic, post-rock band with melodic, classical, and minimalist elements, known for the ethereal sounds they produce. Blur will be a big production that we are putting together and that means we need to do a lot of fundraising to pay for things such as dancer salaries, costumes, musicians, music rights, tech personnel, theater rental, etc. We're really hoping you can help us out with all of this. A little bit from a lot of people can add up to a lot…….. and a lot from a lot of people can add up to even more! Every little bit is deeply appreciated!  Texture We formed Texture Contemporary Ballet because we wanted to do something different, we wanted to create more opportunities for dancing and choreographing, we wanted to enhance the vibrant Pittsburgh art scene even more. Pittsburgh has a world class ballet, modern dance companies, symphony, opera, but not a contemporary ballet company of that same level. We're here to fill that gap. Our mission is to strive to enhance the Greater Pittsburgh Area by creating and presenting original movement that upholds high classical ballet standards of technique and skill within a more diverse and contemporary style. Our artists express creativity and passion through the process of collaboration and performance, in an attempt to inspire an appreciation of dance and enliven and educate the public. Our artistic vision is to strive to make dance that is appreciated by dancers and non-dancers, to inspire dancers, teachers, directors, choreographers, audience members, and artists of every kind, by presenting ballet in a way that many people have never seen it before. We think that it is important to be able to break through preconceived notions that people may have when they come to see ballet for the first time. In addition, we think that it is important to fulfill the expectations of people that are frequent theatergoers and deeply submerged in the world of dance. We work to create a company of artists that think for themselves and work together as a group. We believe that in the studio and on the stage we need to create an environment where all artists can thrive, grow, and learn from each other, be they dancers, choreographers, musicians, or designer. When artists are able to share their passion and energy with each other and an audience, they can create something that is more than the sum of its parts and touch people in an expanded way.In our choreography we like to incorporate the aesthetics of ballet with a more contemporary and diverse pallet of movement. We like to bring out different dynamics in the music, and play with different qualities of timing and movement. We move dancers through space to present movement, energy, and passion.

I have plenty of project ideas to keep the students engaged, but what they are showing the most interest in is painting and we need canvas. My goal is to be able to buy enough canvas for each student to do at least one individual mixed media project and enough watercolor paper for a couple of works each, in addition to a sketch book for each child. This group of kids represent an under served youth  and they are so hungry for all things art, please help us feed this need! Risks and challenges We actually need closer to $500 to pull off purchasing all three items we desire, but I do have a small supply budget to put toward these materials and I really want to see this project funded, hence the smaller initial goal.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacopo Ridolfi Shoes is a new proposal, based on ancient Italian traditions. We make shoes: every day we create unique products, made in Italy with premium quality materials, handmade and hand-painted  with care. Ridolfi is our family name, our story : we are working to grow and turn a family business into a new brand, in order to offer high quality products crafted by the last artisans and shoemakers of our country. We care a lot about art , craft and comfort . We believe in making unique products, for those who want to live as individuals and stop existing as consumers , moved only by the imposed fashion of the moment. We are excited \nand we dream to make shoes as unique as the people who are going to wear them .  Our brand looks after the whole production , from leathers selection, through model design and hand paint operations, to the sale of an authentic Italian handmade product. \nEach shoe is unique and tells many stories : that of Italian fine materials used to create it, together with the craftsmanship and the inspiration that leads to the combination of bold colours. Above all, it tells the taste of those who choose it. Get yours and walk with us ! \n\n\nJoin us! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are artisans . Our main inspirations come from art and nature. It’s not just about the shape, we strongly believe that hand-painted colour makes every shoe a distinguished and unique piece, looking back to the great tradition of Italian art .  We make our shoes with absolute care and we like to explore the infinite range of creative possibilities, paying serious attention to the research and the quality of top level materials, together with care of comfort (i.e. wide fit and high toe ). Our classic Oxford and Derby models are handmade , with a personal touch : unique combinations of materials (leather and suede , gloss and matte finish ) and colours.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur shoes are extraordinarily comfortable, breathable (yes, your feet are really safe) and long-lasting . Colours and materials make these products quite polished, but also wearable for an original touch in everyday life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWood is our great inspiration for this collection, so why should we use a normal box?  \"Take care\" also means pack our shoes in a wooden box , handmade by other local artisans, where we always put a little mid-soft brush and a jar of delicate conditioning cream .  Someone gives stretch goals in order to increase the number of backers... We want to be different from the beginning and do not want to deny our customers, even if they will be only a few, to get something beautiful that can be appreciated. Our care is your love .  \n\n\nOur packaging for you! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong story short: because of the industrial process, all the leather shoes of the world are made with leathers already colored in tannery. Leathers usually go inside an automatic spraying paint machine , a big tunnel where they get painted by airbrush and then dried inside an oven. Shoemakers normally buy colored leather from tanneries and then they work it (cutting and assembling, making the shoes). We start from a completely different concept . We buy white leather  from tannery, then we cut it , hand paint it (yes, one by one!) and assemble it . In our method the colour follows the shape of the shoe and the line (not the opposite), creating a design which is unique and impossible to realize in any other industrial way. It's a process that requires more time and more craftsmanship : the final result is stunning, and unique. Then, selling directly to our backers and customers, with no retail increase, we are able to keep affordable prices . Have you ever felt the difference? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(At the present time we are able to produce a maximum of 30 pieces per day, so we set the delivery timeline according to this productive capacity). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we guarantee a product entirely handmade and crafted in Italy , step by step. This is our commitment and our cultural challenge .\nFor us, the brand “Made in Italy” is a promise of beauty and high quality . Italy is inspiring . We see centuries of history, art and culture all over the land, in each beautiful city and little town. We enjoy unique colours, shapes, flavours and views.  Wouldn’t it be nice to be part of it? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer our best to all backers and we believe that is much more than just buying a pair of premium shoe in a lovely wooden box at an affordable price . At any pledge level we will add every backer to our fidelity mailing list , to get exclusive newsletters and access to limited offers in the future. We want you to be part of our vision, so we will send also tips for maintenance and enjoyable insights into our inspirations (and Italy). This is our dream and our chance, to make unique shoes and belts for unique people : get your chance . Look over the rewards and read the pledge descriptions  for more details (and feel free to contact us). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince every foot is different , we will send to all our backers a simple chart and ask for 2 measurements (in addition to the request of the usual shoe size ): this little check will provide the best fit . All our shoes are true to size and very comfortable (with wide fit). \n\n\nWe will send you a survey, at the end of the campaign, to find out your exact size. \n \n\n \n\n\n You can download the chart here . \n\n\nMix & match! New rewards added! \n \n\n \n\n\nWe want to do more and give you a world of different and unique possibilities . We like the details and we know you all need beautiful accessories , so we launch here on Kickstarter our collection of premium quality leather belts , handmade and hand-painted one by one, as our shoes are!  We can do something special: paint shoes and belts together, in the same phase of the making process, to obtain unique matching products . The possibilities are endless and this is why we like our work: have you already chosen your style? Take a look to the rewards, and choose yours! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWouldn't it be nice to do something more, and have something more? Help us reach our stretch goals, so that we can do even better and give you more unique products! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reached our funding goal, so we want to give you more products and (this is important) to introduce a combowith another quality handmade local brand .\n\n  \nWith the #1 stretch goal (25.000€) , we would be able to include in each order a nice duster bag (with our logo) made of natural cotton: this could be useful to keep your shoes and protecting them while traveling. \nWith the #2 stretch goal (35.000€) , we would be so glad to include in each order a beautiful match: the unique bracelets made by our artisan friends of Lasko Lifestyle . We are proud to introduce you this exclusive opportunity: more products really made in Italy, one by one, with great care. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLasko Lifestyle is a small handcrafting studio  based near Verona: they offer stylish bracelets , inspired by an original, sophisticated and creative lifestyle, perfect for travelers and outdoor enthusiasts . Each bracelet is handmade with quality materials and comes with a great packaging. Both their collections look great with our shoes: \"Materia \", made with colored leather laces , inspired to a dynamic and original lifestyle; and \"Porto \", made with paracord , inspired to outdoor lifestyle and action sport. Each Lasko bracelet comes with a handmade stamp rough cotton bag. There's more! For this occasion, Lasko offer a preview of the next leather collection, \"Terra \", even more sophisticated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exclusive match, you could have a nice Lasko with every pairof Jacopo Ridolfi shoes you order! If we reach the stretch goal, we will send a survey for Lasko too, asking for model, colour and size of your wrist. Every bracelet is handmade, with your perfect size! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe strongly believe in this artisanal local combo, could be a great match and an exclusive opportunity for you. Take the chance and share the news, we are waiting for you! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the campaign is funded, we will first send the surveys (style, colour and size) and hope to receive soon them back from all backers in July/August 2016. So, the faster we get them back, the sooner we start making your shoes, of course! Approximately, we will procede through production in 8 weeks, and then shipping in 3 weeks (by October/November 2016). \n\n\nWe will make sure that you get what you ordered! \n \n\n \n\n\n In our timeline we wanted to consider a safety margin, but we can say that we will start the production immediately and probably the first orders could be processed even during summer (and then gradually). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood things come to those who wait . At the present time we are able to produce a maximum of 30 pieces per day , so we set the delivery timeline according to this productive capacity . We always put a strong effort in order to satisfy all our customers, but please consider that every piece is handmade and hand-painted (so, i t's worth a little waiting for). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHi, this is me, Jacopo. \n \n\n \n\n\n1957 : My mother, Nicoletta, begin her adventure working in the shoe district of Verona, discovering how to choose the best materials, to be familiar with shapes and models. She learn a precious handmade tradition, that turns into passion and family business.\nAs all stories are, this is made of experiences, inspirations, encounters .  2016 : From a family business to a new local brand, hopefully.

We have a long experience in high quality manufacturing and we are prepared to confront any new situation, included this one. We are sure about every step and we know what to do.\n\nThe most common risk in our work is production delays. The manufacturing process relies on several components and cooperations with other parts (mostly with our suppliers). There is always the possibility of a slight delay. \n\nHowever, we will be providing updates every step of the way. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

When she joins them on a high-stakes treasure hunt, she begins to transform based on your choices. Play the Demo now!  In The Pirate’s Fate , Mila and the Dread Pirates hunt for magical treasure. You’ll navigate stormy seas, seedy saloons and monstrous coves in search of loot. And be warned: you aren’t the only pirates seeking this treasure! \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choices you make will transform the protagonist, other characters, and the story itself. The game keeps track of what you’ve done, and different plot elements and romances will open or close accordingly. There are multiple branching story paths and secret endings for your journey. What will be your fate? \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not as simple as choosing good or evil. Each choice you make will rest on different conflicting values such as loyalty vs. individualism, empathy vs. pragmatism, etc. For example, should you honor your word and share your treasure with a crewmate, even if you’re sure that having the treasure will lead them into harm’s way? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of your crewmates have their own moral compass, separate and distinct from your own. \n\nFor example, you can’t decide you’re going to “go evil” to get in the good graces of a particular character, such as Morgana. Her view of morality is different than Mila’s. You'll have to understand her perspective to impress her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pirate’s Fate will feature a wide variety of transformations, many of which showcase non-traditional body types and presentations. Mila will have the opportunity to romance all of the main characters.  In many dating games, romances are governed by an “affection meter,” which goes up or down based on how much the character you are pursuing approves of your actions. In The Pirate’s Fate, there will be multiple paths towards romancing the same character depending on your choices throughout the game.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThese different paths will show how different kinds of relationships are possible with the same person. Some romances feature their own transformations. Romantic interactions will include a variety of relationship types, including those across the LGBT spectrum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more support we receive, the more features we will add to the game, such as upgrading the artwork to include dynamic poses: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is our current stretch goal treasure map: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Voice acting will allow special scenes to be narrated, and a feature graphic novel will detail a new transformation journey for the Dread Pirates.  Now that we've been funded and we hit our first stretch goal, dynamic poses, we've announced new stretch goals: \"Shape What You Were.\" If we reach this new stretch goal, we’ll introduce a new type of treasure: a mystical mirror that allows you to travel back to an important point in someone’s past, and have the power to change what happened, impacting the story going forward. We're also going to do fully animated transformation cutscenes if we can hit $17,000. Custom rewards can include having your own custom character or fursona appear as a cameo in the game!  The Team: T.F. Wright (Writer/Programmer/Co-Creator) : T.F Wright is the author of the My Transformations story site who has written 30 transformation themed ebooks on Amazon.  Volkenfox (Artist/Co-Creator) : Volkenfox is an an artist and illustrator who has created over 1000 anthro/transformation themed works on Fur Affinity and Deviant Art.  Vdisco (Background Arist): Vidisco is a professoinal artist and graphic designer who will be desinging the logo and all of the background images for The Pirate's Fate. His art is in our updated demo. Rourkie (Composer) : Our original soundtrack will be composed by experienced musician Rourkie. His music is our updated demo .  \n\n\nVidisco also designed this beautiful logo \n \n\n \n\n\nOther Ways to Help : Share this game on social media to help spread the word! And thanks for helping us get Greenlit on Steam! \n\n\nWe've been Greenlit on Steam! \n \n\n \n\n\n  Risks and challenges The main risk with indie projects are delays - simply being unable to get the work done fast enough. We know many of these types of projects have languished for years, even after successful funding.\n\nHowever, T.F. Wright and Volkenfox have a track record of producing content together, on time. We have created illustrated stories every two months for the past year, and before that, we have years of private commissions for stories and artwork. We also have a network of other creators who could step in and help in the event one of us is somehow unable to complete their share of the work.\n\nOnce we are funded, we will provide regular updates so that you can see our progress Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story I hope to record an album, singing classical songs and music from theater, television and film. It will represent the music that inspires me to sing and touches my heart. The album will be produced in a professional studio with live musicians and personalized orchestrations, making each song unique.   I plan to include 10-15 tracks on this CD. I have been singing my entire life, and in 2013, I was selected as a finalist out of 75,000 acts to sing on stage in Las Vegas for America's Got Talent. This album represents the next step in my journey as a performer. In addition to producing  and distributing the CD, I will be marketing my songs on my website (www.joyweiser.com) as well as on iTunes. This album will help me share my music and voice with a broader audience.   Thank you for your support of my dream. Risks and challenges After a lifetime of singing, and for many of those years professionally, this is my first attempt recording a complete and comprehensive musical body of work. So often I am asked for a CD of my singing, and I am left with an answer that has left me embarrassed. With this album, I will now be able to share some of my favorite songs and arrangements.\n\nI am very excited to get into the process of producing my first complete album and learn copyright laws and licensing, recording studio practices, and working with a producer and arranger. In addition, I am up to the challenge and am prepared for managing studio costs, musician costs, costs of producing (duplicating, graphic design, mixing and mastering, and photography), as well as post-production marketing. \n\nThe largest challenge for me has been to select the best songs and arrangements for the album. My goal is to appeal to the broadest audience, while still being true to the message I want to share. I have enjoyed the process over the last year of searching through over a thousand songs to select the right ones for my debut album.\n\nI hope with my broad range, after all I am an Alto who loves to sing High C, I can offer songs you will enjoy and with original arrangements. \n\nMy dream is to give the listener a piece of my heart in every song.

    "textDescription": "Story William Schaff is an artist living in Warren, RI.  He's responsible for many a piece of fine art, including album covers from some of the top indie bands you know and love. I am a fella who runs a small recording label and record store in Savannah, GA., Graveface Records. For 5 years I have been trying to find an extra $15,000 to put out a high quality, fine art book that collects the artwork William Schaff has done for bands and musicians over the years.  Every time it looks like I have the money, something comes up.  Thanks to the wonders of you and Kickstarter, this might actually happen now.  The idea is simple; make a beautiful 11x11 hardcover art book of at least 60 pages featuring Schaff's music related artwork from childhood until now. An introduction by John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats and intros to different sections by such notables as Will Sheff of Okkervil River and Darren Jackson of Kid Dakota help describe how these images came into existence. But wait, music fans...there's more! The icing on the cake is the 10\" that Jason Molina [Songs: Ohia, Magnolia Electric Co.] recorded specifically for this project a few years back.  These songs have never been released on anything else! They're incredible, and it's been quite difficult not letting anyone hear them for so long. The money will be spent as follows: Manufacturing an 11x11, 60+ page Hardcover art book (100lb full color pages, 120pt board for cover plus foil stamping) & the 10\" Jason Molina vinyl. It should also be stressed that due to Jason's kindness years ago with writing/recording the songs for the record, 10% of every dollar earned is going to help Mr. Molina out with current, overwhelming medical bills. That's right - not only are you making this wonderful book possible, but you'll be helping a wonderful man who has brought this world so much incredible music. If we are blessed enough to exceed our goal of $14,040, the extra money will go to make this book beyond incredible. If we transcend our goals, the additional money will be spent as follows: Adding a dust jacket, upgrading the paper, creating a sleeve for the inside back cover to hold the 10\", paying our graphic design team, keeping our electricity on and so on.  There are posters, colored test pressings, a pre-order of the book itself (duh!), a G.G. Allin coloring book and many more fun items up for grabs! It should be said that we really appreciate your support - be it $1, $2,000 or just well wishes.  It means the world to me given the cruel conditions of our daily existences. That was heavy.   Wiff wuv, Ryan Graveface p.s. Please hit me up if you have any questions, and thanks again.  p.p.s.

    "textLength": 8143,
    "textDescription": "Story River City Farm \n\n\n\n\n\nRiver City Farm is a half-acre, organic vegetable farm in the city of Lewiston in northwestern Idaho. We will market our produce locally, through a CSA program, at the farmers' market, and wholesale to small businesses. Our first growing season will begin this coming spring!  My name is Keegan Athey. I am a farmer, river guide, and soon to be graduate from Colorado State University with a B.S. in Soil and Crop Science and a minor in Organic Agriculture.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe farm is my dream and project. While I have several years of organic, small-scale vegetable production experience, River City Farm will be my first business management venture. What better way to learn, than to do?  \n\n\n\n\n\nOur Main Objectives \nTo grow fresh, nutritious, local produce \nTo support Lewiston's local food system and economy \nTo serve as an experiential education resource for the\nLewiston community \nTo grow our food and our business sustainably and responsibly \nTo serve as a springboard for future farms and enterprises  \n What We Have Many of the resources needed to make River City Farm a reality are already in place. \n\nLand : Curt Chang, a local business owner, is generously donating a half-acre plot of his land to be used for the farm. Our soil is fertile and we have access to high-quality, inexpensive irrigation water. \n\nLabor : While I will supply the majority of the labor for the farm, my super tough sister, Dory, my amazingly patient partner, Mike, and my best friend, Charlie, will be helping me get River City Farm off the ground. Some star volunteers from the Lewiston community and OARS & Dories will also be involved.  \n\nMarketing Infrastructure : I've been hard at work for the last year developing both a local Lewiston community and an online community. Folks can currently visit our facebook page for frequent farm updates, check out our website for farm information or to read our blog, and receive our monthly newsletter . \n\nEquipment : Curt is also generously allowing me to rent his tractor, implements, and other equipment for use on the farm.  \n\nHoophouse : I received a grant from Aurora Organic Dairy that will be used to build a small hoophouse (also called a caterpillar tunnel) for transplant production and season extension. \n\nSupporters : River City Farm already has an amazingly supportive community, both in and out of Lewiston. These people have and will continue to be an integral part of our success.  \n\nHard Work : Anyone who knows me will tell you, if nothing else, that I work extremely hard.  \n\nPassion : I believe that creating a more localized and sustainable agricultural system is essential for the resilience of our ecosystems, economies, and communities. I am honored to be a part of the local food movement and to support the sustainability of Lewiston's food system.  \n What We Need \n\n\n\n\n\nThis campaign is only for the initial start up cost of the farm. Other costs for seed, organic fertilizers, pest control, fuel, labor, and transplant production are not included. These additional expenses will be funded by two grants I received from Aurora Organic Dairy, as well as significant personal investment. Costs for future growing seasons will be funded by previous years' revenues and more personal investment. Again, we are only asking for Kickstarter pledges for our first year, start-up costs. Once those costs are funded, the farm can begin to pay for itself. What If We're Overfunded? Based on the incredible amount of support River City Farm has received on Kickstarter, I have added this section to explain what we can accomplish if the campaign raises more than $5,000. There is considerable interest in local, Lewiston eggs. After developing several budgets, I have determined the start up costs for two sizes of egg production operations.  $5500 : River City Farm could add a 10 hen egg production operation, producing approximately 155 dozen eggs/year for the Lewiston community. ($500 over initial funding goal).  $6000 : River City Farm could add a 30-hen egg production operation, producing approximately 465 dozen eggs per year for the Lewiston Community. ($1000 over initial funding goal). I am egg-static about the prospect of bringing chickens to River City Farm. They will be a great addition to our operation. Who I'm Grateful For I am blessed with a wonderful and supportive community. I would like to acknowledge some of those people here.  Thank you to Charlie Blackmer, who made our Kickstarter video, designed the website, set up the blog, and continues to show enthusiasm and commitment to this project.  Thank you to Curt Chang, who first approached me about starting a market farm in Lewiston. Since then he has generously offered his land, equipment, time, and advice. Curt is also responsible for naming the farm. River City Farm would not exist without him.  Thank you to my patient and endlessly supportive boyfriend, Mike Kittel. Thank you to my family: Dory, Kerry, Steve and Patti for their unwavering love and support. Thank you to the Lewiston community, especially the folks at University of Idaho Extension and OARS & Dories. Thank you also to all of the friends, family, teachers, and employers who have pushed me to pursue this project. And thank you for checking out River City Farm's kickstarter campaign! Risks and challenges Farming is a risky business. Farmers have to make business and production decisions based on estimated and unknown factors. Markets crash, weather is unpredictable, crop varieties underperform, labor is unavailable, water is scarce. Starting a farm also requires significant initial investment, with little return in the first few years. \n\nAs a small-scale market farmer, I face additional challenges. Because Lewiston does not have a well-developed local food system, consumers may be unaware of of farmers' market and CSA opportunities. They also could be hesitant to pay the premium prices associated with local and organic produce. \n\nThe solution to these marketing problems is consumer education. I will have to work extra hard to gain supporters for the local food as a whole, not just for my farm. This involves constant participation at the farmers' market, as well as involvement in other local food projects. I have been a part of community discussions regarding the construction of a downtown, accessible community garden and a local seed bank. When I return to Lewiston I will continue participating in these efforts. \n\nAnother significant challenge that I face as a new farmer is my inexperience. I have production experience in a climate very similar to Lewiston, but not in Lewiston itself. There are likely nuances regarding Lewiston's growing conditions that I am unprepared for. I also have little experience managing a business and will undoubtably make some poor business decisions. \n\nFor the last year, I have been trying to prepare for business and production management of River City Farm. I've taken business planning classes, written a complete business plan and budget, met with business development counselors, worked on similar-sized farms, and asked millions of questions. Though I know that this knowledge is not equal to experience, I believe I have prepared myself to the best of my ability. In addition, I have over-calculated my production costs and under-calculated my revenues to better absorb those inevitable mistakes. I also have a strong support system in place and have numerous people that I can call for advice and assistance. \n\nWhile I understand that starting a farm is a risky and formidable enterprise, I also know that I am up for the task. River City Farm is my dream and I have spent countless hours considering every aspect of the project. I am passionate, hard-working, and have an amazing support system to rely on. To become a part of this support network and make River City Farm a reality, make your kickstarter pledge to our farm and share our campaign with your friends.\n\nThank you so much for your interest in this project.

Take pictures of people that you see wearing Neckties that are too short or too long and post them online using the following hashtags: #LengthMatters #TieQ @TieQ_System \n\n\n\n\n\n When it comes to tying a necktie... the frustration isn't learning to tie a specific knot type, such as The Windsor or The Pratt. The frustration is getting the end of your tie to be the correct length... which is right at the top of your belt buckle. So when I say this product system was developed out of frustration... that's exactly what I mean! It would literally take me on average, 3 - 4 attempts to get my tie length just perfect... and everyone knows (or should know) your tie can make or break how you look, especially if your tie is too long or too short.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe above pictures are a good examples of what NOT to do! Now imagine you're in a hurry, probably already late, and don't have the time to screw around with your necktie... can you feel the frustration? SOUND FAMILIAR??? So I think you get the point! Length absolutely does matter... and the perfect necktie length, or the sweet spot, is right at the top of your belt buckle. \n\n\n\n\n\nI knew from the countless hours of tying my neckties, that the length of my necktie had to do something with the \"point\" at where I began tying my tie. My solution, before TieQ existed, was to put pieces of tape on the back of my neckties as a reference marker so I knew where to \"start\" tying my tie to get that perfect length.  This was awesome, no doubt... But it only worked on me because my reference point was found by trial and error. There was no system... and I had no way to replicate my outcomes. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY... What if there was a formula that anyone can use with any knot type? Well, now there is. TieQ is a patent pending kit and method for tying a necktie. BOOM! TieQ is a simple system that anyone can use to find their TieQ Length, which is the \"reference point\" for where to start tying your necktie. In turn, you will end up with the perfect length each and every time! The beauty of TieQ, is you only have to use the system once in your life and it works with every knot type!  Once you know your reference point, you can put one of the provided TieQ markers on every Tie that you own.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole idea and concept behind TieQ, is to stop the frustration and enable anyone (well me first), at any level of experience, to tie their necktie only once and to achieve that perfect, customized length, every time!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges 1.

All designs have been prototyped, tested and revised where necessary.\n--- 2) Production-related risks: Low. We have an experienced production partner, who knows our material and creates game accessessories themselves. They created our prototypes and compatibility of our files is secured. We are agreed on und have planned a timeslot for estimated volume of orders.\n--- 3) Fulfillment-related risks: Low. With Happyshops we have an experienced logistics partner, who fulfills their own crowdfunding projects from \"Spieleschmiede\" and also other Kickstarter creators. Our project is arranged and scheduled.\n--- 4) Personnel-related risks: Low. Theoretically one of us could drop out due to health, family-related or other issues. But then the other one would take over project handling. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

My life has never been the same since.   My name is Bill Grady, and I'm a professional singer, guitarist, and songwriter from Chicago, IL.  I'm incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to perform all sorts of different genres of music for a living.  I've played in a 14-piece reggae band, a blues trio, a New-Orleans brass-band, a nationally-recognized hip-hop group, and everything in-between.  Of all the music I create, however, nothing feels closer to my heart than playing slide guitar, especially in a roots-Americana setting.  This album is my chance to forever document my love of this art and make something that is purely and truly my own vision. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy debut solo effort is titled Nothing Runs Free , and it's a twelve-track concept album that tells the story of The Wanderer, a broken soul looking to find the courage to confront his fears and journey back home to his native Louisiana.  Each track on the record draws influences from a different flavor of acoustic music, including the bluegrass-tinged rhythms of \"Feet Don't Fail Me Now,\" the beautiful classical melody of \"Annie's Waltz,\" the low-down bluesy swagger of \"Train Came Right on Time,\" or the New Orleans flavor of \"French Quarter Mile.\"  Musicians on the record include Grammy-nominated harmonica player Billy Branch , violinist for the Infamous Stringdusters Jeremy Garrett , banjo player for Cornmeal Wavy Dave , as well as the amazing musicians that comprise nationally renowned Grateful Dead cover band Terrapin Flyer .  Working with each of these musicians has been an unforgettable experience, both professionally and musically. With the album all but finished, I'm asking you all to help fund the last few steps of this process: \nFinal mixing and mastering \nAlbum Artwork \nVinyl pressing \nPromotion of the Album \nAlbum release show in Spring 2017 \n This record is my baby, and I want all of you to be a part of the joy I'll feel when I get to share my music with everyone who wants to hear it.  Thank you for checking out my Kickstarter, and I look forward to everyone getting to enjoy my music in 2017. All the best, Bill Grady Risks and challenges This is my second time working with Kickstarter. I had no problems with my most recent endeavor, but if I do encounter any problems I am more than prepared to deal with them in a professional and timely manner.

Although we all struggle with the decision, the truth is right now in this country only 6% of kids will grow up in a traditional family, meaning two straight people who get married, have kids and don't separate. The doc (which was cut on a deferral by Academy Award nominee Jim Klein because he believed so strongly in it) takes the viewer on an intimate journey from the bizarreness of picking the genetic material of your child over the Internet to the creation of joyous alternative families of both adopted and biological children. On the way, it looks at changing paradigms of why people are getting married and what makes a family. \nThe project has been endorsed by Jane Mattes, head of single mothers by choice, and Mikki Morrissette, head of Choice Moms, but we still need to raise the last finishing funds to do a color correct and license the archival footage.

From moving to America at the age of 15 and leaving my life behind in Japan, to my father passing away which acted as the most poignant reminder that life does end one day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every year I worryingly become a little more like my mother.

As long as we live, it is a fact of nature we cannot deny or hide from. To think about our mortality is to confront our lives. It'll be amazing, on our death bed, if we could feel content and our last thought to be - \"I had a good life\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKikuchiyo-san represents those of whom are often left behind and neglected in the race to live, those who have to find ways to navigate through the obstacles and struggles within the modern world, and those brave enough to face its challenges. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPocko Editions will produce, publish and distribute the limited edition book and coordinate the book launch and exhibitions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis campaign has been launched with a large scale projection at the closing night of the MOPLA - at the Leica Gallery in Los Angeles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"Photographer Kyoko Hamada Spent Two Years Pretending To Be An Elderly Woman, And Here's What She Learned\" \nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/18/kyoko-hamada-elderly-woman_n_7307610.html?1431973577# \n\"Artist Spent 2 Years Wearing Makeup, Wigs And Thrift Store Clothes To Look Like An Old Lady\" \nhttp://aplus.com/a/kyoko-hamada-photographs-herself-as-elderly-lady \n\"This New Yorker Has Spent The Last Two Years Disguised As An Old Woman Photographing Her Imagined Existence In The City\" \nhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/marthathursday/this-new-yorker-has-spent-the-last-two-years-disgu-1k0ux \n\"New York Woman Says Disguise Taught Her What It Feels Like to Be Elderly\" \nhttp://abcnews.go.com/US/york-woman-disguise-taught-feels-elderly/story?id=31152016 \nTHE FUTURE CALLS TO THE PRESENT: “I USED TO BE YOU” \nhttp://blog.gallerystock.com/2015/05/21/the-future-calls-to-the-present-i-used-to-be-you/ \n\"Photographer has pretended to be an old lady for TWO YEARS to capture how differently the elderly are treated\" \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3087278/Photographer-Kyoko-Hamada-pretended-old-lady-Used-You.html#comments \n\"Artist Confronts Mortality With Elderly Alterego\" \nhttp://magazine.good.is/articles/artist-confronts-mortality-with-elderly-alterego \n\"Why this young photographer lives a double life as an elderly woman\" \nhttp://hellogiggles.com/photographer-lives-double-life/ \n\"I Used To Be You\" \nhttp://www.examiner.com/article/i-used-to-be-you \n\"Photographer Kyoto Hamada creates an alter ego for ongoing project\" \nhttp://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/kyoto-hamada \n\"Elderly Alter-Ego Photography\" \nhttp://www.trendhunter.com/trends/i-used-to-be-you \n\"Time travel: The art of an older me\" \nhttp://cnnphotos.blogs.cnn.com/category/kyoko-hamada/ \n\"Kyoko Hamada's Self Portraits Imagine What Her Life Will Be Like in 30 Years\" \nhttp://www.featureshoot.com/2013/05/kyoko-hamadas-self-portraits-imagine-what-her-life-will-be-like-in-30-years/ \n\"Kyoko Hamada: I Used To Be You\" \nhttp://www.photoint.net/news-67-1.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKikuchiyo-san is a fictional character. Rather than being in my comfort zone behind the camera, I am the subject facing the lens. The back and forth of Kikuchiyo-san being in her own home and out in the world—and the still lifes which are interspersed throughout—bring to mind my tendency to ponder things that are right in front of me, as well as things I will never understand. \n\nUnlike the feeling evoked by the painting in Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, looking at Kikuchiyo-san in the mirror caused me to feel a mixture of humility, humour and a sense of tender familiarity. I’m not sure when my interest in ageing started, though I can think of several reasons why it is now on my mind. Small losses like my favorite corner café being replaced by a chain drug store and finding the first few strands of grey in my hair. Or, bigger losses like death of my father and the earthquake disaster in Japan. In June, Kikuchiyo-san will have been with me through four seasons; a reminder that time and life are always moving. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Born in Tokyo, Kyoko Hamada  relocated to West Virginia when she was fifteen and graduated from the Pratt Institute studying photography and painting. Her subject matter has often been the ordinary, stylized and staged into subtle quiet moments dealing with self-referentiality and various metaphors. \n \nHamada has exhibited her work in the National Portrait Gallery (UK), Randall Scott Gallery, Civilian Art Projects, and Michael Hoppen Gallery UK), among others. Her latest series, “I Used To Be You” recently received the grand prize from the Lens Culture International Exposure Awards, and was also included in the Critical Mass Top 50. \nShe has been working as a  photographer for the last 10 years; her clients include Vitra, Uniqlo and Kärcher along with several magazines including The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Telegraph Magazine, T Magazine, DuJour, and Wall Street Journal Magazine.  \nShe lives and works in New York City. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The risks and challenges when publishing an artist book include the possibility of delay, but Pocko Editions has 15 years experience at dealing with the production and printing challenges involved in making very special books. If this campaign is successful, I would do everything possible to make sure the book is published in December 2015. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Duo Concertante is very passionate about new music , and we have commissioned over twenty new works for violin and piano from many of Canada’s leading composers. The Duo Concertante albums Wild Honey (2005) and Wild Bird (2010) consist entirely of new Canadian works written for the duo and Schafer’s Duo for Violin and Piano as recorded on Wild Bird won the 2011 JUNO for Classical Composition of the Year .  Over the last 15 years, we have welcomed every opportunity to perform as concerto soloists with orchestra . As there are very few violin and piano double concertos other than the Mendelssohn, we commissioned -- with the assistance of the Canada Council – a double concerto by Andrew P. MacDonald . This highly energetic, dramatic and beautiful work was premiered with the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra and we have had additional performances with orchestras in PEI and Nova Scotia.  (Andrew is also a JUNO award winner - for his fabulous Violin Concerto.) We believe a recording featuring this wonderful new concerto alongside the rarely heard “with winds” version of the Mendelssohn makes for a compelling and important disc . We are delighted that conductor Marc David and the Newfoundland Symphony want to undertake it with us.  The project will take place September 24 to 27 in the excellent acoustics of DF Cook Recital Hall in St John’s NL . \n\nWe are thrilled that Montreal’s Carl Talbot will be acting as the project’s recording producer, engineer and editor . St John’s sound engineer Stephen Lilly will assist him. Carl is a well-established audio professional whose productions have received nominations, honours, and awards including Grammy, Juno, Felix, Gramophone Critics’ choice awards , Diapason d’Or , and many more. Since 2008, he has held the premiere position with Kent Nagano and the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal as their sound recording engineer and is currently the leading producer at Analekta, Canada’s largest classical label.\n\n We are confident that the recording will draw attention to these two wonderful double concertos and that Marquis Records will release this recording as they have worked with us numerous times in the past.

Recording with a large ensemble means limited time for the recording sessions (otherwise it's just too costly). For this reason, everyone on the team has to be incredibly well prepared. We are very fortunate to work with an amazing sound engineer and producer who is very experienced recording orchestras. We also plan to record every rehearsal leading up to the sessions in order to listen back and prepare the best we can with the aim of avoiding any problems during the real recording sessions.

We are excited to be getting closer to the release of our second album. We have created an original programme of modern works by living composers, none of which have been released before, and we can't wait to bring this exciting contemporary music to life and share our new project with you. In order to reach as wide an audience as possible with our music, we aim to release our CD through the label Encora. For this to happen we need your support. As a quartet we love to perform a wide range of music from ancient baroque transcriptions to brand new commissions. Our debut album La Danza  (2014) is a collection of lively dances from different styles and temperaments. To compliment this album we decided to develop a programme of purely modern music. We have chosen five pieces by excellent living composers, two of which were commissioned by Sirocco Quartet. We are committed to the promotion of new music for our instrument and these talented composers greatly enrich the saxophone's somewhat limited repertoire. Through the vast array of colours, textures, sounds, harmonies and noises explored in these works, the saxophone comes alive and is truly in its element.

Unser Album \"La Danza \" (2014) beinhaltet eine Sammlung von Tänzen aus ver- schiedenen Musikstilen und Stimmungen. Als Kontrast zu \"La Danza\" wollten wir für die neue CD ein rein zeitgenössisches Programm erstellen. Wir haben fünf Stücke von herausragenden lebenden Komponisten ausgesucht, von denen zwei für unser Quartett geschrieben wurden. Die neuen Komponisten bereichern das begrenzte Repertoire für Saxophonisten sehr.\nWir möchten, dass jeder diese inspirierende, fantastische Musik hören kann.  Die Kompositionen erwecken das umfangreiche Farben-, Klangs-, Harmonie-, und Geräuschspektrum des Saxophons zu neuem Leben. \nThilo Schaller (Germany.

    "textDescription": "Story UPDATE: Starting today, you can add the 84-page NSFW eComic to any pledge level! Find out more! Evil Inc is a daily comic strip about a corporation that's run by supervillains. It follows the daily lives of supervillains — and one superhero who happens to be married to one. The purpose of this Kickstarter campaign is to raise the funds to print the 9th graphic-novel adaptation of the strip in book form. If you love comics — or even if you haven't read 'em since you were a kid — you're going to love seeing that world through the distorted lens of Evil Inc. WAIT -- WHAT'S A \"GRAPHIC-NOVELIZATION\" OF A COMIC STRIP?! This is something that I think makes the Evil Inc books really special. Instead of the usual printed collection of comic strips, I take the individual panels of the strips and design comic-book-style pages. I add content and panels that haven't been seen before to smooth out the narrative and make it a cohesive story. Here... take a look... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is a fantastic, continuous reading experience with a rapid-fire sense of humor. SO, TELL ME ABOUT THIS VOLUME Artistically, this volume represents a period of time when I think I was starting to hit my stride as an illustrator. I'm really proud of the visual appeal of these pages. And the stories? The book is peppered with short standalone story arcs — like these moments between Captain Heroic and his son... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...and stories about Cap and Miss Match when they were a young couple... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus... longer storylines with driving plots like the heist of the Ruby of Ragnoor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the mystical Ruby winds up in Miss Match's hands, a mis-worded wish has unintended results! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, throughout the 112-page book, my dumb sense of humor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET TO THE REWARDS! I've got some tremendous ways to reward your generous support of this project! Beyond the book itself, there's previous volumes, tons of original art, special Artist Edition books (in which I do a special drawing in your book just for you), and more! \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Having done two previous Kickstarter campaigns, I have a realistic concept of how long it takes to print the book and then get it out to my supporters. I have adjusted my target dates accordingly, and I'm confident that this project will be delivered on smoothly. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Both Danish Broadcasting (DR), City of Copenhagen and Spies Travel Agency have been running grandiose campaigns like \"Sex for Denmark\" and \"Do it for Mum\" to urge young couples to have children much earlier instead of focusing only on their studies and careers. With \"Zombabies\" we use the horror genre to comment on the grotesque fixation of the great dilemma young people face when they want both children and careers. The movie above: Our poster with original music composed for the film. It will give you a feeling for the atmosphere of the film. Synopsis  Zombabies is a horror short film about trust and communication in relationships and about flesh eating zombie babies. A young couple are on a trip with friends. She thinks they have agreed to never have children. He has gradually changed his mind. On the almost deserted Ash Island his wish might come true in the most horrible way imaginable.  Director’s statement Director, Nikolaj Tarp: “Zombabies is a passion project for me and writer/actor Claus Reenberg. We love the horror genre, and this has to be a kick ass horror short, pulling no punches visually. But it has to be more than that. The story deals with the lack of communication between lovers and the life changing decisions we all have to make sooner or later. Zombabies will be fun, scary and hopefully thought provoking to some extent. I am committed to working with a talented crew and cast, who are all to various degrees strong creative contributors in the process of making this film. This will be a team effort, and I hope you will join Zombabies and help us by contributing to our campaign”.  \n\n\nThe Director- Nikolaj Tarp \n \n\n \n\n\nThe cast   The cast includes a well known name in Gordon Kennedy, famous for his work in the Danish comedy genre, now cast against type in a horror film. Other cast members are Simone Lykke (who can currently be seen in Danish theaters as the female lead of the feature film “Hundeliv”), Morten Hembo (“Steppeulv”, “1864”) and fresh new faces Claus Reenberg, Cecilie Thiim and Teit Samsøe. \n\n\nCast- Zombabies \n \n\n \n\n\nComposer Mathias Madsen Munch. I am looking so much forward to composing the score for the Zombabies Movie, which will be my first horror movie as a composer. Quite early in the process I suggested to director Nikolaj Tarp that one option would be to compose for a small musical ensemble based on electric violin, grand piano and a female voice – and fortunately he loved the idea. I strongly believe that arranging for this particular ensemble will allow me to find the right tone for the movie and I am especially thrilled to work with the talented violinist Jens Elfving, whose unique electric violin “Elvari” will color the score in many ways; from romantic, melancholic passages to creepy eerie sounds We need your help for this The 4000 kr., which we would love to achieve with this crowdfunding, will finance building the barn where the bloody main scene with the zombie babies will occur.\n \nThe barn will be build on a sound stage.. We want to build it so we can create the scary environment, where our main characters will stand face to face with a threat they didn’t even know existed. The funding will be used for special effects makeup, props and other cool stuff used in the film to make it kick ass horror! Actors and crew are working voluntarily on the film. We are ambitious and are focusing on developing talents and to get an even greater focus on the horror genre in Denmark.\n \nWe therefore hope that you would like to help us in succeeding with this project. What you get You are going to be a part of a kick ass horror film, you can get your name in the end credit, you can get an executive or associate producer title, DVD/BLU Ray, posters, VIP tickets and just the pleasure of supporting hard working but very lovable filmmakers. We love any support, and we THANK YOU.  Risks and challenges The film industry is very difficult, and getting your film unded (especially a horror film) has not been easy. In Denmark there is a very small horror film market. But our target audience is both Danish and international. \nWe have great connections on genre film festivals and we know that there is a bright dark future for this film.

    "textDescription": "Story White Elephant is producing pink milk  in Oracle B*Sides -a program designed to expand the offering of free art to the community in Public Access Theatre. The proposal was selected to participate in the B*Sides because of its high quality and compelling content. This production will be a unique experience for theater-goers from every walk of life, and it won't cost anyone anything to see it. Join us! Help us make free art for all! \nOpens Saturday, August 10, 2013  at 8PMThrough Saturday, September 7, 2013 . WHAT IS pink milk? pink milk is a drama infused with dance inspired by the life of Alan Turing, the British mathematician known for creating the Turing Machine - the precursor to our modern day computers.  Lonely, gay, Snow White obsessed Alan meets Christopher, a boy whose passion for piano is as deep as Alan's passion for pi. But as soon as he appears, Christopher is gone. As Alan grows older, he builds robots to replace his lost love, tries to find answers from a talking daisy, and gets lost in trysts with curious boys until the fateful day Alan meets the mysterious Arnold, whose poisoned apple causes Alan’s life to spiral out of control.  Through movement, poetry and electronic music, PINK MILK is an experience that intersects science and art by exploring a rich fantasy world while navigating complex themes from our present society. \n\npink milk was written as a reaction to the media's coverage of Tyler Clementi's suicide. “Frustrated by the fact that the media presented this suicide and the rest of the \"gay teen suicides\" as a new epidemic”, says playwright Alex Paul Young, “I wanted to explore the emotional truth of the life of Alan Turing, whose avant-garde approach to computer science was stunted by society's refusal to include his queer lifestyle into their world, resulting in Alan's 1954 suicide.” The play expands on this queer narrative to comment on our contemporary world where queer individuals are still hurting because society will not include them in its threads. \nHailed by Newcity Stage as one of the Top 5 New Plays of 2012 , Mr. Young wrote pink milk while pursuing his undergraduate degree at Northwestern University. After its initial premiere on campus by the student group Vertigo Productions, the play journeyed to FringeNYC and Chicago Fringe, where it saw sold-out performances and enthusiastic feedback. Presented by Oracle Productions in association with White Elephant a year after Alan’s centennial, pink milk  remains a moving, shocking and relevant portrayal of a life too often forgot. \nWHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT? \nAs a part of the Oracle B*Sides program, pink milk is presented to audiences for free in Public Access Theatre. \nOracle believes you can’t live without art, so we are devoted to making sure everyone everywhere has a chance to experience the arts. By offering our art to the community for free, we foster creativity and bolster people’s aspirations. We collaborate with other organizations to engage them in this mission. We are committed to spreading a love for art worldwide ­ and we want you to join us in our cause. Oracle is art for all. \nThis means that all costs associated with the production are to be fundraised separately, as there are no ticket sales to bolster the budget. Here are some specific examples of what that means \n\nrehearsals - room rentals \nbuilding the set - including custom-designed seating for our audience \nconstructing the costumes - with many instantly interchangeable characters, our costumes need to be sophisticated and dance-capable \nand much more \n \n\nA donation of any amount brings us closer to our goal, and is sincerely appreciated. Even sharing this Kickstarter with your friends or “liking” our page on Facebook is a huge help! \n- Thank you,the pink milk teamfacebook.com/pinkmilkplay \n\nWHO IS IN THE CAST? \n\n\n\nAaron Stephenson as Alan  \n\nCole Doman as Christopher \n\nCharlie Kolarich as Arnold/Mr. Turing \n\nDarren Barrere as The Experiments \n\nJessica Dean Turner as The Authority Figures \n\nCaitlin Collins as The Mothers \n\nCarrie Drapac as The Inanimate Objects \n\nCasey Hartley (u/s) \n\nAmelia Hefferon (u/s) \n\nScott Shimizu (u/s) \n\nJustin Leider (u/s) \n \n\nWHO IS ON THE TEAM? \n\n\n\nPlaywright:  Alex Paul Young \n\nDirector:  Brandon Powers \n\nExecutive Producer for Oracle Productions:  Ben Fuchsen \n\nDirector of Programming for Oracle Productions: David Boren \n\nWhite Elephant: Naomi Rosen, Breanne Ward, Abby Schwarz, Alex Paul Young\n \n\nProducers:  Rachel Birnbaum, Louis Schermerhorn\n \n\nAssistant Producers:  Dylan Pickus, Alex Wolfe\n \n\nProduction Manager:  Ford Altenbern\n \n\nStage Manager: Rachel Stubblefield-Tave\n \n\nGraphic Designer: Juli Del Prete\n \n\nVideographer: Nate Bartlett \n\nScenic & Props Designe r:  Emma Pardini \n\nLighting Designer:   Jessica Carson  \n\nCostume Designer: Cassandra Bowers \n\nAssociate Costume Designer:   Akilah Grant-Sullivan \n\nOriginal Music Composed by VISAGER \n \n \n\nWHAT IS ORACLE PRODUCTIONS? \n \nOracle is a Chicago based public arts company. We produce our own season as well as provide space and mentoring to burgeoning theatre companies. Most importantly, everyone at Oracle believes that art is necessary to live a full life. So, we work with great artists to create great art to share with as many citizens as possible. And we give it to them for free. \nOracle B*Sides is an arts service initiative devoted to giving artists the opportunity to produce their work in Public Access Theatre. Groups of artists submit project proposals for consideration. Once accepted, Oracle provides space, production and fundraising mentorship, and technical resources at no cost to the visiting artists – on one condition: the piece is offered to the community for free through Public Access Theatre. \nWHAT IS WHITE ELEPHANT PROJECT? \nWhite Elephant is a theatre collective that creates unlikely experiences in unexpected places. WE pulls theatre out of its cage, unleashes the liveness, and re-harnesses it for the environment of now.WE curates immersive experiences that break theatrical form to bring people together across disciplines and communities.WE creates adaptations, reinventions, parties, tours and voyages. Some look like plays, others don't.WE facilitates conversations, workshops, and celebrations with organizations and individuals that feed our art and their causes \n Risks and challenges FROM the WHITE ELEPHANT team:\n\nOne of our major challenges is designing an immersive and dance-friendly set in a compact space. In order to execute a scenic design that embraces the intimacy of the space while still providing a safe danceable area we are building custom audience seating and installing a dance floor.\n\nAnother challenge is creating costumes that are simultaneously period, poetic, timeless, and washable. This very physical show requires costumes to be breathable, moveable, and easily maintainable.\n\nOur final challenge is doing all of this without any reliance on ticket sale revenue. We need to maintain the quality of the production while keeping it free to the public! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

The\nproject brings voice and visibility to these Women as well as\ninspiration and the opportunity for people to become engaged citizens in\ntheir own communities. The Portraits represent the\nWomen themselves and a sense of the intensity, connection, strength and deep\nemotional space that it requires for them to do the resistance work they do. As for the printed\nGlobal Campaigns, there is something that happens when you put up a poster\nof one of these women in your Community or send a postcard of their work out into the world. What happens is that in a small but profoundly\nimportant way you have sent your voice, opinion, action out into the world to\nconnect with others.

    "textDescription": "Story GI JOBS PROJECT \"A Documentary Film on the Human Spirit\" THE GI JOBS PROJECT At Defensor  Security and Protection Services we have created the “GI JOBS SILVERLING PROJECT ” with the goal of creating a documentary film that will show the power of the human spirit when faced with life changing hurdles and diversities. This documentary is intended to show how veterans, not only physically sound veterans, but amputees, and wheel chair bound vets, can live a fulfilling life.  We'll document three veterans like the three types above from discharge to the job hunt and once they have landed a place at Defensor Security and Investigative Services they are pleased to find an industry ready to craft jobs around their infirmities.  The documentary will conclude at the end of three months employment and an update on the personal success they've experienced during this time.  This will serve as proof that a person with spirit and willing industries can adapt and overcome to succeed at whatever he or she wants too. It is no coincidence that veterans are the source of this documentary, they represent a large group of Americans returning from harsh and mentally trying experience.  These people have worked with pieces of equipment worth millions of dollars and many have sustained life altering injuries.  They represent a caliber of individual that boldly walked into danger at a young age, performed their duty, and now are honorably returning home. It is also no coincidence that Defensor Security and Protection Services Inc. was the example of a company and industry that would work with veterans and others.  The CFO of DSP, Sean Erickson comes from a family that traces military duty back seven decades from great grandpa to Sean.  His compassion for veterans and their causes has led him to commit $15,000 of his own money (to date) to see this documentary through to completion.  It is his goal to see the documentary presented at the Sundance or Caens film festivals.  Sean will present the finished documentary to the Discovery Channel and National Geographic Channel for airtime consideration. This documentary will not serve as an infomercial or a training guide, it is a true celluloid captured piece of three peoples lives for four to five months.  It will be an interest piece for families, friends, and veterans finding themselves in similar situations. Join with us,\npledge what you can and let’s see if “THE\nGI JOBS SILVERLINING PROJECT DOCUMENTARY” can\nmake a difference in at least some of these veteran’s lives.Thank you. Risks and challenges The risks are always a major factor in any project of this magnitude. The foremost risk would be the quality of the documentary. Let's face reality and realize that the quality, duration, and professionalism of the art is directly proportionately to the funds available. Therefore the more pledges we have the more we can do. A second hurdle that often comes when doing documentary work is the commitment of the participants; we have to choose our people well in the beginning. Thirdly would be; the amount of time it takes to complete the project can be very small compared to the time it takes to reach a public venue like; The Sundance or Caens Festivals or Broadcast and Cable Television. We are prepared to walk the whole path and want the people pledging money to stay the course with us. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story What\nis How To Build A Spaceship? \n\nHave you always wanted to build your own\nspaceship? Well, this is your chance! How To Build A Spaceship is a unique\nopportunity to take your own NASA-worthy pictures of our home, planet Earth.\nOkay, it’s not really a spaceship; it’s more like a near-spaceship: A weather\nballoon that will reach high up into the Stratosphere (around 30 to 40 km high\non an average budget). I myself had often read stories about people who had\nmanaged to send their balloon into near-space, had taken incredibly beautiful\npictures, or had even done measurements on the Stratosphere’s atmospheric\nconditions; the most incredible part of those stories: these people had managed\nto do all that with just a few hundred bucks! NASA/ESA quality results, for\na DIY price! \n\nThe question is: how did they do it? Information\non this specific topic is scarce, and even if it’s there, it’s never complete.\nMoreover, every web-page with tips and guides for such a project uses a\ndifferent approach, resulting in a pile of incomplete and conflicting\ninstructions. How To Build A Spaceship will be the first complete and clear\nbook to aid anyone with their near-space project. \n\n\nA Book! \n \n\n \n\n\n The book will not only be a\nguide to benefit those who are not physicists, electrical engineers, and\nprogrammers at the same time, but it will also include in-depth reasoning,\nequations, and my original calculations for those who would like to understand\nthe rationale behind the instructions, and customize their own contraption. \n\nIt’s both for people who want to do a cool\nDIY science project and don’t know how, and for people who just don’t have the\ntime to figure everything out themselves, but still want to build something\nlike this. Be it for educational purposes, or purely for fun, by linguists, or\nby engineers: How To Build A Spaceship will make a Stratosphere balloon\naccessible to anyone, but it will still teach everyone, even those who\nalready know quite a bit about near-space exploration. The\nworld’s first complete guide for DIY space exploration.   \n\nWhat\nwill the book look like? \n\nThe height your balloon will reach will\ndepend on the size of the balloon you choose: the bigger the balloon, the\nhigher your payload will go, but also the higher your cost. You will need to\nset your goals first: what’s your budget and what can you achieve with it? Then\nyou will go through all the steps, from how to build your GPS, to the best\ndesign of the probe-box. Each step will start straight to the point with what\nyou need, where to get it, and most importantly: How to do it, from how to code a\nhomemade GPS, to how to tie the balloon to the payload box. If you want to read in-depth reasoning, please do! If you don't, no problem, then simply skip these sections. In short: complete, extensive, accurate, and fun! \n\nNow\nhow will it work? \n\nThis is the fun part! Your “spaceship” will\nconsist of 3 main elements: \n\n     - the Balloon \n\n     - the Payload box \n\n     - the Parachute \n\n\nSpaceship's rough layout \n \n\n \n\n\nThe\nballoon: \n\nThe balloon will provide all the lift, and\nwill carry the payload to a desired altitude. It only has this one function.\nSounds quite simple, but there’s more to it: When you fill your balloon before\nlaunch, you cannot just fill it until it feels right: it is necessary that you\nknow exactly how much Helium to pump into it. It has to be filled partially, just\nthe right amount, so that the balloon will fly with a certain minimum lift force. Then, on its\njourney upwards, air pressure and temperature will drop, which causes the\nballoon to expand. \n\n\nExpansion! \n \n\n \n\n\nAt a certain height, the balloon will not be able to expand\nmore, so it will pop, and fall back to earth. Therefore, the height your\nspaceship will reach largely depends on the balloon you buy and what volume of\ngas you initially put into it. \n\n\nPOP! \n \n\n \n\n\nThe\npayload box: \n\nThis is the actual “spaceship”. The payload\nbox will contain all the electronic equipment, including the cameras or\nmeasuring equipment you want to launch. The box needs to be light and capable of\nwithstanding the landing shock and the extreme conditions of near-space. It will\ncontain a GPS relay system for you to know the whereabouts of your near-spaceship\nat all times, since the spaceship will get carried away by the wind. \n\n\nTracking! \n \n\n \n\n\nEspecially\nthe GPS system seems to be a struggle for most people: Do I need a radio\ntransmitter? Will a regular GPS work at near-space altitudes? Expect an\nextensive explanation on multiple methods to track your payload, all with their\nrespective pros and cons. \n\nThe parachute: \n\nPositioned between the payload box and the\nballoon, the parachute has its obvious function: to make sure everything\nlands back on earth, in one piece. It does not need a fancy deploying mechanism, since\nair density at high altitudes is so low, that drag forces will not be large\nenough to open the parachute until it reaches a certain altitude. \n\nSounds\nfun, let’s do it! \n\nIt doesn't just sound fun and informative,\nit is a great experience! The theory seems relatively easy, but in reality it\ncan get quite complex. Many factors have to be taken into account, and you will\nneed lots of exact information, not just a rough notion of how it works. How To Build\nA Spaceship will provide all the information you could possibly need, even information on flight path predictions for both altitudes and location. In the\nend, but one question remains: Do you want to know how to build a spaceship?! Risks and challenges Investing in a project made by a high-school senior may seem risky, yet it is actually not that much of a gamble. How To Build A Spaceship started as a school project, essentially it still is, but not just any school project: It makes up 33% of one of my graduation grades. Therefore, this project is quite important to me, so you can rest assured: It will get done! Moreover, I will most likely graduate cum laude, I have participated in more science Olympiads than I can count, and I am a member of numerous academic talent networks, so I hope you trust in my capabilities. \n\nThen again, I am no engineer, university graduate, or whatever, so the challenges I will face will be harder to overcome for me. Real challenges, just how I like it. However, I have my teachers by my side to help me if I can’t figure something out. I have already had contact with printing companies, and I have done a lot of research on the topic, so I expect to finish the book in April this year. Also, I will launch my own near-spaceship before fulfilling the rewards, therefore any inaccuracies or mistakes in the book will be filtered out before shipment.

    "textDescription": "Story What is this about? \nThis is a hybrid tabletop game with an adaptive storyline, in a Role Playing format. Every time you play, the storyline and outcome is different. There will be built in choices in the full version. You choose an adventure starting point, and the game takes you down a different path based on chance and decisions. It involves using the Stickmen to fight monsters along the way in order to win. \nFree trial of this game is available for backers during this campaign. Simply drop me a message and I can send it via email. \nMinimum setup: \n70 cards, which consists of \n\n 5 hero cards \n 35 equipment cards \n 5 adventure cards \n 25 item cards \n \nYou will also need to print and cut 32 heart shapes to keep track of the HP of every hero (You will have to do this yourself for now, this will be available once the campaign is successful). \n\n\n\n\n4 types of cards, total 70 cards \n \n\n \n\n\nThere are 5 heroes in this game, which are the Paladin, Tank, Mage, Archer and Healer. \n\n\n\n\n5 Hero cards \n \n\n \n\n\nHow to play: \n\n Download and print the 70 cards \n Scan the adventure card you want to start with, using a mobile phone \n Follow instructions and play \n \nWatch the campaign video for an example of the gameplay. Took around 30 minutes to play a single campaign (2 players, 1 \"NPC/extra hero\"). \nScroll down if you want to know the details about the gameplay. Or just support the campaign, and play right away by following the instructions. \nAdditional Items (Optional): \n\n 3D printed models of the 5 heroes, able to pose for the camera \n 3D printed hearts (print 32), easier to use than paper ones \n \n\n\n\n\n3D printed Stickmen posing for the camera with the 3D printed hearts \n \n\n \n\n\nStory within the game and game pathways: \nThe story will vary over time, as I will change the storyline even after this campaign is successful, depending on the amount of time I have (Everyone needs money to eat, and Singapore is more expensive than many other places in this world). For now, the story is somewhere along the lines of Stickmen coming together, transforming into the 5 heroes, and fighting Covid-19. In future it may be some kind of fantasy story involving rainbows and unicorns, depending on the kind of fans I attract (no extra payment required). The more I am paid to do this, the more I can do for players, and this design model allows some form of subsidy to help me create the game content. More players = more content. \nHere is an illustration of the game path. The full game that comes with a successful campaign will have at least 5 options at every layer, and a minimum of 5 layers in the story. This produces 3125 possible stories. The free trial version has only 2 story pathways. \n\n\n\n\nExample of story pathways. Full version will have at least 3125 possible stories. \n \n\n \n\n\nShould I include a stretch goal? I don't know yet. Do tell. Here is a picture to show how the heroes can lose to Covid-19. The ones who have read through this campaign description will probably notice that this model is not included (see the 2 pictures below). \n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when you lose \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOh no! Covid-19 got the Healer! Paladin is pinned onto the ground! \n \n\n \n\n\nOther applications: \nYou can also use the 3D printed Stickmen to create comics like the one below. \n\n\n\n\nExample of Fighting Comic using 3D Printed Stickmen \n \n\n \n\n\nYou can also take pictures of Stickmen in various costumes and poses, and create fighting games in Scratch, as shown below, where I used my own saxophone to play the background music. \n\n \n\n \n\n Or you can use oil based markers or acrylic paint to make the figures more vibrant. \n\n\n\n\nPaladin with colour, created using oil based markers. \n \n\n \n\n\nHere are the more detailed steps to play the game: \nStep 1: Start off with the 4 decks of cards (Hero, Equipment, Adventure, Item) as shown in the photo: \n\n\n\n\nStart the game like this \n \n\n \n\nStep 2: Choose a random adventure card. It will have a QR code that looks something like this \n\n\n\n\nScan using phone to go to the start of the adventure! This link brings you back to my campaign page. \n \n\n \n \nStep 3: Read the start of the story, and follow instructions to choose a hero. You are allowed to add additional heroes as NPCs (additional helpers). To win, I advise that you use a balanced team of at least 3 heroes. You can play alone with additional 2 heroes. \n\n\n\n\nAt the start of the game, two of us used Paladin and Archer with Healer as NPC to support the team \n \n\n \n\n\nAs you can see, each hero gets 5 equipment cards at the start of the game. Some are unique to individual heroes, while others are generic. Extra slot card counts as 1 card as well. By default each hero can carry only 5 cards. Each additional slot card allows one more card for the respective hero. \nStep 4: When the initial setup is ready, read the story and follow the links to the next part of the game. Sometimes it will take you to a random encounter, where you have to fight a random monster. \n\n\n\n\nExample monster to fight - the hoarder. The reason some of you cannot find toilet paper. \n \n\n \n\nOn the random encounter page, you will get to throw a dice to fight the monster. It has an internal engine that calculates damage dealt and taken, based on the stats of heroes and monsters. The more times you throw, the more likely you can kill a monster with one of the heroes. By default each hero can only throw once. The extra throw card gives you an additional chance to throw. \nThe page will tell you if you have accumulated enough points to kill the monster. There are random boosts to stats based on the dice number. For example, if you throw a one, the healer, if wearing the angelic vest, can heal anyone on the team for 1 HP. Use the equipment boosts and hero stats to count the number of hearts each hero has. \nDamage taken is AoE (area of effect). That means all heroes without enough defense will lose a heart for every dice throw. This is automatically calculated to save you time. \nIf a hero has no hearts left, he/she is dead. If any of the heroes has a revive card, that hero can be revived, and given full HP based on equipment and stats. \nStep 5: Once you have defeated the monster, draw a random item card for each hero. Click on the link to continue the story, based on whether you managed to kill the monster. For example, if you have only 3 throws allowed, and you did not kill the monster after 3 throws, you go to a story link that tells you something sad. If you do win, sometimes, the item cards can make you lose some of your equipment. \n\n\n\n\nWhat the heroes have after a few random encounters. For example, the Healer lost his hula hoop, so all the equipment items that are meant for healer fail. \n \n\n \n\nFor example, if the archer loses his thinking cap, all his attacks fail. So even with a massive amount of attack stats, you cannot beat a monster with an archer. \nStep 6: Keep playing until the end of the story. There are 3125 possibilities in the full version, which should keep you busy for a while until I get enough time to change the storyline with a new set. No additional costs involved. Pay 5 Singapore Dollars and I will allow you to play until someone shuts down that website. \nWhy do this? \nJust to have fun with my family. I'm sharing this with the rest of the world, for those who are stuck at home due to lockdown, quarantine etc. You can print it on A4 paper and cut out (depending on printer), or use card stock (easier to create). Got bored staying in all day on most days due to LOCKDOWN in Singapore.  \nThe Plan: \nHere is what I have planned for you. I will use as much of my free time as possible to create the game content once the project is supported. The more money I can raise, the easier it is to tell my family that I can do this late at night while everyone is sleeping. This is after all a hobby to me. It will take about a month after the campaign to create the game content. Involves a lot of work writing, testing, and ensuring that the stories make sense, and the gameplay is hard enough for you. I have also created a way to subsidise all supporters, once the player number reaches a certain point. \nHow to support: \n\n For 5 Singapore dollars, you get the design for 70 cards to play this game and heart design for cutting out (sent via email) \n For 10 Singapore dollars, you get the STL files of 5 Stickmen heroes with accessories, as well as the STL file of the heart \n For 15 Singapore dollars, you get both.  \n \nWhy support me: \n\n If you believe that people who work hard to create fun games for you should be encouraged \n If you have spare cash to spare \n If you want more game content for free after this campaign \n If you want a cheap tabletop game \n If you want 3D printed Stickmen for projects or just for fun \n Risks and challenges I may not have enough time to create the game content in less than a month, because my family needs money to eat. The more funds I can raise, the more I can allocate time to create the game content.\n\nMost of the work is done after midnight (Singapore time), which allows me to sleep around 3 to 4 hours a day, on top of earning an income, being a parent, recording and mixing music etc.\n\nAs it does not involve production lines and worldwide logistics, the only risk is not having an internet connection to send the designs to you. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Environmental commitments Visit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices. Something else Backers print what they need. I don't have to print 1000 copies of this game for fewer than 1000 backers.\n\nBackers print the 3D models as and when they need to. Say goodbye to large scale production and massive waste generation.\n\nThere is a significant subsidy to support the game development once I get enough players. The more you play, the more content I can create after this campaign, at no additional cost. Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story I am raising money to complete a hauntingly beautiful photo book about life along the northern borders of Mexico's drug war. I will be using kickstarter generated funds to pay for an editor, book designer and most importantly a publishing company. The state of the book publishing industry these days generally requires the artist to bring substantial funds to the table to offset costs that book publishers simply cant cover anymore. Its like medical care, I need to bring a hefty co-pay to get results.  Reckoning at the Frontier is a photographic window into Mexico’s struggle with organized crime along its border with the United States. Centered around two cities, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Reckoning takes the viewer through the harsh deserts and urban mazes of northern Mexico on both a literal and interpretive photographic journey. \n\nI began photographing along the US Mexico border in June of 2005. Over the next five years, I made over a dozen trips to northern Mexico, each fueled by an evolving sense of thematic interpretation and historical perspective. I grew with the work as the border’s modern history unfolded before me. In 2010, I moved to the outskirts of Tijuana, where I live today. \n\n Seven years ago when I began, my agenda was vague. I wandered through the arid Tijuana hills photographing anything that caught my interest. A group of immigrants waiting to cross into the US, young children playing along the border fence, or an echelon of police motorcycles at a memorial service for slain officers. At that time, I had no idea that this project would be so strongly shaped by the modern Narco-wars that have been unfolding for years. I merely wanted to represent what life on the border looked and felt like. But it was impossible not to be drawn into the fray of organized crime; a phenomenon that is almost entirely misunderstood from a historical, economic and political perspective.  \n\nPart journalistic reportage and part conceptual interpretation, Reckoning looks beyond the body counts and media misinformation to reveal a country at war with it’s own ghosts. \n\nThematically, I am most intrigued by the notion that the wild western frontier has changed very little from the days of Pancho Villa and the Mexican revolution. Outlaws and dirty cops still control vast swaths of Mexican territory. Powerful four-wheel drive trucks have replaced horses, and lever-action rifles have been exchanged for fully automatic assault weapons. The government and its enforcers are still murderously corrupt, and the divide between rich and poor is still ultimately negotiated from behind the barrel of a gun.  \n\nI approached the subject with a cinematic eye rather than a strictly journalistic documentary style. I used a deliberately bleak color palette to accentuate the true feeling of the unforgiving desert. The terrain and the weather play into the narrative, the desert itself becomes a character. \n\n From the beginning of this project, I have always seen it as a book that would bring artistic sensibility to a subject matter that typically turns audiences away. I hope to give viewers greater perspective of a land and people that are so often vilified with extreme prejudice due to political agendas and basic misunderstanding. I was inspired to realize this project not only by previous works of journalism, but also by great works of fiction. I hope to pass on and build upon this inspiration so that others might seek out their own understanding of this pivotal point in Mexico’s history.\n The Reckoning team includes picture editor Jasmine DeFoore, book designer Maggie Fost, social media director Erin Siegal, and writer Myles Estey. This Kickstarter campaign will raise money to help pay for the printing costs of the book. The reality of today's book publishing industry demands that the artist contribute substantial money towards printing and distribution. The photography is done, I have the material. Now comes the hard part, and I need your help! Risks and challenges Most of the risks have already been taken: Me slinking around the killing floor of the Mexican narco-war for several years. I'm still alive, and I've kept my Mexican contacts safe. I now want something to show for the many years and sacrifices I have invested into this project. The only risk now is me losing money on the publishing end, but I just ordered a money tree from Amazon and it should be growing cash in the next ten years.

    "textDescription": "Story It's been two and half years since Adam Weiss, Jason Desiderio and Matt Schaefer gathered near the frozen winter shores of Lake Erie to record the first antics album, Everything.  It was a school project that turned into something much bigger, but it was recorded, mixed and mastered on a school project budget, $0. It's available to stream and download (for free) at www.everythingantics.com . Flash forward to summer 2012. antics , now including Ian Carroll and David Saracino, live in the heart of Brooklyn, where they've been working on new material for over two years. With hundreds of hours spent writing, practicing, playing shows, recording demos and re-writing new songs, they're ripe to record their second LP. Fortunately, antics have graduated beyond a school project. To realize the potential of their new material, they'll need a budget to work with talented engineers and use professional equipment, which is the purpose of this Kickstarter. A little support from people like you will make all the difference.  And in return, you'll get sweet rewards and the chance to say you supported antics from the beginning.  For those of you who don't know what's ahead for antics, here's a rundown of their game plan: Step 1: Tracking the Album - During the tracking process, band members record their parts to each song in a recording studio.  First, all the drum tracks are recorded. Then, while listening to the drums, the next instrument is recorded. This process continues until all the layers of instruments fit nicely together. antics will be tracking in a full scale recording studio and will bring in expert recording engineers. It'll likely take two months or more to record all the tracks. Step 2: Mixing the Album -  Once an album is tracked, the sounds are good individually, but they need help blending together within each song.  antics will take their tracks to a professional studio in Brooklyn where an engineer will work with a beautiful mixing board (and magic) to perfect each song. This will likely take another month. Step 3: Mastering the Album -  At this point, the songs sound good individually, but they don't quite feel like a complete collection, and they might sound better on a home speaker system as opposed to a pair of headphones.  antics will send the mixed songs to a mastering studio, where a mastering fairy will use the secrets of his/her trade (seriously, nobody knows how it's done) to make the album sound great as a complete collection, no matter where it's played.  Who knows how long this will take? Once the album is mastered, antics will send the final versions to be copied to CD and pressed to vinyl.  A single or two will be chosen to turn into music videos (as you can see, they know talented cameramen and video editors).  They'll also make stickers and t-shirts, which, contrary to popular belief, you can wear to the show they play at a venue near you.  That's right, wear the stickers too. It's going to be an exciting six months in Brooklyn. antics would love to have you along for the ride. Thanks!

    "textDescription": "Story Rodell Warner is an exciting artist from Trinidad who uses new media art to engage populist ideas.  Rodell will use his residency at New Local Space (NLS) in Kingston, Jamaica to carry out a community photography, fashion and object design project. From images captured in nature  he'll produce patterns and printed fabrics. Designers and other artists from Kingston have been invited to help create wearable garments and art objects from these fabrics and patterns, which will be shared publicly in a multimedia live event with a mixture of functional, material and digital art.  \n\n\nPattern made from photographs of nature and printed on fabric by Rodell Warner \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\"Dusty's Wig\" Digital patterns from photographs of nature by Rodell Warner \n \n\n \nThe first two weeks of his residency will be used to collect images, create patterns, meet with the designers and makers, upload images and order fabrics. The next five weeks\nwill be used to work with designers on garments and objects, develop animation of patterns and other play with the images as well as making\nand promoting the event. An exhibition will be mounted for the final two weeks of the residency. The $3400 being raised will help facilitate Rodell's purchasing of materials and services for the project (such as fabric, and printing of fabric) and cover Rodell's travel expenses and sleeping accommodations for the nine weeks of his residency. His recent work was selected to open ARC Magazine's New Media programming for the 2013 Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival. He has exhibited regionally and internationally at spaces such as Alice Yard and Medulla Gallery in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, CAG(e) Gallery, Edna Manley College in Kingston, Jamaica, and NIROX Projects in Johannesburg, South Africa. His work was also featured in “Pictures from Paradise: A Survey of Contemporary Caribbean Photography” (Robert and Christopher), 2012. New Local Space Ltd is a visual art initiative and micro-gallery in Kingston Jamaica that facilitates experimentation and collaboration in visual art, connects artists to each other locally and internationally, and presents their work to the larger public, building wider audiences for their work. NLS is a subsidiary of audio production house Creative Sounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges Risks:\nRodell's project will rely on overseas shipment of printed fabric and, like all shipping logistics, are subject to delay with severe weather. Due to this NLS will allow up to a 2 week extension on Rodell's residency if necessary.\n\nChallenges:\nFinding willing and able designers and artisans to collaborate with Rodell was a potential challenge of his project, however Rodell has drawn on his existing relationships with qualified individuals working in these fields locally.

This will be BSI's first vinyl release after 25 years of cassette and CDR releases, so I'm insisting on the best presentation: heavyweight virgin vinyl manufacturing, expert mastering, and beautiful package design. \nFor the music, I'll be joined by drummer Michael Shanahan, who also appears in the last release (Flight of the Solstice Queens), guitarist Jeff Barsky (aka Insect Factory), and master percussionist Jason Mullinax (aka Pilesar). It's still being recorded, but the chemistry is magical and the result promises to be an outrageously satisfying blast of head music. \nBUT HERE'S THE RUB: We need your help to finance the project. I'm a lifelong record-collector junkie and \"Negative Space\" is an attempt to give back a little to the world of vinyl. \nSo, at the very least, use Kickstarter to pre-order your copy of the album and get your name in the credits. But also consider a higher level of support ... Christ, baby, look at all that SWAG! Posters, limited CDs of album remixes, private-release DVDs, signed test-pressings, and ultimate whatnot! \nTHE POINT IS: The album won't be done without your help. So please support this example of truly independent and highly charged music. \nThe good folks at Furnace MFG will be handling the pressing & manufacturing, and judging by the quality we've seen from them (Mastodon releases, etc), we're expecting great things... \nNOTE: After release, the album will not be distributed digitally but those who pledge here WILL receive digital files in FLAC and MP3 format in addition to the vinyl.

    "textDescription": "Story  Les Délices has\nbeen earning a reputation for innovative programming and for its adaptions of\nneglected masterpieces to their own own performing forces through a combination of research, improvisation, and composition in historical styles. \n\nOur CD program “Myths & Allegories” will include\nthe world-premiere recording of Thomas-Louis Bourgeois’ Les Sirènes, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre’s dramatic cantata Le Sommeil d’Ulisse (in a new\narrangement by me), plus selections from Jean-Féry Rebel’s 1703 opera, Ulysse. Ulysses’ long-faithful wife\nPenelope pines from afar as symbolized by Rebel’s violin sonata La Fidelle , while Michel Pignolet de\nMontéclair’s La Guerre imagines\nUlysses and his men on the battlefield of the Trojan War. Artists include Clara Rottsolk (soprano), Debra Nagy (baroque oboe & recorder), Julie Andrijeski (violin), Emily Walhout (viola da gamba), and Michael Sponseller (harpsichord). We'll record at Harkness Chapel in Cleveland, OH from March 12-14 with the same engineer who created the sound for our debut CD, Peter Nothnagle. Editing will happen through the summer. We anticipate releasing the disc in early November, 2012. Scholars\nbelieve that Homer’s epic was a song sung to a rapt audience before it was ever\nwritten down, so it’s fitting that Les Délices returns this story to music with\nFrench baroque re-tellings of The\nOdyssey. The\nOdyssey ’s central theme – and the source of its\nuniversal appeal - is the enduring strength of love, hope, and fidelity, and\ntheir ability to withstand tests of time and tribulation. With Myths & Allegories,\nwe glimpse Ulysses and his troops in the midst of the Trojan war, and witness\ntheir battling storms at sea, shipwreck, the tantalizing allure of siren songs,\nand magical slumber – all set to music. Eventually, Ulysses overcomes many\nobstacles to be reunited with his faithful wife Penelope. \n\nLes Délices first performed “Myths & Allegories”\non our concert series in May 2011. Critics had an overwhelmingly positive\nresponse to this program. Cleveland’s Plain Dealer lauded Les Délices’ “refined\nenergy” and “elegant prowess,” adding that the “marvelous young soprano Clara Rottsolk\nshould soon be a star in the early music world.” ClevelandClassical.com felt\nthis program was “as close to perfection as a concert can come.” \n\nLes\nDélices was founded in Cleveland in 2006, and brings together artists with\nnational reputations who share a passion for this exquisite yet seldom heard\nrepertoire. In 2009, with the help of a small group of private donors, Les Délices\nreleased their debut CD, The Tastes Reunited. NPR’s Harmonia singled out Les Délices\nfirst release among the “Top Ten Early Music Discoveries of 2009.” Since then,\nLes Délices has been delighting audiences with their own self-produced concert\nseason in Cleveland, and with touring performances on prestigious series such\nas New York City’s Frick Collection and Music Before 1800.

Deceptively simple and highly interactive, 3 Seeds takes only 3 minutes to teach (see the overview below), but offers a gaming experience that's tough to master.  Each player has a secret harvest card, a crop card, and a hand full of three types of seeds: Time, Money, & Labor. Sow the seeds to complete crops (yours or your opponent's), multiply by the secret harvest values, and reap points. Mix in special event cards, harvest card swapping, and end game bonuses for crop sets, and the result is a tight mix of short-term and long-term strategic choices.  3 Seeds is Chara Games' second title. We successfully funded Commissioned  last year, and delivered it to backers early! 3 Seeds is our first time working with an outside designer. Anthony & Holli Buhr are new designers, but they have invested 3 years designing 3 Seeds. Their passion  and persistence is evident in the gameplay, and we are excited to bring the fruit of their labor to a wider audience! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny given turn is simple. Draw up to 3 seed cards from your deck. Choose to either look at any 1 harvest card, or swap two harvest cards without looking. Play 2 seeds on any crop(s). Play event cards if you desire. Score completed crops. Pass the turn marker. As you will see in the videos below, however, it's knowing where and when to play those seed and event cards that gives 3 Seeds its surprisingly strategic and interactive fun! Rules Overview Video \n\n\nFull Game (47 mins with 3 new players) \n\n\nLINK TO DOWNLOADABLE RULEBOOK \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigner, Anthony Buhr, is grateful for the help 3 Seeds received during testing at both the Protospiels in Milwaukee and Madison. Thanks to all the testers and organizers who helped improve this game!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Every Box of 3 Seeds Includes: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed, crop, harvest, & event cards will be poker-sized, 300 GSM, and linen finished. The Scorecard will be 3.5\" by 5.5\", 300 GSM, and linen finish.

There is a decent amount of strategy and if one player isn't paying attention, scores can quickly become lopsided. I found 3 Seeds to be thoroughly enjoyable and all players at the table wanted to play it again after we finished our first game.\" Stephen Hall from Anti-Monopoly - Full Review \"I enjoy 3 Seeds. It is a very nice, accessible game. The length feels just right for a game of its weight. There is enough strategy to make players feel like their decisions matter, but not enough that it becomes brain-burning...The strategy is simple, but there is enough of it that it can be enjoyed by players of varying skill levels. Because of its simplicity, 3 Seeds would work well with families.\" Megan Schauf - Playtester \"LOVE this game. It is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I love how you can change things every game. It has never played the same way. Especially when it's played with different people! You can use different techniques as you learn and grow in the game. Some games are very repetitious and this is not one of them. I have also heard many friends say \"I hate games\" LOVE this game and want to play more! Only advice I have for anyone wondering what to do is... BUY IT!\" Kevin Delp from Kickstarter Conniption - Video Review \"3 Seeds is a great game that teaches simple truths. The decisions are fun as I manage my limited resources in this game!\" \n\n\nFather Geek - Full Review \"Child and Parent Geek Approved!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All stretch goals achieved in this campaign will be included in every retail copy of 3 Seeds. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select this add on, use the \"Combine\" pledge level. The extra cost is $32 in the US. Additional shipping fees apply outside the US. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink to the Commissioned Kickstarter Page Link to the Commissioned BoardGameGeek Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing  We are slated to work with Quality Playing Cards and Games out of Orlando, FL for this project. We worked with them for Commissioned, and the results were outstanding! Depending on where you live, this is how we plan to fulfill your pledge: US Backers: The games will be shipped from the factory direct to Amazon. Amazon will individually package and ship your copy to the address you provide us. Canadian Backers: The games will be shipped to the Snakes & Lattes warehouse in Buffalo, NY. From there, they will be imported into Canada, packaged, and shipped to the address you provide us. All Other Backers: The games will be shipped from the factory directly to Ideaspatcher in France. We will pay the VAT (through Ideaspatcher) so that EU backers do not have to. The games are then repacked for individual shipments around the world. We used the same plan to fulfill our Commissioned Kickstarter, and were able to deliver to backers more than a month before our expected delivery date. We are sure there will be bumps in the road, but we will keep you informed every step of the way! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany backers have legitimate questions about shipping costs. The table below lays out what our shipping costs are (based on the fulfillment plans outlined above), and what you can expect to pay in shipping costs based on what you pledge. We have no desire to \"profit\" on shipping. This is simply the reality of moving games across oceans and continents in today's economy. Actually, international shipping will likely exceed these estimates. But Kickstarter is our only opportunity to ship outside the US and Canada, so we want to make it as approachable as possible to backers around the world. If you are interested in more than two copies of 3 Seeds, see the FAQ below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Can I back for multiple copies of 3 Seeds? Yes! There are three ways to do this: A) If you want 2 copies, use the \"Cultivator\" level.  B) If you want more than two copies, select the \"Cultivator\" or \"Combine\" levels and increase the pledge amount. For the US/Canada/other countries, add $11/ $13/$15 respectively for each additional game. This would make the total pledge amounts for three copies of 3 Seeds: $40 (US), $49 (Canada), and $59 (Other Countries). C) If you are a US retailer, consider the \"Broadcast Seeder\" level. 2. Will the stretch goals be included in retail versions of 3 Seeds? Yes! The Kickstarter campaign enables us to include all the stretch goals in every copy of 3 Seeds. 3. Can I get multiple copies of Commissioned? Yes! Contact us directly to work out a custom-tailored package based on your desired number of games and location! 4. Can I connect with you on Facebook? Absolutely! Our page is: https://www.facebook.com/CharaGames/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChara Games Thanks: We want to thank the amazing gaming community for the support and assistance we received over the last year with our first game, Commissioned. That success has enabled the development of this campaign. Also, thank you to Anthony & Holli Buhr for sharing their design with us, graciously working with us to make adjustments where required, and generally being awesome to work with! For more information about us, our company, or Commissioned, please visit: www.charagames.com Anthony Buhr Thanks: I want to thank my wife for providing a huge amount of support throughout the three years of developing the game and providing her graphic design skills which give the game a unique look. Also, thank you to all my friends and family who provided encouragement and great feedback that helped make the game what it is today; I couldn't have done it without you! A huge thank you to Chara games for picking up my game and being great to work with through the whole process. Lastly, thank you to all the backers of this campaign. Your support will get 3 Seeds to the tables of families and friends all over the world! Thanks again! Risks and challenges Every tabletop game on Kickstarter encounters some kind of unexpected event during the printing and fulfillment process. Frequently, this translates into delays. We expect the unexpected to happen with 3 Seeds, and have built this into our timeline. Here is our promise to our backers:\n\n1) Proper Preparation\n\nArt and play testing for this game are complete. Every stretch goal has been thoroughly planned. We remain open to improving language in the rulebook, but a cohesive rulebook is in place. We know there is a lot of competition for your support. Our goal is to show you that this campaign is prepared to do exactly what it says it will do.\n\n2) Clear, Consistent, Transparent Communication\n\nWe invite you to ask our backers from the Commissioned campaign last year about our attempts to keep everyone fully informed on the process. Practically, this means we will send monthly updates plus updates at key events (art accepted by manufacturer, press proof received, advanced copies shipping, main shipment status, backer shipments, etc). \n\nAt any time during this campaign or fulfillment process, please do not hesitate to send us your questions, comments, and feedback. We can only improve our process when we know something is not working the way it should. Thank you in advance for your patience and trust!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nPat & Kat Lysaght\nChara Games Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Now that the campaign is over, you can join us at www.SacredOrdinaryDays.com  and www.JennGilesKemper.com  for ongoing conversations about leading a life of deep faith and meaningful service. What happens there will expand on what we've shared here. There we'll invite you to go deeper through writing, videos, one-on-one work, retreats, workshops and other opportunities to learn and practice together online and in real life. We also plan to offer these planners on a yearly basis for a long time to come. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've reached our stretch goal! Through a stretch goal  we were able to work together to bring two features to the planners that weren't possible before we reached $80,000. You can see all of the details on the stretch goal in Update #2 . Now that we've crossed $80,000, all planners will include a satin ribbon bookmark and backers whose reward level included a planner or planners will be able to choose whether they want a green or grey cover in a post-campaign survey. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSacred Ordinary Days is the culmination of years of learning, listening, teaching, and walking alongside people who were hungry for peace, presence and purpose. My work as a Spiritual Director and a consultant for fellow entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders is focused on helping people discern and do the work that they were uniquely called and created to do. It's based on my belief that the church is most fully the church when every person is fully him- or herself. My heart is to help people do their own work effectively, joyfully, and sustainably - no matter what their \"work\" is.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSacred Ordinary Days is a Liturgical day planner that combines a number of transformational tools, which have aided the spiritual journey of many Christians, including mine. Inside you will find resources and reflections for the beginner and the master alike on...  \n\nthe Lectionary (we draw from the Revised Common Lectionary)  \nthe Seasons and Holy Days of the Liturgical Calendar, also called the Christian Calendar or the Church Calendar  \nthe Daily Office texts found in the Book of Common Prayer   \nthe practice of crafting a “Rule of Life”  \na Liturgical Wheel Calendar, redesigned to be elegantly simple and clear  \na Prayer Labyrinth to “walk” with your finger instead of your feet, also called a Finger Labyrinth \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with these time-tested tools for spiritual formation, our planner also incorporates layouts designed for productivity and focus. There are... \n\nthree daily projects to focus your attention, with space to notate cues and rests or rewards for yourself. This allows you to recognize what each project’s catalyst or bottleneck is, as well as noticing what drains and refills your energy throughout each day, keeping you from burnout.  \na section for at-a-glance notes, journaling, or your to-do list  \na section for your daily schedule  \nsome intentional white space at the bottom of each page  \nDuring the campaign, you can get a free sample download of October to try for yourself at ww.SacredOrdinaryDays.com . Afterward, we'll offer you another way to dip you toe in for free. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be able to draw inspiration by viewing examples of how other people are using the flexible layouts, depending on their preferences and stage of life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe chose Smyth-sewn binding after much research, testing and deliberation. With this binding style, the pages open and lay flat, for ease and comfort while writing. Plus, it slips into bags and blends into bookshelves the way a durable, beautiful book ought to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach week starts with a weekly plan page on the left and Sunday on the right. The weekly plan page includes the Liturgical Season or Holy Day, a prayer or quote, the weekly Lectionary texts, and space to reflect on the previous week and reset for the coming week. We invite you to look deeply at six areas of your life – spirit, body, mind, relationships, home, and work. Sunday’s page has the Liturgical Season or Holy Day, a prayer, the Daily Office texts, a quote on Sabbath, and space for journaling, sermon notes, scheduling, or whatever needs working out in your own life.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe daily pages also follow a rhythm. They are paired Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Friday and Saturday, each with the same design. This daily page design includes the Liturgical Season or Holy Day, a prayer, the Daily Office, daily projects, journal space, and schedule space. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe planner will be a faithful guide and companion through all of the seasons in the liturgical year. We'll walk with you through Advent, Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, Easter, and Pentecost. At the beginning of each season there are four pages that include seasonal art, resources (symbols, decorations, articles, book references, etc.), plus space to envision how you'd like to embody this season in the six areas of your life and then reflect and reset for how you'd like to embody the season next time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the front cover you'll see our simplified and clarified version of the Liturgical Wheel Calendar. From the outside rings inward are the months, Liturgical Seasons, and Holy Days. This should help you clearly visualize how the church calendar fits with your own calendar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The back inside cover features a Prayer Labyrinth paired with instructions on how and why to use it. This is a great tool for coming back to center throughout the day, which is why we wanted to include it in the planner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you know about the heart and vision of the planner, take a look at the rewards we've created to complement it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Sacred Ordinary Days Essentials Workbook PDF will be emailed to you. It features the most essential parts of the planner, including resources for each Liturgical season, 2016 monthly layouts, and a blank week layout for you to fill in, as well as the \"Rule of Life\" section for the beginning and the end of 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese letterpress prints measure 12” x 12” and will be hand printed on 220 lb. 100% cotton paper. These Limited Edition Fine Art Prints were carefully designed by artist Hayley Johnson and hand-printed by Virginia Green at BlackHare Studio , a letterpress and fine art studio in Waco, Texas. They’ll be numbered and signed. \nThe Sacred Ordinary Days Liturgical Wheel Calendar and Prayer Labyrinth were designed to be both functional and beautiful. They’ll be letterpressed with deep impressions for paper lovers (like us), for you to enjoy as graphic art on the wall and then take down to use. Use the Liturgical Wheel Calendar to visualize the liturgical seasons and how they fit into your year. \nTrace around the Prayer Labyrinth with your finger or let your eyes “walk” as a meditation throughout the day. We have ours in record album frames without glass, easy to take down and use or admire the deep impressions, no glare. If you’re new to either of these tools, don’t worry – they’ll each come with instructions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already know most of the important information by now, but here are the final brass-tacks details. Sacred Ordinary Days is 7.75” x 8.75” x 1.25” with pages that are 7.5” x 8.5\". The velvety scratch-proof cover has withstood all our tests for spills, scratches, and normal wear and tear. The planner is a 13-month edition that runs from November 29, 2015 (the beginning of Advent) through December 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo hours with Jenn Giles Kemper and a small group of your choice -- your weekly small group, church staff, or whomever you like. If you're near Waco, Texas or want to cover travel, I'll come to you. If not, we'll meet by video chat. We can talk about spiritual practices, the liturgical calendar, avoiding burnout, or even the planner itself - whatever would be most helpful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Epiphany Retreat will take place in Waco, Texas January 15-17, 2016. We'll gather at 7pm on Friday, January 15th and end at 5pm on Sunday, January 17th. Dinner on Saturday night will be included. Sleeping accommodations and other meals are not included, but options will be made available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I'm Jenn Giles Kemper and I'm a Spiritual Director and a consultant for fellow small business owners and non-profit leaders. I've been an entrepreneur for 5 years, following years of ministry experience and studying in the Religion department at Baylor. Creating this planner and prepping it to launch on Kickstarter has been one of the hardest and most challenging things I've ever done. I'm so proud of what we've created together. You can see where we go from here at www.SacredOrdinaryDays.com  & www.JennGilesKemper.com.  You can connect with me on social media @JennGilesKemper. Don't forget to say hi! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHayley Johnson has been my right-hand woman and graphic designer for this project. She began working with me shorty after graduating from Baylor with a degree in graphic design. Her hand can be seen through out this project in the form of design, layout, and artwork. Actually, everything you hold in your hands will be the result of her incredible talent bringing my sketches and long-winded explanations to life. You can see more of her work at www.hayleyjohnsoncreative.com . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Crews joined the team more recently, when we realized our to-do list exceeded the time and energy we had before we needed to launch. She's our photographer and office manager. Thanks to Katie, we've been connecting with churches and schools that I wouldn't have had the energy to reach out to. And, our studio dance parties and instagram drool sessions are better. You can connect with Katie & her photography best through her facebook page . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanna Braud came on board after the campaign started and we realized that if we were going to steward this project and it's initial momentum well, that we'd need a little more help. Hanna is a graphic designer and has been creating the marketing graphics so that Hayley could focus on the planner content. She's also been helping with some website upgrades and outreach. Hanna's work is at www.hannabrauddesign.com . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant Kemper is an engineer by day, and the CFO of my business on evenings and weekends. (No, that wasn't in our marriage vows.) He has diligently created spreadsheets and made many pots of tea, both extremely valuable. Grant's also the one you'll talk to for bulk orders and international shipping. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wouldn't have been able to bring this project to life without the gracious and totally pro collaborators listed above.  \nJohn at Capital Printing in Austin, Texas has stuck with us through our endless questions and our many requests. John and Lynne have been dedicated to making this planner the highest quality possible. Through our relationship with them, we're working with a binder in Texas, too. \nRobert from Fullwrite Creative in Waco, Texas created the beautiful video at the intro of the campaign (up there a the top of the page). He blew us away with his ability to compile our long-winded story into a compelling and beautiful 4 minutes and 33 seconds. What a wonderful storyteller! \nVirginia from Blackhare Studio in Robinson, Texas is working on our letterpress prints. We got to spend an afternoon at her beautiful studio and see her vintage presses and drawers and drawers of type. We're dreaming up new ways to work more letterpress into our lives. \nWe are thankful to work with folks who have been encouraging, joyful and able to provide us with the best of the best! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges For those unfamiliar with Kickstarter, the main risk WAS that if this project didn’t meet the minimum funding goal of $20,000, then the printed edition of the planner wouldn’t get made for 2016. That’s why sharing the project with your friends is just as helpful as contributing. Thanks for being a part of our tribe in that way! Reaching our $20,000 goal in the first 52 hours meant that we knew it would happen.\n\nYou can get other backer questions answered at https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/backer+questions. For example, if you scroll down to \"How Do I Pledge?\" you will find written instructions and a video on how to select your reward.\n\nWe’re working with an incredible team of collaborators on the printing and binding of the planner, as well as the letterpress prints. You can read more about them above. Our main challenge is the turn-around time for the production of the planner. The printing and binding will take 4-6 weeks, which may mean that it’s not possible to get the planners on your doorstep before Advent (and the planner) begins. We’ll be doing everything in our power to make that possible, of course. We’ve got a whole group of supporters ready to pack and mail your rewards with love as soon as we get them from our production partners. That’s why we’ve set December 2015 as the estimated delivery date and not November 2015, even though that’s our goal. We always want to under-promise and over-deliver.\n\nFeel free to contact our team by using the link underneath our FAQ section or through our website at www.SacredOrdinaryDays.com. \n THANK YOU!

Please join the Mailing List to learn about new additions to the collection, and news about the project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you missed the Kickstarter Project or want to purchase additional SKULPTURES, please visit the WEBSITE LINK . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Project In my previous Kickstarter project , I created a digital menagerie of dozens of finely-detailed animal skulls, each derived from a CT scan of an actual specimen.  The digital files were used to make a 3D prints in various sizes and materials. These skulls were intended primarily as desktop sculptures to highlight the incredible beauty of nature's designs. I now present Skulptures , a collection of miniatures in \nexquisite detail, cast in bronze, brass, silver and gold. They can be \nworn as pendants and earrings, or exhibited as collectibles in tiny \nglass bell jar displays. \n\n\nSpider Monkey in Bronze with Bell Jar Display \n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlligator pendant in brass \n \n\n \n\n\n\nChimpanzee Keyring \n \n\n \n\n\n\nSkulptures in brass as bracelet charms \n \n\n \n\n\n\nImpala earrings in brass \n \n\n \n\nWHY? As a biologist and passionate lover of our natural world, I wanted to capture the details of the structure and essence of each animal in the collection.  With its highly accurate rendering of skeletal structure, a CT scan is an ideal tool for peering into the structures and souls of these animals.   Skulptures display the minute details of an actual individual animal as a representative of its species.  Each sculpture is in effect a “memento mori” or remembrance of the life and death of the individual and of the species. A collection of skeletal memorabilia is something I have always wanted to create.  Finally, the perfect convergence of CT scanning, software development, 3D printing, and lost wax casting allows the creation of these Skulptures. The Skulpture s Collection For this project, I have prepared a set of 18 tiny skulls, cast in white bronze, yellow bronze, brass, sterling silver and gold. They will be available at low promotional prices exclusively for this Kickstarter project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach skull comes with an 18 inch chain, and a postcard \"biography\" showing the animal skull in comparison to the size of the  pendant, and a brief discussion of the salient features of the animal. \n\n\nInformation card showing the size of the animal skull compared to the pendant \n \n\n \n\n\n\nBack side of the card giving details of the habits, anatomical feature, species relationship, and cultural references \n \n\n \nAt some of the reward tiers, Skulptures come with a glass bell jar on a stand.  Each replica is cast with a tiny hollow collar on the underside allowing you to mount the skull on the stand. New SKULPTURES! \n\n\nLet's not forget the primate, Homo sapiens \n \n\n \n\n\n\nFor the cowboys among us: A bull with horns \n \n\n \nProcess and Production I start with a high resolution CT scan of each animal skull.  Then, using radiology and 3D modeling software, I create a detailed digital model of the skull optimized for 3D printing.  With the detail of the original CT scan retained throughout the modeling process, each model is scaled down to a standard size suitable for a pendant. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe final model is sent to a 3D printer where a master is created in high resolution.  From there, the master is sent to a foundry that specializes in casting, fabrication and production services for the jewelry industry.  The tiny skull is molded in silicone, and used to make wax models for casting in precious metals. \n\n\nHigh resolution acrylic prototype print of the Ram skull pendant - See $15 Reward Tier \n \n\n \n\n\n\nMetal master print in silicone mold \n \n\n \n\n\n\nWax model ready for casting in precious metal \n \n\n \nThe REWARDS Each Skulpture in the collection is cast with both a loop and a collar.  The loop at the back of the skull allows the piece to be worn as a pendant on an 18\" chain that is included in every reward. In addition, each piece has a tiny collar at the base of the skull so that it can be mounted on a brass rod within a tiny glass bell jar on a stand. The Metal Castings To fulfill the rewards for this Kickstarter project, the Skulptures for this production run will be cast in white bronze, yellow bronze, brass, sterling silver and 14K gold. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I Need Your Support I will be using money from this project to fund a casting production run in bronze, silver and gold. Based on the suggestions and interests of supporters, I plan to create additional designs such as earrings and bracelet charms and to develop specialized animal collections such as endangered species, large cats, fossil animals, and others. Funding will also go towards an online presence as well as efforts to offer \nSkulptures to nature enthusiasts and collectors through gift shops at natural history \nand science museums. In addition, as I learned from my previous Kickstarter project, supporters are an enthusiastic and valuable resource for providing suggestions and assistance in focusing and shaping my project efforts.  I THANK YOU! Risks and challenges Having gained experience from my previous Kickstarter project, I have already encountered and worked out the software and technical problems involved in going from skull to CT scan, to 3D printing, to lost wax casting. That said, there are always new challenges that arise. For one, this project utilizes lost wax casting which is being done by a company in Philadelphia. To assure that this aspect of the project will function smoothly, I have visited the company and spent time with the owner, discussing all the details of producing the pieces and delivering them on schedule. \n\nAnother challenge in starting this project now is to make sure that I fulfill all of the rewards of my previous Kickstarter project which the same skulls which I have miniaturized for my current project. There are only about a dozen rewards pending, and these are already being printed. They will be sent to my backers within 10 days. \n\nWith your support, I am prepared to take on the challenges of my second Kickstarter project.

THE MOST GENEROUS OF OFFERS WAS MADE TO OUR KICKSTARTER PROJECT TODAY. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, ALL PLEDGES UP TO $1000 WILL BE MATCHED BY A PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORTER WHO WANTS US TO BE SUCCESSFUL!!!!!!   WOW!! WE CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT IT PROMPTED AN EVEN MORE GENEROUS OFFER! FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, ALL PLEDGES UP TO $2500 WILL BE MATCHED! WE ARE OVERWHELMED WITH LOVE AND SUPPORT FOR AND FROM OUR FAMILY OF FRIENDS AND POPCORN TRIBE!!!!!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU ……………………………….. XXXOOO SHERRY AND JEFF  XXXOOO  What do you get when you combine organic popcorn with gourmet flavors and love? COMET CORN!  Comet Corn was founded in 2002 out of our desire for delicious organic snacks at music festivals, ball games and camping. By popular request we started bagging our seasoned organic popcorn in 2011 and have filled our steadily increasing orders from a shared facility until now. In April 2014 we signed the lease for the Comet Corn popshop. Our new Certified Organic Processing Facility will allow us to label our products as Certified Organic and Non GMO. We will expand our product line and distribution, as well as host special events. With the help of our friends and supporters we will purchase the equipment we need, build out the pop shop facility and bring the same level of quality popcorn to a larger market. Its time to grow! \n With your help we can expand our Comet Corn universe to include the San Francisco Bay area. We have moved into our new location. Now its time to upgrade our popcorn equipment, and acquire organic certification. \nBRICK & MORTAR POP SHOP: Getting a full time facility was our first priority as we were only able to pop a few days a month at our old facility. We recently found a building in Santa Rosa and have begun to move in! \n\n EQUIPMENT UPGRADES: We are need a new popper that doubles our capacity, as well as a fill and weigh machine which will more efficiently allow us to package up our retail orders. ORGANIC CERTIFICATION: Organic is very important to us and we want our popcorn labeled with non-gmo and organic certification. \nCheck out what our customers say about us: Comet Corn - Reaching for the Stars \n In this article Phyllis Heagney of Oliver's Market (one of our retail customers) does a great job at telling our story. With your support we can produce more organic and delicious snacks while strengthening our community!\n \n\n\nHere is our new brick and mortar pop shop! With your help, this is where we will install our larger capacity popping equipment, package for our retail accounts, and hold popcorn parties and fundraisers for the community! \n \n\n \n\n\nWe invite you to hop on the Comet Tail and continue the ride with us! \n\n\nComet Corn Campaign Team Selfie \n \n\n \n\n\nWe want to thank the members of our \"team\" who have made this campaign possible; Carleen Weirauch the Goddess of Organization and Design, Master Greg Damron, who held the camera, mic and our hands throughout this process and last but not least, Jennifer Suoja who knit together the pieces into our video. Gratitude extended also to Greg Duncan, Beake Bros. Electric Company, Roger and Claire Simpson, Toby and Jerry Levine, Jim Hanley, Mark Simpson and all the \"popstars\" who have assisted over the years. Also, for the support of a multitude of family and friends that make up the Comet Corn universe/tribe.  Risks and challenges Before we jumped into this project holding hands, Jeff and I wanted to make sure we could be successful with it. Does our grower know of our plans and can he supply the corn? CHECK. Not only will our new distributor spread Comet Corn across the whole San Francisco Bay area, but he will re-use our specially built boxes to keep cardboard out of the waste stream. CHECK. Does our new \"pop shop\" meet all California state requirements? CHECK.\nFrankly, our biggest challenge to date was the Kickstarter Campaign itself. We put together a team of 3 amazing individuals who guided us through this process and is making us successful. If we can do this, we can overcome anything!

That was the question that confronted me when I thought about writing my next book.  I really wanted to create something different that would help people unlock their great ideas and get their mojo working.  As much as I love to write, I am also a great believer in journaling so I decided to create a journal that also included some of my own thoughts and stories interspersed within its pages, to give guidance and inspiration, and to help unlock cracking new ideas in your world. It took me a long time to decide how to do a journal that I felt was different enough to what was already available and was a perfect resource to help people unlock their next great idea for themselves or their business. Sometimes all we need is just a little prompt to help get the creative juices flowing. The Mojo Journal is what I am hoping to create, with your help, through Kickstarter.  It is very different to anything else I have ever done, but looking at the final artwork now, it is the project that I am the most proud of. I wanted to produce something that I would want in my backpack. A journal that provokes my thinking and draws the pen to page, something to inspire new ideas. When you need a shot of mojo, you simply open the pages of this journal and harvest the best of the best of your thoughts from months and years gone by. WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW \nThe design and artwork are completed and ready for production  \nThe photography shows final artwork of the actual journal we hope to produce \nWe have sourced printing, tentatively booked time on the printing presses and have fulfilment ready to roll  \nAll we need now is the funding to enable us to push the 'go' button on production and produce what I think will be a unique and valuable, thought-provoking journal \n \n\n\nPhoto of The Mojo Journal final artwork \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPhoto of The Mojo Journal final artwork \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPhoto of The Mojo Journal final artwork \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPhoto of The Mojo Journal final artwork \n \n\n \n\n\n TIMELINE \nThe Kickstarter campaign will run through October and, if fully funded, production will commence in early November 2016 \nEarly Bird reward dispatch is scheduled for mid November 2016 which allows for international delivery in time for Christmas 2016 \nRegular reward dispatch is scheduled for February 2017 \n A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GARY BERTWISTLE  Gary Bertwistle is an Australian best selling author of six books including Who Stole My Mojo? and The Vibe.

Gary also hosts the popular Mojo Radio Show podcast on iTunes and writes a weekly blog for thinkers called the Espresso . THANKS  My sincere thanks and total appreciation to go to my editor Gabbi Armstrong and digital management manager Emanda from Short Mac Sessions , who worked tirelessly to make my thoughts come together.  The look, feel and style is the work of my design guru, Sarah-Jane O’Hara (aka SJ) Chief Creative Chick @ Pod Create.

We will be ready to mail your rewards in NOVEMBER!! Our goal is to debut this issue at Wizard\nWorld Comic Con in Tulsa. We are asking for your support to help us continue making\nmore issues of this story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTDP Issue 0 and 1 have been met with the industry with great\nreviews despite being a bit different from other graphic novels.The Devils Pool is based on a real location\nin Southwest Missouri and is created using live actors as models for the\nphotography. Each frame is posed and\ncreated to enhance the emotion and give the book a more cinematic feel before\nbeing sent to the artist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The Devil's Pool is rich with symbolism and meaning that the reader must figure out on their own.  It is an engaging cinematic experience but one you will have to pour over many times to uncover all of the story secrets. We continue on and get deeper into the darkness with issue\n2. Here is a review of Issue 1 from Jake Tanner at Following\nthe Nerd “In many of our favorite comic book stories\nthe places, people, and events are totally fictional. Jeramie Worley and his\nteam approached Devil’s Pool with a slightly different idea: what if they based\na fictional story on a real place? That’s what we’re seeing in the first issue\nof this new horror series from Ark Vindicta. Benton Carver is an EMT in his\nhome town and leads a pretty normal life until his sister is tragically\nmurdered. He suspects more is afoot than your average robbery though and takes\nit upon himself to investigate the details. What he digs up is a line of\ncorruption that runs deeper than he ever suspected and ends up thrown into the\nDevil’s Pool wounded and missing an eye. What happens next is more than he ever\nbargained for… I met Jeramie Worley at Wizard World St. Louis and after talking\nto him for a few minutes he told me about his idea for Devil’s Pool.\n(Apparently it’s a local landmark!) After he explained that it was going to be\na horror story grounded in a real place I was sold. While I don’t find it scary\n(it takes a lot to rattle me with horror stories) it is an extremely intriguing\ntale of corruption, redemption, and even the supernatural. Ben is an extremely\nrelatable character and I really dig that about him. Before his sister is murdered\nhe lived a life many of us are akin to. He’s always busy with work and has\ntrouble finding time for the people he cares about or even for himself. It’s\nthat kind of connection that will keep people coming back to this story. The\nart in this book is pretty solid. Apparently they used all live actors to pose\nfor the panels in this book and it shows. A lot of the character models are\nextremely detailed but it’s the really grotesque and supernatural events that\nreally shine in the first issue of this book. The colors are absolutely\nbeautiful …” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out our kickstarter. We hope you find us worthy of your support.  Risks and challenges The risks and challenges are very minimal for this project as all the art and lettering are complete. We are just waiting on the funds to go to print. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

It’s my\nnew novel, never before published, and it has everything I love\nabout space opera. \n\nRip-roaring adventure. Abandoned planet. Empty cities. No\nsign of the builders—not even an image of the species that lived there. No name\nin any language that human archaeologists can read. For convenience, they call\nit Nevermore. \n\nA mysterious stranger, who may be human, may be alien, may\nbe both, who will stop at nothing to find the answer to the mystery. \n\nSpace pirates. Planet wreckers. Renegade intelligence\nagents. Runaway telepaths. Sentient starships. Horses, even—my writing partners\ninsist on that. With the help of over 100 backers, Forgotten Suns has funded. It will be an ebook from Book View Café. If it funds\nfar enough above goal, we’ll be able to commission an original cover, and if we\ndo even better than that, we’ll add a printed edition. \n\n Meet me at the spaceport. We’re shipping out to Nevermore. Curious about what this all means? Check out the excerpt in Update #1. Now it's time to aim for some stretch goals. I will be adding to them and refining them as we go, but here's what I have in mind at this point: $6000 We've made it to the first stretch goal! The backer who put us over has had their reward upgraded to the next tier. And I've fulfilled my promise to write the first 1000 words of a story set in the world of the novel. The story includes ponies. In space. I have been asked (repeatedly) for them, and I've done my best to oblige. It's posted as Update 8, open to backers. Update 9 offers a snippet for all who may be curious as to what we're doing behind the curtain. $7500 We've reached the second stretch goal! I'll add two more ebooks to the bundle for backers $60 and above: Arrows of the Sun and Spear of Heaven . More prequels. More adventure. All ebooks, I should add, are DRM-free. We don't do DRM here. And for everybody who backs the project, I've written another installment of the story. $10000 I'll finish the story, and all backers will see how it ends. For backers $100 and above, I'll do a chapbook of the story, signed and personalized. I'll also, for all backers, share the process of completing, revising, and preparing the novel for publication--including snippets of draft, the editorial letters, and my notes on revision. Backers will get an inside view of the process of creating Forgotten Suns. $12500 Original cover art by an amazing pro artist: the brilliant and talented Julie Dillon. Backers will see the art first, from sketch to final. We're dreaming on past this to a print edition and a possible second volume--at least a novella that carries on the story. Maybe...maybe... Let's see how high we can fly. Risks and challenges I've been a fulltime working writer since 1985. That means I've done this before and will do it many more times, because I just can't kick this writing habit. Just as I used to be accountable to my publishers for meeting deadlines, now I'm accountable to you, the backers of this project.\n\nThe novel as of this moment is about two-thirds written. I'm adding words by the day and expect to complete it by this fall. Drop-dead date for the draft is December, after which it will be edited and revised.\n\nI will do my best to meet the deadline for completion and revision of the novel, and to get it into your hands by the date promised. If life should intervene, I will keep you up to date on progress and provide you with a revised timetable for completion and publication.

    "textDescription": "Story It all started with a question: What does it mean to live a dream?  Over the last two years, we've been hard at work developing the techniques and tools to produce something we call \"Dreamscapes.\" Dreamscapes are a type of Virtual Reality experience that allow users to unknowingly transition from one location to another, just like the dreams you may remember having as you sleep.  Why is this such a big deal?\n\n Imagine standing in your bedroom and something catches the corner of your eye. As you turn to look, you realize you're in the bowels of a ship, suddenly off on some foreign adventure. When you turn back to return to your bedroom, \n\nyou discover not pillow cases and quilts but the lush foliage and distant animal chirps of a fantastic forest. Now, imagine not remembering how you first entered the bedroom, then the ship, and then the forest. Dreamscapes are a spatial sleight of hand that we could never fully experience firsthand, outside of our own rest, until the advent of what we now call \"dreamscaping.\" Potential Synergy is nearing the release of our unprecedented first Dreamscape experience, The Dream Cube, for the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard. The Dream Cube is the first spatial puzzle of its kind; users will be challenged to find an escape from the ever-evolving environmental maze without time limits or final bosses to conquer. Part game, part visual stimulation, the Dream Cube demo we created in partnership with Third Wish Media (www.thirdwishmedia.com ) and Clinkenfims (www.clinkenfilms.com ) was chosen as a finalist for Samsung's Gear VR killer app contest in 2016, and we've only just begun. (https://www.samsungdevelopers.com/2016/12/winners-of-the-samsung-gear-vr-killer-app-contest/ ) We're developing 9 increasingly mind-warping Dreamscape \"level mazes\" that we want to refine before our scheduled release this spring. We're focusing on publishing via mobile platforms currently because of the accessibility, \nbut we've been hard at work improving our Dreamscape experiences with position tracked systems like the HTC Vive and Oclulus Rift. In a short while, we'll be taking our efforts to the next level with eye tracking systems like the Fove. \n However, our stretch goals will determine how quickly we can bring Dreamscapes to multiple platforms and how soon we'll be able to release new content. \n\n If we reach our $70k developer stretch goal below, we'll even make many of our tools available on the Unity Asset store, in addition to producing tutorials on Twitch and YouTube, so you can begin making your own VR content come to life.  -CLICK HERE TO GET THE DEMO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF - Funding Stretch Goals $10,000 - 3 Level Version for Gear VR - Spring 2017 Release $20,000 - 6 Level Version for Gear VR - Summer 2017 Update  $30,000 - 9 Level Version for Gear VR - Fall 2017 Update $40,000 - 9 Level Version for Google Cardboard for android/Google Daydream - Fall 2017 Release $50,000 - 9 Level Version for Google Cardboard for iOS/3 extra level bonus for Gear VR and Cardboard - Fall 2017 Update/Release  $60,000 - First Dreamscape Narrative Short in Partnership with ClinkenFilms - Fall 2017 Early Access $70,000 - Developer Dreamscape Toolkit for Unity 3D  - Fall 2017 Release $80,000 - 9 Level Version for WebVR - Fall 2017 $90,000 - 3 Level Version for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift - Winter 2018 $100,000 - The real game begins...  Risks and challenges We've been able to make it on our own steam up to this point, but now we're seeking funds for:\n\n\n- Audio design (its half the experience and we what to do it right)\n- Texturing and lighting (these are our tools for getting the mood juuuust right)\n- UI design (a good user interface makes for a happy home)\n- Mobile optimization (we're fitting a lot in a tiny package)\n- User testing (the more feed back we can get, the more refined the final product)\n- Child care (someone needs to watch the kids when we're out at VR events) Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story Are YOU ready to hear what 'Honey' really sounds like? Over the past few months I have been vigorously studying my craft by exploring new genres, writing, and working to create a distinctive sound that allows me to vocalize my message across to each and every one of you. Needless to say, I've been inspired by a diverse group of artists throughout my life. By embracing these musical influences, I have crafted an innovative sound that not only reflects who I am as an artist, but really pushes musical boundaries. My sound is powerful, energetic, electric, and passionate, which is everything that I want my audience to experience. Why I Need Your Help The music industry is very different from when I was little. Artists don't get \"discovered\" any more - we have to launch our own careers. With the amount of support I have received from you all in the past, I know that I can self-launch. But I need your help to do it! What is an EP? An EP (extended play) is a musical recording that consists of more than one single, but is too short to qualify for a full studio album.  Where Your Money Goes Recording and releasing an EP is expensive, but extremely vital for an independent artist. In order to make this EP the absolute best it can be, I really need your help.\n Here is some of what goes into making an album: Studio costs, writing sessions, mixing, mastering, album art, legal fees, duplication, and promotion (just to name a few). With your help, I will be able to create a product that you and I can both be proud of. I want nothing more than to be able to share the passion in each one of my songs with broad audiences around the world, and with your help, I will be able to do that!\n Goal: To raise $12,000 to fund my EP Stretch Goals Stretch Goal #1 - $17,000: Getting my music heard is what it is all about! I want to be able to reach a larger audience by placing my music and story on blogs, papers and even the radio. This would go towards promotion for my EP!\n Stretch Goal #2 - $19,000: If we are able to reach $19,000 I will be able to release a fully produced music video with the release of my first single!\n So… Why Am I Doing This? Ever since I was a little girl I've dreamed about having my music heard. I've devoted my entire life to becoming the best I can be not only as a singer, but also as an artist. In my heart, I know that this is what I was born to do. I've always been someone who has had to listen to music wherever I go. Driving in the car, exercising, working, even sitting around the house… I've always lived my life to music. It has always enhanced my emotions, whether it is anger, excitement, or sadness. Sometimes you just need to shut the world off, and turn the music up. I want to be the artist you turn up. I want to be the voice in the car with you driving to work. And I want to show you who I am through the power of music. There have been many struggles and bumps along the way, but finally I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be and this is what I'm supposed to be doing. I want to be able to move people emotionally through my music and voice, and I truly believe that this EP will achieve that. With your help, we can make this dream a reality and share this music with the world. Risks and challenges This is really scary, but also extremely exciting! \n\nIf we don't reach the entire goal of $12,000 in 25 days, we get nothing! I need your help spreading the word!\n\nMaking YOU happy is my number one priority! If there are any bumps along the way, I will make sure everything is handled in a timely fashion and to YOUR liking.\n\nThank you again for all your support! I couldn't do this without you. :) Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

I want to capture images, share the things I learn, open peoples eyes and make a positive impact. I saved up to buy a camera and computer and a one way ticket to India to learn, travel, explore and share what I found with the world through my films. So far I have been on the road for one and half years, traveling India, USA and Latin America. During this time I have made 17 short documentaries which are avaliable to view on youtube under the name auroras eye films... www.youtube.com/auroraseyefilms   However my laptop has just been stolen in Ecuador and I cant edit any of my footage....this is where i need your help. I just need to buy a new laptop then i can start editing and making more documentaries. The latest film I was working on was about Organic coffee in Columbia and the process that goes into farming and producing coffee. Working with the local people I collected lots of footage and interviews, which are awaiting to be edited. This would be the first project I start once I have received my new computer...thanks to you! The goal of this film is to reconnect people back with coffee. I feel that there is such a coffee culture at the moment, however people have forgotten about how its made. Many of us just take it for granted. So this film is all about the process of coffee, how its made, who makes it, and what is Organic coffee? Also i will be sharing the techniques on different methods of making a decent cup of coffee at home.  I was fortunate to stay on a organic coffee farm in columbia for a few weeks, in the most famous region where coffee is one of the best in the world. There i learnt all the process of coffee, and the different techniques to create different flavours. I collected lots of footage, and spoke to many of the local farmers and village people. I would love to share this story with you all... The film attached is an example of my work, I hope you enjoy... Risks and challenges Well I have good news all my footage from my camera and computer was backed up....so I still have everything saved! This would have been my biggest challenge...getting all the footage I have taken over the last year and half on the road!\n\nSo all I have to do is edit it. Once I have my new computer there is no stopping me. loosing my computer was my biggest risk and challenge, but having a back up has helped me overcome this. \n\nThe biggest challenge could be loosing any of my equipment in the future. I will ensure I always keep a back of all my footage and films. I will make sure I find a decent insurance company that will cover any loss next time.

The history and mystery of Victorian mansions are the inspiration for Artistic Director Kelli Leighton's dynamic 80-minute work, The Doorway . The Doorway premiered in October 2010, and was so popular, that we want it to be a yearly performance in our repertory. Layered with character, emotion, and detail, the athletic contemporary and jazz movement is inspired by the unique personality of the rooms in a Victorian mansion. The Doorway follows the dark and quirky characters entangled within the house: from portraits in 'The Gallery' - seeing the hidden story behind the pictures; to the eerie 'Playroom' - where a lonely little girl acts out her frustration on her living dolls; to the sinister 'Basement'. This fall, we have exciting opportunities for The Doorway - we are adding 'The Garden' to the show, and we have the amazing honor of being invited to perform 'The Playroom' at the 11th Annual DUMBO Dance Festival through White Wave. With performances at several venues along the DUMBO waterfront in Brooklyn, New York, the 3-day festival hosts dance companies from around the world, and we are so excited to represent Sacramento! Your help is essential in bringing The Doorway to the stage this fall! All the dancers volunteer their time, so the funds raised through this project will go directly to costume the dancers in 'The Garden', help cover theater rental fees, and travel costs to New York for the festival.

    "textDescription": "Story A few months ago Sam Rayner and I thought, it just might be possible to write a comedy which blended our love of Blaxploitation cinema and period farce. The zany result was a play - written over a few days (and mostly over one purgatorial night) - just in time for a new-writing prize deadline. Over the following weeks we recrafted the rough draft, got a producer on board and decided to take our madcap show to the Edinburgh Fringe. We now have an incredibly talented, experienced cast and production team, publicist, accommodation and a great venue - The Underbelly Cowgate. \nThe only thing we are lacking is funding for production costs - and a few of our actors who will struggle to cover the rental costs of fringe accommodation. \nWe need your help to make the dream a reality - and to immerse our Edinburgh audience in an overwhelming sensuous extravaganza!  https://www.underbelly.co.uk/node/5656214 \nhttps://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/nougat-for-kings Risks and challenges Aside from rehearsing the show and making it the best it can be both theatrically and musically - in our short (and intensive) rehearsal period in mid-July, we face challenges in designing an affordable and adaptable set and costume to make the characters and locations in the play as clear as possible. Training the actors in stage combat sequences will prove challenging and hard work - but will be very rewarding once on the stage in Edinburgh.

Thank you all for your continued support and encouragement. The puppets appreciate it and so do we! THANK YOU!! SAG-AFTRA New Media SO YOU'RE GOING TO EMPLOY UNEMPLOYED PUPPETS?? EXACTLY! The rehabilitated puppets will be cast in a quirky, new independent web-series called Just Makeda.  \nJust Makeda is about a girl named, you guessed it, Makeda and her puppet alter ego, Just Mak. JM is a CRAZY BIATCH. She comes out when Makeda gets drunk, high, angry or self conscious. She's the party animal, the STD contractor, the girl that does too much coke and makes Makeda deal with The Morning After... The series follows the girls as they run into odd jobs and even odder acquaintances, including but not limited to: Sometimes Dasha (Dasha Kittredge), Occasionally Arianna (Arianna Lyons) and Just John (John Boonin) - a love interest who may or may not have his own puppet \"alter\". The overall feel of the show is funny, awkward, and inappropriately debaucherous, but its heart always shines through. WHO ARE THOSE COOL PUPPETS IN THE VIDEO? \n\n\nOH, THESE GUYS?? \n \n\n \n\nMeet Just Makeda and Just John - recently rehabilitated puppets from the hard streets of Echo Park who are well on their way to Hollyweird stardom. But ALSO, Makeda built these little guys with her own two hands using YouTube videos as a guide. WOW. This is what they've been up to: Thus faaaarrr, two episodes have been shot using favors and a whole lotta promises (Jose promised his first born to at least three people). With your contributions, Just Makeda will shoot the remaining episodes in June and July and have them available for your viewing pleasure by August.

We could find ourselves hating the scripts, hating each other, wanting to quit. We could find out that one of our cast or crew members has deserted us to join the circus. We could decide that we aren't meant to be artists and get caught up in a series of existential crises!!!!\n\nBut we can handle it. We all have extensive experience on set and as collaborators and are skilled at trouble shooting. Our creativity doesn't stop at our given titles for this project, we will apply it wherever necessary to accomplish our goals and to get 'er done!

While there I became enamored with the culture and the landscape; returning home with some of the most beautiful images I may have ever made, a story that needed to be written, and an invitation to explore more of Scandinavia, by way of my travel companion and very dear friend Sandra who lives in Sweden. \nIn mid-May, I will be flying to Sweden, land of gorgeous, icy blondes, medieval cities and birch forests for ten days and mirroring my Icelandic photographic project. I plan on exploring Stockholm, the Archipelago, and possibly the more northern reaches of the country. My hope ultimately is to create a series of images similar in breadth to what I created in Iceland (which you can see here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/kicey/sets/72157617315940340/ ), and a book with a travel essay that I will design and make available to backers via Blurb (by private invitation until I am able to find a publisher). \nEssentially the funding will help me offset the cost of traveling to and around Sweden, including flight, trains, car rental, gas, hotels, and food. It also goes towards making prints for backers, including packing materials and postage, giving me a slight financial buffer while putting the book together, and purchasing proof copies of the book when it is complete so that it is beautiful and perfect for those that would like to own it. \nI expect to have all images processed and available here by early June: http://www.flickr.com/photos/kicey/sets/72157623413203691/ (the self-portrait of me was not taken in Sweden, nor is it available as a print). I will set to writing as soon as humanly possible upon returning, along with designing the book. There will be 2 designs - a 12\"x12\" hard cover 'coffee table' version (approximately $75) and a smaller hardcover 7\"x7\"(which is more affordable to produce - at approximately $30) - I only mark up the base prices on Blurb a couple dollars so I am NOT making a bundle on sales of these books.

I've been upcycling books into book journals for a while now.  I find books that have been loved and are lovely, take them apart, and insert new blank paper, cards and other fun emphera and rebind them.  I sell the recycled book journals on my website ( http://www.paperbutterflyforge.com  ) and at local Seattle craft fairs. \n\n\nUpcycled Book Journals \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Page of Book Journal \n \n\n \n\n\n          While deconstructing the vintage books, I've been ending up with a surplus of book pages.  I've been making book pom poms out of the extra pages.     What is a book pom pom?  It's definitely not called a book ball.  I've been advised that might be poor name for them. (Although, telling people that I spent my evening gluing my balls together, is absolutely hilarious.)  The jokes write themselves. A book pom pom is a reuseable decorative floral replacement that looks great at events, on bookshelves, or coffee tables.  Perfect decorations for book clubs, coffee houses or other eco-decorations. They come in two different formats: Edgy book pom poms in natural: \n\n\nEdgy Book Pom Pom \n \n\n \n\n\n \n Floral book pom pom in natural: \n\n\nFour Inch Floral Book Pom Pom \n \n\n \n\n\nWhy do I create upcycled book journals and book pom poms?   \nReusing existing materials should be a goal of everyone.  I find books in thrift shops, garage sales, library sales.  In addition, people also bring me found paper and old books.  I spend a bit of time mending hard cover books before upcycling them.  I don't think most people have a clue how many books are thrown away each year.  \nCreating something of substance that makes other people happy is a positive experience. \nI have always enjoyed writing in my own journals and have does so since the third grade when it was assigned in a class.  I have always been on search for the perfect journal.  And finally now that I create my own journals, I finally have enough!   \n An NPR article on throwing away books: http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2011/10/12/141265066/hard-choices-do-libraries-really-destroy-books \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere will the money go to?   I will be purchasing/making some bookbinding tools to expand my tool kit.  I'd also like to take some bookbinding or letterpress classes. Bookbinding classes can be expensive, but it would be nice to have an extra $200 to spend on education. \n\n\nFound Note in Hardy Boys Book \n \n\n \n\n\nSome helpful bookbinding tools that are on my wish list: \nAwl - Funded $10 to $15.00 for two awls. \nSquare Angle Rule - Estimate $10 to $15 \nHand Drill (manual) in an appropriate size.- Estimate $30 to $40 \nGlue Brushes about $10.00 Each \nA variety of bone folders \nNeedle tool \nBook Press \nSpring Divider \nFrench Backing Hammer \nJapanese Hole Punch \nSteel Tear Bar \nReach goal:  A larger paper cutter that can cut over fifty sheets and a chip board.  ($500 or so) \n Supplies: \nA variety of PVA glues that I can test. \nSpecialty papers that I can test. \nA supply of chipboard that I can test. \n Classes: \nLetterpress classes \nCoptic Stitch lessons \nWorkshops on bookbinding. \n Some of these items are inexpensive others are rather pricey.  I'd appreciate the help upgrading my small tools and education.  As the rewards are pledged, I'll let you know the progress towards the small tools and classes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch goals: Book pom poms made with distressed paper at $500 in funding.  Rewards will be available in distressed paper and natural book pages. Also, if you are in the Seattle area, come check them out in person at the local craft fairs.  http://paperbutterflyforge.com/events/ \n\n\nAt the Fremont Sunday Market \n \n\n \n\n\n Thank you very much for checking out my latest Kickstarter.  Like all of the previous crowdfunding campaigns the goals are modest and will provide seed money for my tiny workshop!   (The Lore Bits game tokens are on the cookie trays if you look closely!) \n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges Challenges: \n\nI might become overwhelmed with pledges and take a bit too long to fulfill the rewards. That has happened before, I ended up being about six weeks late on delivering rewards. It was pretty stressful. I've staggered the rewards for different months to reduce the problem. It might be late, but you will absolutely receive your reward. :)\n\nRisks: \n\nI might glue my fingers together. I've done that before, so I know I will survive the experience. Hurts a bit though!\n\nRunning out of materials. This is rather unlikely. Once you start upcycling objects, you realize how much our society disposes on a daily basis. There is an endless supply of books to upcycle. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "

    "textDescription": "Story Aloha from Kihei, Maui, Hawaii!   I'm thrilled to share Beach Dance here on Kickstarter and I'm excited to promote a form of conscious dance this way. Before I tell you what The BIG Ask is and make a request for your support, I'd like to share a short story of Beach Dance with you.  What exactly is Beach Dance?  Beach Dance is a free-form dance experience where movement, music and nature merge together. With the use of modern technology (Apple iPod shuffles), a one hour playlist of evocative music is pre-synched before each event to the iPods so that every participant can listen and dance to the same music at relatively the same time.  I created Beach Dance seven years ago out of my love of the ocean and passion for conscious (also known as ecstatic) dance. Combining the two seemed like a sweet idea. After wondering (it was really more like procrastinating) whether anyone else besides myself would think dancing on the beach with others would be fun, I purchased fifteen iPods and invited fifteen friends to test it it out. It was a rather cool and gray day along the Oregon coast, but they all showed up.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir enthusiastic feedback convinced me to launch my creative baby into the world and on June 21, 2008, I held the first public Beach Dance. For the next four years, approximately twenty-five events were held every summer in Cannon Beach, Oregon. It grew in popularity over time and then...a rather sweet surprise happened while I was vacationing and participating in a dance retreat on Maui in February 2011. I had the opportunity to facilitate a Beach Dance with 25 people and it was during that particular event when a certain photo was taken that led to an even bigger surprise.       Beach Dance got some BIG press.  \n\n\nOn the Summer 2011 cover of Conscious Dancer magazine. \n \n\n \n\n\nThis was quite an honor and gave Beach Dance national exposure. While this recognition made me feel incredibly proud, what has given me the most satisfaction over the past seven years (and it's truly the best kind of reward for what I do) is hearing the feedback from people who have participated in the events. Far and above any other compliment, the most frequent one that's given happens to be my favorite and it's also one of the reasons why I've created this campaign.  \"I feel so free.\"  \n\n\nLayne Lakefish \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nJoe McLaughlin \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNicole Smith \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Paige \n \n\n \n\n\nIt's a compliment I never tire of hearing. It always puts a smile on my face and it makes me wonder what it is about this experience that helps people feel this way. Perhaps it's the music. Perhaps it's dancing outdoors with nature. Perhaps it's moving one's body in such a way that the spirit is moved as well. I suspect it's a combination of these factors, but it really doesn't matter. What matters is having the freedom to creatively and authentically express ourselves without fear of being judged, criticized or excluded. And so it is with Beach Dance.  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n \n\n\n\n\nPlay\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with sound\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 \n \n\n00:00 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nI said this was going to be a short story, didn't I?   Fast forward to January 2012 and Beach Dance begins in Maui, Hawaii. Having moved to the island four months prior from Oregon, I was excited to begin offering events in the middle of winter! With blue skies, sunshine and average temperatures in the low 80's year-round, Beach Dance could now be offered all the time.  And so for the past 2 1/2 years, I've been hosting weekly dances and have made it a free offering. I use to charge $15-20 per event while it was based in Oregon, but when I moved to Hawaii, there were a few reasons why I made the change. (You can read more about those reasons here if you'd like.) There was another change that happened when Beach Dance moved to Maui that was unexpected. Unlike the Pacific Northwest where the ocean temperature is an instantaneous toe-numbing one that the bravest of Beach Dancers would cautiously venture into with their feet, here in Maui the water's always bathtub-warm and people want to jump right in. \n\n\nJimmy Freeheart \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Marks & Renee Firefly \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRose Gabriel \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHome & Koa Le'amohala \n \n\n \n\n\nThere's just one little problem with that...the iPod shuffles we use are not waterproof. Despite my reminders to participants of that fact, it's easy to get lost in your own dance and forget about that or anything else I've said until a wave takes you down.  \n\n\nAnd that's how 20 iPods have met their watery death. \n \n\n \n\n\nAnd how I started buying used iPods off of Craigslist and EBay to replace the ones that died. It's also how I came to learn about waterproof iPods. And when a friend gifted one to me for my birthday last December, it profoundly changed the experience of my own dance. It also got me thinking that everyone else who came to Beach Dance should have the opportunity to experience dancing in and underwater if they'd like to without having to worry about ruining the iPod they're wearing. It's time to take Beach Dance to the next level of freedom.  \n\n\nYours truly, Lila \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFully immersed, floating music experience \n \n\n \n\n\nWhat's the BIG Ask?  I would love your financial support to purchase a minimum of 25 waterproof iPods and waterproof headphones and to produce an epic underwater ecstatic dance event on 12/13/14. The more money that's raised, the bigger the event will be. More iPods will be purchased. More people can attend the event. More delicious pu-pus (Hawaiian appetizers) at the after event party. Most importantly...more opportunities for more people to dance and feel more free during the regular events that are held on Maui every week. \nI'd love to see Beach Dance become one of the premier land and water activities that people want to participate in when they visit the island. With your help financially and socially-media wise, I believe it could happen. I also believe dance is one of the most fun, creative and beautiful ways we can connect to ourselves and with each other. Beach Dance is my creative outlet, my spiritual practice, my work, but it's also my contribution to infusing the world with more goodness and glee.    I've crafted some unique and sweet rewards for you to choose from. Personalized music playlists (delivered to you in a totally fun way!), fun(ny) t-shirts, private Beach Dance events, photo sessions with the amazing Richard Marks , beautiful accommodations when you come to Maui and of course, opportunities to be a part of the epic underwater ecstatic dance event on 12/13/14. I thought you might enjoy seeing a few photos of our home if you choose one of the rewards to come to Maui and stay with us..  \n\n\nRelax on a lounge chair & splash in our pool! \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe view from our suite. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nKing size bed in the suite. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSpectacular sunset from our lanai. \n \n\n \n\n\nI would love your support and so would all the people who will have the chance to experience Beach Dance in the water in the near future. I hope to dance with you someday on Maui. If not on 12/13/14, some other time perhaps. Beach Dance is a sure thing for me. I'll be dancing until the very end.  \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges There are minimal risks and challenges to this project. \n\nThe greatest challenge I can foresee is if the weather is overcast and rainy on the day of the event, some participants will frown on being on the beach and in the water and won't show up. The likelihood of the weather doing something completely extraordinary on the south side of the island is rare, but it could happen. If the rain was ridiculously coming down and/or the wind was fierce and either made the ocean unsafe or reduced the water's visibility,we'd need to postpone the event to a different day. My hope would be that we could hold the event the very next day so those folks who were on the island visiting could still participate.

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Island Boys\" is a new play, coming to New York City this November. What Is The Play About? Jonah and William are the lone two survivors of a shipwreck that made their high school retreat national news. The boys and their classmates were stranded on a dessert island for months before a ship found them, with only the two left alive. Today is the five year anniversary of the boys' rescue, and Jonah has agreed to go on a popular morning news program to discuss the incident and life since. However, when William unexpectedly shows up on Jonah's doorstep for the first time since they were rescued, the boys are forced to face the demons they've been trying to hide for the last five years.  Why This Play? Why Now? For us, the purpose of theater is to hold the mirror up, and look at ourselves honestly, and then ask why we are the way we are. The play deals with issues like PTSD, gender roles, media censorship, and religion's place in our lives today. We ask questions like \"Can you close Pandora's Box after a traumatic event, or are you forever changed by it?\" \"How much of the truth does the media and our government actually tell us?\" and \"Is the society we've built and the walls we hide behind really that much safer than the wilderness 'out there'\"? Many of these issues are modern day, relevant struggles that we struggle with daily. These are some of the consequences of the world we  have built, and we believe this play really asks those questions to get us to understand ourselves in a deeper, more honest way. Time & Place \"The Island Boys\" will run at Urban Stages in Manhattan, located at: 259 W 30th St.New York, NY 10001 Performance Times:Friday, November 13th @ 7:30PMSaturday, November 14th @ 2:00PMSaturday, November 14th @ 7:30PMSunday, November 15th @ 2:00PMSunday, November 15th @ 2:00PM The Team (So Far) Playwright: Ryan MarconeDirector: Taylor NortonStage Manager: Bernadette MaassLighting Design: Aaron TacyCostume Design: Elonna BettiniScenic Design: Reilly Miller The Cast Riley: Mia Hutchinson-ShawJonah: Ryan MarconeWilliam: Adam SchneemannThe Island Boy/Ensemble: Callan Suozzi-Rearic Our Budget We are looking to raise $6,500 for the project, which breaks down as follows:Theater Rental: $4,000Rehearsal Space: $1,000Cast and Designer Stipends: $1,000Printing, Marketing, and Other Expenses: $500 Risks and challenges It is difficult being a self-sustaining artist in New York City. Even more difficult is creating and developing new work. Theater costs a lot to develop, and so people are sometimes wary of supporting new work. We are also working with a small cast, only four actors, so our resources we can draw on from them are even more limited than in other productions. For new work to be created, a whole community must believe in it, and that is what we are asking of you...simply believe in something new!

    "textDescription": "Story \nInspired by two classic photo books, PICTURES FROM \"AMERICA\" contemplates people and places in the USA of 2014.\n My aim is to create a portrait of this country in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when the American Empire is in decline. I’m documenting a historic moment in the life of the nation. With American Photographs (1938), Walker Evans essentially invented the photo book as we know it. His pictures of people and places during the Great Depression created a moving account of hardship and endurance.  \n\nTwenty years later, Robert Frank, a recent immigrant, made The Americans in homage to Evans’ book, even down to the design. In 1958, he documented a society divided by race and class, changing at the margins.\n\n I'm continuing that conversation. Original photographs and writing will reflect our times, in formats that also suggest our current age:  \n\n\nThe book, a one-of-a-kind art object, responds to the recent decline of print publishing by expanding the physical possibilities of the book format.  \nAn online e-book will be available for viewing and download to all supporters who pledge $15 or more. \nAll supporters can submit one photograph each for possible inclusion in the project. \nAn exhibition featuring the physical and online books and photographic prints will open at 205 Hudson Street Gallery, New York, in December 2014. \nSupporters at the $50 level and above will receive a signed print of the photo they choose when the project is completed. Many other rewards are listed at right! \n I have already shot photographs for the book in New York, New Mexico, California, and Florida. \n\n\n\n\n\nHOW FUNDING WILL HELP \n\n Kickstarter support will subsidize the costs of photographing diverse people and places across the country and prints for the book and exhibition.  I CAN DO THIS: PICTURES FROM \"AMERICA\" IS MY SECOND BOOK AND EXHIBITION I spent a year working on OPEN CLOSETS, a book and exhibition that explores the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender experience in modern-day Shanghai.  My solo exhibition was a centerpiece of Shanghai Pride 2010 and portions of the exhibit were included in group shows in New York and Oakland. The book is available for preview and purchase at blurb.com . \"Unsettlingly powerful. The chapter about the older men in the park simply broke my heart.\" -- Christopher Chan \"A groundbreaking book on this subject. These images are quite revealing and poignant at the same time.\" -- Tommy Wu \n\n\n\n\n\nARTIST’S STATEMENT PICTURES FROM \"AMERICA\" will reinvent what a photo book can be. Because bookstores are closing and printed books are harder to produce, I'm expanding the boundaries of book-ness, offering a physical experience that can’t be reproduced online.  \n\n\nInteractivity has become a big part of online publishing, so that’s why I’m excited to invite supporters to submit photographs for the project.  \nThe gallery show will include the book, the e-book, and prints that hang on walls.  \nPICTURES FROM “AMERICA” is social commentary as a multi-media, multi-sensory experience.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT THE PROJECT AND I'LL GIVE YOU ART! \nTo make a pledge to PICTURES FROM \"AMERICA,\" click the green “Back This Project” button at the top of this page.   \nYou will be asked to enter your pledge amount. Then, you will go through and must complete the Amazon checkout process.  \nYou won't be charged unless I receive pledges worth $10,000.  \nBecause funding is all-or-nothing, I can always raise more than my goal but never less. \nCrowd funding is social! Whether you do or don't support the project with a donation, please share it with your network!! \nIf my project is successfully funded, Kickstarter will charge me 5% of the funds raised, and Amazon will charge me credit card processing fees (about 3-5%), so that's what they get for their services. In other words, they won't add to your charge, but they do reduce the overall amount that comes to me. If I don't meet my funding goal, there are no fees. \n \n \n Risks and challenges To keep costs low, I plan to rent a car and bring camping gear. Aside from the usual risks associated with driving, it could be a challenge to find a suitable campground in certain locales. To pay my bills at home, I’ll keep working at my freelance job about 15 hours a week; fortunately the hours are flexible, but I’ll need to find public hotspots.\n\nFulfillment entails no risk at all.

    "textDescription": "Story                        THE MOBILE GRIP GEAR STORY One beautiful Saturday morning last July I was running across THIS bridge... \n\n\n\n\n\nYes I know...why was I running across THAT bridge in the first place? Well, it always seems like a great idea until I'm at the bottom staring up. So I'm midway across that bridge when my phone rings, and being a mother it is only right that I am always accessible when away from my daughter right? Right. The only problem is I was wearing one of these things at the time. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to answer my phone while running I nearly slung it in the river. Thank goodness for quick reflexes because I reached over just in time to catch it. Need I say more. #deathtothearmband Although GREAT in concept, the arm band may be the most annoying fitness accessory known to man, but we all still buy it because it was the only thing on the market that alleviates having to carry our phone in our hand. UNTIL NOW!!                                FROM CONCEPT TO CREATION My brief encounter with the sudden death of my phone, by way of the arm band and the St. John's River, lit something inside of me and an idea was born. Mobility in the palm of our hands. I searched the web and the United States Patent Office for something, ANYTHING similar to the product I so longed for, but came up with nothing. I then did the next best thing. I went to happy hour with a friend of mine and put the concept on paper, we left with this. \n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful Right! Yeah, well...it got the point across. I then immediately filed a patent! Finally after another 2 months of searching I found the right designer to make this design plausible for a manufacturer, this was born. Thanks Adrienne!! \n\n\n\n\n\nHouston we have a product design! After another month of searching the world wide web, 78 emails, 26 phone conversations and 2 site visits later, we found a manufacturer.  Hello Benson!! They took our designs and rendered the first conceptual prototype. TADA!!! \n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we got the \"how to\" down, it was time to make a workable prototype. So this happened... \n\n\n\n\n\n From the backside... \n\n\n\n\n\nI bet you can imagine my excitement when this baby arrived. I got together a few of my friends and we put it to the test. A special thanks to Sonya for demoing the prototype. \nOver the course of two months we have figured out several ways to improve the glove: \nA larger screen area for those hard to reach corners \nMore stitching on the inseam of the pouch to keep it from ripping. \nRemoving the padding from the palm and using grip strips instead \nAdding holes in the palm for air ventilation \nCreated a custom companion bluetooth headset \nLastly, sexying this thing up for public consumption \n Which leads us to the final product design. This is what the final glove will look like. With your pledges we will be able to pay for glove moldings and place the minimum order required by the manufacture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Introducing the BMJ Exclusive... \n\n\n\n\n\n...and the Kickstarter Bluetooth companion. \n\n\n\n\n\nWith your pledges we can place the required minimum order to bring Mobile Grip Gear to life! Thank you again for your support! Risks and challenges The risks and challenges involved with producing the Mobile Grip Gear™ Gloves mainly focus around manufacturing on a large scale in a timely manner. To combat this, I have built a strong relationship with my manufacturer Benson (he has the coolest name right) over the past 6 months and after completing several prototypes and a finished design, we strongly believe we will be able to tackle any setbacks that may arise. The manufacturer specifically specializes in glove production on a large scale. It is extremely important to me that we can deliver the highest quality product in the shortest time possible.\n\nWe will be monitoring this project daily while being in contact with our manufacturer to prepare orders a head of time if we are fortunate enough to reach our goal. If we reach a substantial number of gloves we will be flying to the manufacturer and staying on site until the orders are fulfilled. Thank you again for checking out the Mobile Grip Gear™ Gloves, we couldn't do this without you!\n\nHelp us by sharing this with your friends and spreading the word!

    "textDescription": "Story In an arid badlands, squeezed between mighty empires, your people hunger. Your neighbors have grain, cattle, gold. You have horses and spears, courage and ambition. Together with those you love and hate, you will remake history—or die.\nHillfolk , the new game of Iron Age conflict from acclaimed designer Robin D. Laws, introduces to the roleplaying world his DramaSystem rules engine. \nYou know those magical game sessions where the dice and rules fall away, and the entire group spontaneously enters a collective zone of pure story and character? DramaSystem’s basic structure reproduces that dynamic on demand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDramaSystem’s key dynamic is based on the way character interplay occurs in fiction, movies, theater and television. It gives you the all the foundation you need to collectively weave rich, extended narratives. Then it gets out of your way.  You may recognize its driving insights from Robin’s Hamlet’s Hit Points . If that book is the theory, DramaSystem is the practice.  Hillfolk will be published in various editions, available through the pledge levels in the right-hand column, by Pelgrane Press . The physical product will live up to the reputation for excellence established by such games as Trail of Cthulhu , Ashen Stars , and Night’s Black Agents . \n\n\nLayout Rough: Spread with illustration \n \n\n \n\nThe game is designed, written, playtested, and ready to go. All we need to get it over the finish line and into your hands are funds for art, layout and printing.\nJan Pospisil supplies stunning interior illustrations, samples of which are shown here. We’re thrilled by his mastery both of the ancient period and of the humanity of his character portrayals. Christian Knutsson brings his incisive eye to the graphic presentation, with elegant, functional design that matches DramaSystem’s versatile simplicity. Christian served as art director/designer for Operation: Fallen Reich .  The book's physical specs are changing as we upgrade cover treatment and add new pages with each successful series pitch stretch goal (below.)

Blood on the Snow: A DramaSystem Companion Having run out of room in the main book, and with tons of great material waiting in the wings from an array of gaming luminaries, we have added a new item to the reward level mix: a sourcebook called Blood on the Snow: A DramaSystem Companion . We announced this book midway through the campaign, when backers made it possible.

This sourcebook expands the horizons of DramaSystem with troubleshooting, design notes, and a touch of LARP, plus additional Series Pitches from designer Robin D. Laws and an array of design stalwarts established and emerging. Just as we've reached its maximum page count, we've hit the max character count for a KS page.

Risks and challenges The game text is already a complete, post-playtest draft, pending only the inclusion of any additional material created as pledge benefits or stretch goals. Adding additional collaborators to any project introduces the sorts of scheduling uncertainties that Pelgrane Press is accustomed to and takes in stride. The worst-case scenario: modest slippage in release date and order fulfillment.\n\nThere is always a risk when printing a book, but Pelgrane Press has a long-standing relationship with our selected print-partner, and in the very unlikely event of a reprint being required, that would be within the budget.

    "textDescription": "Story Update: The shoot is complete; the images are fantastic! This is an amazing model. The files are ready for download shortly after the campaign ends. The very large images that come out of my Nikon D3 are 12 Mega-pixel and Mamiya/Aptus are 22MP. Alexis will be flying to historic Charleston SC, for a two day marathon of nude photography. We have a number of shoot locations lined up in and around Charleston including studio and location settings. The main theme of the shooting is figure studies, and it will also include commentary by Alexis and behind-the-scenes video. Because Alexis is from the UK, I will have her posing with a restored classic British MG convertible car. I also have access to a gritty industrial building and we will shoot in my studio. And of course we will shoot on the beach! (Yes it's possible here in December!) Funds raised will defray travel costs, a bonus for the model, supplies, and help with the cost of getting to and from each shoot location. We may also be able to extend our shooting time with enough funds. First Time Working Together! Two months ago, Alexis and I had never spoken to each other. Blown away by each other's work, both Alexis and I see this as an opportunity to combine her natural beauty and talent with my unique artistic style and produce something beyond what either of us has done before. In short, exactly what both of us were looking for. Soon, she will be presenting her amazing face to my camera for the first time. The Model Born in a small town in England, Alexis is 5'10\" and has modeled for local artists in the UK, Europe, then South Africa. Built for art modeling, her stats are a natural 32DD-24-34, dress size 2. She has no artificial anything, no tattoos, long brunette hair, and blazing blue eyes.  Beyond her physical perfection, Alexis has instincts for interesting poses and an undying commitment to quality. She is unpretentious and impressive in every way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis hard working, dedicated beauty brings success to any project. Alexis has posed for a series of anonymous nudes, which can be seen in her portfolio here . (Images we do will not be anonymous.) The Schedule Alexis flew in on the morning of Dec 18. She toured downtown Charleston, taking in an art gallery, and the sites; then an historic plantation garden. The rest of the day she prepared for the upcoming shoots. Dec 19 we shot at two locations, an old Navy building and the beach. Dec 20 we shot in an auto shop as well as my studio. Alexis left by train Dec 21. What a great way to travel! I have selected the images and created eight rewards packages. They will be hosted online. Download codes should all be emailed by January 31. You will have 60 days to complete your downloads. Physical items will be sent out in February and arrive before February 28. Autographed items may take two to four additional weeks. Rewards Hi-Res Digital Images A collection of high resolution images of Alexis in all her glory. Most of these images (90% or more) will be fully nude, and rounded out with some casual and behind the scenes shots. There are 8 Image packages as follows: 12 image: set of high-res (2000x3000 pixel) images. \n\n\nFirst 12 images \n \n\n \n\n\n30 images: Above, plus set of 18 (2000x3000 pixel) images. 50 images: Above, plus 20 (2400x3600 pixel) images. 100 images: Above, plus 50 full-resolution (2832x4256 pixel)12MP images from Nikon D3 camera. 200 images: Above, plus 50 additional 12MP images and 50  full resolution 22MP images (4000x5336 pixels) from Mamiya/Aptus Leaf camera. 300 images: Above plus 100 image mega set, 12MP to 22MP. 450 images: Above plus additional 150 image set, 12MP to 22MP.

Art print 20-inches (50cm), signed by Alexis and A K Nicholas. Measures 13x20 inches or 16x20 depending on image. Choice of beach, car, studio, or abandoned building. HD Video Interview and Commentary There will also be a behind-the-scenes HD video with an interview and commentary from Alexis and A K Nicholas that takes you inside the workings of this photo shoot. It will introduce each modeling session and show the nude posing process in action. There will be a short (10 minute). medium (20 minute), and long (30+ minutes) version, depending on reward level.

Risks and challenges Both Alexis and I have lots of experience. She has traveled throughout Europe modeling and has proven herself to be professional and reliable. I have been photographing figure models for a couple of decades. Even if planes are delayed or bad weather crops up, we are determined to make these shoots happen. We have a backup plan of shooting a few hours south of us if necessary. The workload is well within my abilities and I always build extra time into the schedule.\n\nThe shoots are done! Nine reward packages have been uploaded to a secure server waiting to be delivered very soon after the campaign ends. They are hosted on Amazon S3 which has tons of bandwidth for download.

    "textDescription": "Story Update:  Thank you for helping to reach the initial goal within hours! The new goal is to have 200 copies of The Melangui in circulation from this campaign (a $4,500 goal). Also, for every $100 raised above $1,500, I will donate a copy to a school classroom or library here in South Carolina. - - - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn looking for children's books about anxiety or depression, I've encountered many literal depictions of tearful faces and blankets held up over worried chins.  As a nervous and angsty child, I don't recall looking like the kids in these books.  What I do remember is the sense of internal distress and the feeling of holding something complicated inside.  As an adult, I have worked to channel this full range of bodily emotional experience into my drawing practice. The Melangui is a gentle, abstract, exploration of the darker feelings we all experience.  It raises possibilities for how positive thoughts and actions may transform periods of melancholy into lighter and more spacious times.  The Melangui carries our darkness, yet can also be remade into a creature that is balanced between light and shadow, between color and its lack.  The book is intended for adults and pre-teens alike. I have created all the ink drawings and text for a 56-page full-color photo-quality art book that takes a reader through the cycle of moving from darker to lighter mental states, as experienced through the abstract figure of the Melangui.  I'm currently editing the book design into its final, print-ready, format. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book begins with images that speak to elements of darker moods: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt transitions into ways to think about countering these states with positive actions.  The hope is to not be didactic, but to raise ideas of how different kinds of engagement - bodily movement, creative action, reaching out to friends - can lead to lighter and more hopeful thoughts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will create a limited run of hard and softcover photo-quality books through Lulu.  I've printed a softcover proof copy to help with design edits. The color quality is excellent, with thick pages and a durable cover. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I'm also making an art-quality print series of three of the transformed Melangui featured above. Original drawings from the book are available to supporters as well.  My goal is to take the momentum of this initial print run into larger distribution through a trade edition in times to come. Just know, for sure, that you are loved and you are smart. You are good and you are important. You are alive and feeling, thinking and acting, and that is what being in this world is all about. Thank you for your support, in all its forms, for this project and its future. . . . If you would like to read the full text, please send me a message - I'm happy to send it your way. Risks and challenges Given that this is a work in progress, timelines may shift, but I anticipate having the book ready to print in early September. From there, the books and artwork will be printed and distributed by late September or early October, depending on the printer's turnaround time.\n\nAll material copyrighted, Sara Schneckloth, 2015 Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story About The Pane in Empty Rooms I'm Brett Simison, a photographer based in Vergennes, Vermont. Just up in the Green Mountains from me is the remote mountain cabin where Robert Frost lived while teaching at the summertime Breadloaf Writer's Conference from 1940 until his death in 1963. I was looking for a project to work on between assignments and a friend of mine suggested I visit the cabin and make some photographs. What I knew of Robert Frost came from my high school and college literature classes, but after a few visits, I decided to dive deeper and read everything I could get my hands on. Very soon, I learned that there was more to the man besides the glimpses I saw in his well known poems \"Mending Wall\" and the \"The Road Not Taken\". There was a feeling of darkness and loneliness, and I began to see the cabin, the farm grounds, and the surrounding lands of the Breadloaf Wilderness in a new light. It made me wonder why he sought out the solitude of this remote cabin and spent so much time there. What began as a way for me to kill time between assignments ended up as my very succinct visual impression of the man and his adopted environment.  I spent portions of 2010-2012 visiting and photographing the cabin and the surrounding lands of the Breadloaf Wilderness, looking for areas that Frost may have visited and scenes that evoke imagery from his poetry. Middlebury College, who owns and maintains the cabin and Homer Noble Farm in Ripton, Vermont, published the portfolio (as well as other images I made of their Breadloaf Campus) in their 2013 engagement calendar.  I shot this portfolio entirely with film using medium and large format cameras. I love the look of real black and white film. There's a depth and tonality that is very difficult to achieve with digital capture. Plus, it's really hard to beat the amount of image information contained in a well-exposed and developed large format film negative. The photographs are packed with a level of detail and texture that can only be appreciated when printed large. And that's what this Kickstarter project is about: I want to create an exhibition of this work as a series of large 24\"x30\" prints. I want the viewers to be immersed in the images, to be visually transported to Ripton and see the grain of the wood on the cabin walls, the snow clinging to far away trees, and the satin-smooth surface of water on the Middlebury River.  Budget Printing large photographs is expensive and requires a substantial investment in equipment and materials. The budget for this project includes the cost of a large format professional inkjet printer, a full set of replacement inks, rolls of exhibition quality photographic paper, and materials for mounting and hanging the finished prints.  Exhibition Opening The exhibition is scheduled to open at the Vermont Center for Photography in Brattleboro, Vermont in January of 2014. After that, I'm hoping to move the exhibit to several other venues in and out of New England.\n \n\n\n5x7 Exhibition Card \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nClick the images above to view the gallery to choose your reward image \n \n\n \n\n  Risks and challenges I am an accomplished printer and have been printing my own fine art quality prints for several years. I have a small office and have only ever budgeted for a 17\" wide carriage printer, as anything larger requires not only more floorspace but is quite expensive to operate on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe only possible challenges I foresee are managing the production of many large prints in my small home office setup. Handling large prints is difficult -- it's very easy to overwhelm a typical office space with stacks of large prints, and every little mistake that results in dinged edges or corners will stand out. If things get out of hand, I will temporarily commandeer our guest room to accommodate the overflow. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story To create the \"My Country\" video, tUnE-yArDs had immense help from the San Francisco Rock Project , a nonprofit music school that offers musical education to kids through the experience of learning and performing rock music. \nMany of the kids you see in the video are Rock Project kids: they've taken private lessons in electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, keyboards and vocals from working musicians, they've rehearsed in bands made up of kids of all ages, and they've learned the art of performance through regular live, public shows in legitimate music venues.  They learn the basics through performing rock music, and as a result, they develop into original, confident, inspired musicians. And we have been very inspired by them.We could not have made this video without SF Rock Project's generous donation of time, rehearsal space, instruments, and energy.  We want to give back, and there is a very specific way we can: SF Rock Project would like to start a \"lending library\" of instruments to offer students.  If our Kickstarter campaign succeeds, they will be able to reach even more young people with their unique form of music education. The school will use the funds to purchase guitars, bass guitars, ukuleles, percussion instruments, a keyboard, and more to be used in the SF Rock Project LIVE SHOW this summer, which will be a celebration of this campaign! These guys have made this happen before: Rock Project got its start in 2010 through a Kickstarter campaign that helped purchase the initial music equipment needed to get the program off the ground.  Now, the number of students has grown, and consequently, the need for new instruments and other equipment.We are thrilled to be able to give back to an arts program like San Francisco Rock Project, particularly at a time when arts education in public schools is being gutted.  Please help us support kids who love rock!Your donation is also tax-deductible.

(Now with the brand new issue three) \n\n\nWidow's Web #3 Exclusive Cover C (350) by Eric \"Ebas\" Basauldua and Nei Ruffino \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nWidow's Web #1A by Nei Ruffino \n \n\n \n\n\nSet in a world that is not our own, the story follows Dahlia White, an unassuming bartender living in the strange yet familiar Tcesni City, where she attempts to balance her normal -- and sometimes not so normal -- life with the horrifying secret of who and what she really is. A balance that is thrown into absolute chaos when a down-on-his-luck, Pterra Atrus, walks through her door, turning her already crazy world upside down. A world where not everything is what it seems and a new breed of horror awaits. Once you enter the Widow’s Web, there is no escape. \n\n\nWidow's Web #3 Exclusive Cover D (250) by Eric \"Ebas\" Basauldua and Nei Ruffino \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nWidow's Web #1B by Mike Krome and Ula Mos \n \n\n \n\n\n \"Widow's Web takes you down a path that is simultaneously familiar and alien; it's full of experiences, characters and conversations we've all witnessed, as well as those we pray we never will. Gregory, Ivy and the rest of the creative team have woven their own web that will lure you in and never let you go.” - Drunk on Comics \"The realm of horror is a well-mined landscape filled with werewolves, vampires, ghosts and zombies, but somehow Gregory and Ivy have managed to find a new and terrible thing lurking in the deepest darkest shadows. A new kind of monster and a new breed of horror you don't want to miss!\" - It came from Below \"Grade A+ Nothing short of brilliant all the way around. Put it at the top of your pull list!

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP Our plan is to produce the full WIDOW’S WEB series before releasing the book nationally through a publisher. This way, you, the reader, get the very best story we are capable of producing, on time and on schedule, without the need to rush or compromise the quality or integrity of the book itself. We already have the first three issues completely done and the last three issues of the series penciled and lettered, and so far it is everything we could have dreamed of and more. Unfortunately, this also means there is a much longer time to wait before the book is able to begin recouping its production costs and baby, making comics aint cheap. That’s where kickstarter and YOU come in. To help offset these costs, we’re raising money by producing an early release edition of WIDOW’S WEB #1, WIDOW’S WEB #2 and WIDOW'S WEB#3 all 32 full color pages, with issue one featuring over 25 pages of story as well as cool extras and bonus features just for the KICKSTARTER. Anything we raise past our goal will go toward the printing and production (as well as taxes, kickstarter fees, shipping, etc) costs of future issues of the series. But we can only do this with YOUR support. In return, you’ll have the chance to get a first look at this exciting new series before anyone else, as well as the opportunity to grab some of the most bad ass rewards and exclusives you’ve ever laid your eyes on by some of the best artists in comics today. And that's not all.  As a special treat just for the kickstarter event we're releasing a special black and white digital version of the last three issues of the series so you'll have the chance to read the whole story from beginning to end. \n\n\nWidow's Web #3 Kickstarter Incentive Cover F (50) by Eric \"Ebas\" Basauldua and Nei Ruffino (Platinum tier) \n \n\n \n\n\nSo pledge, share on Facebook, tell your family, friends and followers, let Santa know what you really want for Christmas, get your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend/hubby/pet that certain something special, pawn your jewelry and small children, sacrifice a virgin to the dark lords, or tweet if that’s your thing. Every little bit helps. Now go get a sneak peek at the beautiful covers, amazing interior artwork, as well as the incredible rewards being offered below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(See more than one reward that you like?

Our printer is local so all they are waiting for is the green light and we are good to go. Now there is always the possibility of unforeseen issues arising. Be they printing, manufacturing delays, mishaps with shipping, or good old fashion human error. But if any problems do arise we are confident that we will be able to handle them in an efficient and expeditious manner to insure your 100% satisfaction. Our #1 goal is providing you with the best comic stories on the stands today and, with your help, we can make that goal a reality. We're in this for the long haul and see crowd funding as a big part of the future of independent publishing. We appreciate your support and want you back for many more projects in the future, so you have our word we won’t let you down.\n\nAnd having heard some of the horror stories about shipping issues…a small reminder. Please remember that there will be a “survey” sent out once we are funded that you NEED TO FILL OUT in order to receive your items. Kickstarter does not supply us with your address so this is very important. Also, if you email us please be sure to let us know what your backer name is on kickstarter so that we can better serve you. Thanks.

    "textDescription": "Story Recording Artist Drew DeRieux has been working with producer/engineer Wesley Seidman at Ocean Way, now United, for two years condensing down several past projects into newly recorded EPs in the vein of Foo Fighters, Sound Garden with a touch of Alice in Chains and Faith No More. The overall musical idea is to have the iconic sound of 90s rock with a contemporary feel. He's accomplished this by having almost pop-like vocal/melodies and not being afraid to add synths when needed over his powerful and driving chord changes. \"Stories for your ears to see,\" was the theme used to choose what songs to use for each EP along with the overall feel. For Drew, the lyrics had to tell a story. While the music developed, the songs ideas grew more grand and while the tone leans a little towards the dark, there is redemption lurking in the choruses.This album features rock icons Joe Sirois of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones on drums and Chris Chaney of Jane's Addiction on bass, who themselves were part of the sound that developed during the 90s. \"I was ecstatic when I learned that both of these guys would be playing on my albums,\" says Drew, \"and I was doubly so after we tracked them. Their performances truly elevated this production to a level most people never get to work with. We got a sound that I think is unmatched and I can't wait for the world to hear it.\"The first EP \"Amongst You\" is poised to be released early this year. We just need this final financial push to get it into the right hands for mastering! Risks and challenges As the album is already recorded, the only risk I foresee is amazing music being let loose onto the unsuspecting world! Once the mastering for digital release is complete the only step is literally delivering the files to a firm (already selected) who has a relationship with iTunes and other digital distributors.

I couldn't have done this without their guidance and advice. http://www.lordzsezseworks.com Dave Graffam from Dave Graffam Models who so generously offered his work and gave me great insights into his process. His work raises the bar for texture, structure and quality. http://www.davesgames.net The friendly and fun people from Gifted Visions, creators of the Dungeon Crawlers Card Game. http://www.dungeoncrawler.com/index.html The cast and crew from Cardboard Warriors have put up with my rantings for far too long and now they have rallied to support me in this endeavour. Thanks guys!   http://cardboard-warriors.proboards.com That leads us to One Monk Miniatures and Eric Squirmydad Brown who runs the Cardboard Warriors site and make and sell some really amazing paper miniatures. http://www.onemonk.com/Home.html David Wears from Grey Matter Games who makes playful and inventive paper minis and games and can do anything with a sharpie. http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/browse.php?manufacturers_id=4587 Glenn Williams from Finger and Toe Models who makes really playable pieces with an eye on authenticity. http://fingerandtoe.com Kevin Richard John Berry of Kev's Lounge makes simply amazing card stock terrain and figures.

It's important to support independent game development!  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atanastudios/terran-the-simple-portable-resource-trading-board \n\n\n\n\n\n Risks and challenges The best laid plans of mice and men can be thwarted by unexpected events that might delay the production of Darkfast Dungeons, but the time allotted is well within a comfort zone similar to what was used with previous releases such as Snowball Wars and the Ennie-nominated Katana Schoolgirls vs Zombie Furries and both of those games were released with time to spare. \nEvery effort will be made to overcome any setbacks in delivering the base game and all of the add-ons and unlocked stretch goals. Some stretch goals may have extended deadlines if the project increases in size. \nThe game itself has been in existence in one way or another since the early 90s so there has been quite a bit of play testing. There are some rules clarifications that need work and layout, but otherwise the game itself is totally fleshed out. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

We are currently building our retail space at our production facility, and will be using a good amount of our funds to complete an amazing experience for our customers. We will be stocking the shelves with not just our products, but with other local and small batch products from around the US. We are excited to support these businesses, while offering some of the most high quality, delicious products on the market! We're also purchasing a walk-in cooler that will allow us to produce refrigerator pickles for restaurants and supermarkets in the Northern California region. We will be able to increase our production to supply the orders that we are already receiving, and to take on new accounts to grow our business. We are now in over 100 locations in Northern California, but we are expanding quickly! Currently we only have our products in Northern California and online. By the end of this Kickstarter campaign, our bloody mix will also be available in Southern California. By the end of the year, we hope to have products available in Oregon, Washington, Arizona, and Colorado. We are always on the hunt for new distributors, and have goals for national distribution within 3 years! We have been very busy since our first Kickstarter campaign! Our last campaign successfully funded in February, 2013. We have since completed 80% of our construction, and are in the final stages to getting moved in. \n\n\nDrywall in the Retail room. \n \n\n \n We have also increased our product line to over 15 products! We are always looking to create new exciting products to for our customers. We aim to partner with local farmers and companies when we create our products. We always prefer local produce, and partner with local farmers to ensure we can bring the best to our customers. Northern California is thriving with local produce and products. We also have been able to help farmers use produce before the freeze, when they would normally experience crop loss, and loss of income. We love talking about food preservation, and are excited to offer classes in our new facility! We will be offering classes at least twice per month at our facility in Sacramento. Local chefs will also be able to use the production space to teach about their specialties including: knife skills, butchery, sushi, pasta, southern cooking, etc. We thank you so much for your interest and support of our company. For those of you in the Sacramento area, or if you are visiting our area, please feel free to stop by any time to chat! Risks and challenges We learned from our last Kickstarter campaign! Shipping heavy glass products is a very difficult task, but we now have custom boxes to minimize that risk! Sourcing local produce can present some issues from time to time, so we are working hard to anticipate harvests, and create products are the appropriate times.\n\nWhen there is construction, there is always set backs. While we are finishing construction, we will continue to work in the restaurant that allows us to use their kitchen. Our goal is to open in the beginning of June, and begin producing in our shiny new kitchen!! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

We are so excited to make art for you! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this project about? We’re here to collaborate on a unique art and story book inspired by the journals and \nadventures of many intrepid artists who’ve come before us! Our book will be crammed full of sketches, paintings, and notations from the \nfield, as well as photos, engaging stories, jackal hair, and other artistic \nramblings that will give insight into the mind of the artists as well as share \nthe adventure with you. Check out the mock up of the finished product. \nThis is just to give you an idea of your book. We don’t know exactly what we are \ngoing to see, or do, or eat, yet. Don’t worry, we’ll get lots of good stuff for \nyou! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do artists need to travel? We’re a group of artists who, instead of painting photo-realistic wildlife, make up a lot things.  Many artists do this to some extent, but for the fantasy artist, sometimes an entire herd of dragons needs \nto get drawn and we want them to look real. How the heck can we achieve \nthat? The best way is through lifelong study. We rub our faces in books, \nsmear our eyes over our peers' work, and madly burn through pencil and pen at \nzoos and museums. But even when in the gracious presence of a zoo animal or \nbeholding the mighty bulk of a lion’s skull, we find ourselves searching for \nmore experience, and the very best way is through travel. Travel power \nlevels us. It fills us to the brim with exciting new things and we rocket back \nto our studios TO MAKE THINGS with flames bursting from our hands. Travel and \nexperience makes it personal, and it makes it powerful. In addition to \nthe trip, our group itself is a treasure. It consists of visual artists, writers, and creative types; we resonate off one another. We all have quirky interests in the \nunusual, commonly screaming at moss or losing our minds over a dusty rock. See \nhow that twig lays just so. That’s what we do. We then transform the seemingly \ninane, and merge it with awe inspiring subjects such as the lions and leopards, \nand out comes something unique. We are going to fill our \nsketchbooks and notepads full to bursting with adventures, sketches, notes, and mysterious stains \nthat remind us of this magical time for years to come, as centuries of wildlife \nand fantasy artists before us have done. Here we can join in an adventure that \nwill inform and expand our artistic horizons in a way that few other experiences \nin our lives will. And we invite you to join us on that journey. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the trip? Is it being funded by Kickstarter? Our \ntrip is a multi-week adventure to Botswana and South Africa. It is a small, \nprivate group trip focused on finding and observing wildlife, hopefully without \nfalling into too many pits or rivers in the process (we are easily \nexcited by birds and may lose track of where our feet, or our cars, are going)! We will be \ncamping in the bush with local guides, moving overland across the country to the \nCentral Kalahari desert, the Okavango Delta, Moremi, Savuti, and many other \namazing places where animals abound. The trip is scheduled for April, 2015.\n All \nof the participating artists have already planned and paid for the trip, and \nwill be going whether this Kickstarter campaign is successful or not. Many of us \nhave been saving up for this for many years, and are very excited to go! We are \nhoping to share some of our artwork and adventure in a way that can help buffer \nthe costs just a little bit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the participating artists: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Laura Garabedian grew up surrounded by animals, and her love of them has been translating into paintings for most of her life. She is primarily a watercolorist, but is constantly trying new media and loves experimenting with new styles and techniques in her artwork. Currently living in Colorado, the \nstate she truly loves, she takes the chance to travel whenever possible, loving \nthe ability that this career grants her to enjoy all of the pursuits this world \nhas to offer. When she isn’t painting she tends to be outside, horseback \nriding, rock climbing or \nhiking with her friends and her dog (a llama – afghan cross). These activities help keep her a happy artist, striving to constantly \nexperience anything and everything life throws in her direction.

He is a computer programmer by day, artist by\nnight, and part time bee farmer. \n\n His artwork is\nwhimsical, flavored by the styles of classic Bohemian illustrators and even\nolder European woodcut works.

Roman plans to contribute photography, comics, and random Czech.Extra zebra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Amber \"Vantid\" Hill is an accomplished artist who specializes in fantasy \nwildlife illustration. She is self-taught with a strong background in animal \npainting and anatomy. Amber's interest in the natural world began at an early \nage and inspired a life of drawing and observation. In addition to art, she enjoys organic gardening and permaculture, cooking, \ntravel, animal training, staring at moss, and dreaming of chickens. She \ncurrently resides in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with her dashing husband. Amber plans to contribute anatomical and movement studies, bird sketches, some photography, as well as extensive notes on all the food. http://www.amberhillart.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Ursula Vernon is the author and illustrator of the Eisner-nominated, \nHugo-Award winning graphic novel \"Digger,\" as well as the Dragonbreath \nseries for kids, and the kid's books Nurk and Castle Hangnail.

I have \nlong held a love of Africa's wild places but the most earnest, the longest lived \nof my fascinations lay in the heart of Botswana's wildlands -- from the Okovango \nDelta to the vast grasslands that are the Kalahari Desert.  From my long-lived \nfascination with Africa and its wildlife was born a story called Savuti, about \nan ordinary lioness who was born in the Okovango Delta and is destined to walk \nan extraordinary path. Savuti aims to explore the nature of emotions, morality, \nfree will, and to address that ancient question: The meaning of \nlife.While the basic framework for the story has been forming over the \npast few years, I do not believe this is a story I can justly tell without \nseeing with my own eyes the land in which it is set. Through the incredible \nefforts of some vastly more incredible folks this trip has been made possible \nand more importantly, financially within reach. This trip to Botswana is the \nrealization of a dream that has been been with me for most of my adult life, and \nI invite you to join me on my own journey to discover the beauty of this untamed \nplace as well as the humble beginning of Savuti.\"  Anastasia plans to contribute drawings, stories, and inspiration for her long-term graphic novel project, Savuti!http://balaa.deviantart.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Edwin \"Utunu\" & Jenine \"Kikivuli\" Herrell live in Austin, Texas, which is fortunately not like the rest of Texas.  Since the mythical early 90s, Edwin has been a video game developer, and around that time he met Jenine at the nerdiest of ventures – a roleplaying game.  Jenine has a background in both medicine and publishing, and conveniently shares with Edwin a number of interests, including gaming, African fauna, commissioning artwork, commissioning more artwork, and the Oxford comma.  Both have a love of nature and desire to get more actively involved in the support of various endangered African animals, the African wild dog in particular, and are thrilled about the prospect of actually seeing them in the wild!In his spare time, Edwin dabbles in writing, linguistics (especially African languages), and world-building, and laments his inability to accomplish much in any of them.  In her spare time, Jenine wonders how she got spare time, and often assists in Edwin’s various endeavors. Edwin and Jenine plan to share writing, photography, and hopefully some of their extra, off-in-the-bush adventures on the search for the uncommon, elusive, African Wild Dogs. -Other participants :  We have a total of eleven people embarking on this adventure together, and everyone wants to contribute some of their best, most interesting stories, photographs, or scribbles to its making.

    "textDescription": "Story I'm Jess Thom – artist writer and part time superhero. I've got Tourettes Syndrome, a condition that makes me say ‘biscuit’ 16,000 times a day. My unusual neurology gives  me a unique perspective on life, one I'm happy to share with the rest of the world. Tourettes Syndrome is a neurological condition characterized by involuntary noises and movements called tics. It's one of the most frequently misunderstood conditions on the planet and is widely used as a by-word for excessive swearing (only 10% of people with Tourettes have swearing tics). But there's much more to this mysterious and complex condition. So in 2010 I co-founded Touretteshero , an organization that celebrates the humour and creativity of tics. You can find out more by watching my TEDx Talk . \n\n\n\n\n\nThe response has been incredible and Touretteshero's had some great TV and press coverage over the years. I've been interviewed on Stephen Fry's Planet Word and by Phil and Holly on This Morning . Extracts from my book Welcome to Biscuit Land have featured in the Observer and I've been on Woman's Hour and the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. Through Touretteshero I've come to realise that my tics are my power, not my problem. Now I need your help with a new exciting project. About Backstage In Biscuit Land Backstage in Biscuit Land is a brand new show for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival exploring spontaneity, creativity and disability. Expect ticcing, singing, stand-up, story telling and things you never knew would make you laugh. No two shows can ever be the same, but this will almost certainly be the most biscuity theatre ever. With your help we'll be able to take audiences on a journey through the strange, \nsurreal and magical world of Biscuit Land.  This playful and informative piece will share my personal experience of Tourettes Syndrome and allow \nspace for reflection and audience participation. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Need We've secured a great venue at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival but we need your help to make sure we've got everything we need to do the show justice.  Here's how the money you pledge will be spent: £2500 - Hire of the amazing Pleasance Above £1200 - Accessible accommodation (Edinburgh's full of steep hills and winding staircases – we need to find a place to stay where I can roll in and out in my wheelchair!) £1500 - PR and marketing to make sure everyone knows about our amazing show £400 - Props, costume and puppets to bring Biscuit Land to life £400 - The train fare to get us there (and back) in one piece Project Team Even a superhero needs help and for this mission I'm being supported by and amazing team. They are: Jolie Booth (Producer) Jolie's a cutting edge producer with a passion for making creative and innovative work in a variety of mediums. She secured highly respected industry contracts early on in her career, including six years with world famous fool Jonathan Kay and three years with annual street arts festival the Streets of Brighton. She now works with a portfolio of high-caliber artists and companies that include: Tangram Theatre Company , Glass-Eye Theatre Company , Parrabbola and of course Touretteshero. Jess Mabel Jones (Puppeteer)  Jess has worked extensively as a puppeteer and actress in theatre. Credits include: Improbable’s Beauty and the Beast , Blind Summit’s The Table and projects with the RSC , Little Angel Theatre and The Watermill . Jess is Associate Director of Finger in The Pie and programmer of the prestigious Finger in The Pie Cabaret . Jess has written The Tragic & Regrettable Life of Teofila Teodora de la Lima and numerous street theatre pieces for her old company Woodenfingers . Jess is currently working with Locoq company Rhum & Clay on Hardboiled and her autobiographical show My Name is Rifnur is being developed with the Battersea Arts Centre . Matthew Pountney (Touretteshero co-founder) Matthew's a London based musician and film-maker. He has extensive experience of working with disabled children and young people and he's devised and delivered a range of inclusive creative events at venues such as the South London Gallery , The Ritzy Brixton and Tate Britain . Although diverse in their themes and expression, these events all share the common goal of creating opportunities for participants to be imaginative, inventive and artistically free. Matthew co-founded Touretteshero in 2010 with Jess Thom. Touretteshero Needs You! Backstage in Biscuit Land will challenge the myths and assumptions associated with Tourettes Syndrome. Most importantly it will create a space in which the inventiveness, energy and unpredictability of the condition can be showcased and enjoyed by everyone. Please join me on this important mission to change the world, 'one tic at a time.' Risks and challenges As an organization Touretteshero has a strong track record for creating wide-ranging work and engaging audiences, nationally and internationally. Our website attracts approximately 80,000 unique visitors per year from 186 countries. We've worked with varied creative collaborators and have a wide-ranging portfolio of media interviews, articles, public speaking, campaigning and performances. \n\nBelow are the five key challenges we face on our journey Backstage in Biscuit Land and how we're going to do to meet them. \n\n1.\tCreating the show\n\nWe'll allow sufficient time to develop the show. We'll draw on the experience of established theatre professionals, venues, organizations and mentors. We have a strong project team, an abundance of creativity and a lot of surreal tics. \n\n2.\tMaintaining health of the project team \n\nWe'll all take steps to promote good health and well-being. If necessary we'll make adjustments to workload or distribution of tasks or engage additional help, either on a voluntary or paid basis, as resources allow.\n \n3.\tManaging any unforeseen problems with the venue or logistics \n\nWe already have a great venue in place, the Pleasance Above. We have a clear written agreement with the venue. We'll ensure good communication and thorough planning for all elements of the project and will deal with any problems that emerge quickly. \n\n4.\tSecuring the anticipated audience numbers \n\t\nWe'll promote the project widely and make good use of social media and our established network of Touretteshero supporters. The show we'll create will be unique and engaging so we expect people will want to talk about it and share it. \n\n5.\tManaging the budget and cash flow \n\nWe'll record all income and expenditure carefully and accurately and review all budget areas regularly. This means we can Identify any shortfalls or surpluses and adjust our spending accordingly. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Jacklyn would be raised by Von Drake to be his master assassin and later serve as his lover as well. When Razor, a now adult Nicole Mitchell, began interfering in his operations he dispatched Stryke to bring her to him. It was Jacklyn who first realized that Razor was her older sister. Stryke turned on Von Drake and the two women defeated Von Drake but Nicole, not realizing who Stryke really was, left the younger woman for dead. \n\nThis angered Jacklyn who decided to kill Razor despite their family connection. Jacklyn eventually tracked her sister down and after a grueling fight killed her sister. Razor would be restored to life by her family descendant, Poizon. The three women were needed to stop a resurrected Von Drake. Only by mystically merging together were the trio able to finally destroy Roman Von Drake. A side effect of the merger meshed the three women's psyche's (Stryke became more passive after absorbing some of Nicole's child hood traumas, Nicole became more sexually assertive).

    "textDescription": "Story \nBe-YOU-ty Night: Making Art + Activism, Feminism, and Empowerment Happen.   Being a woman today is a challenge. To be judged by your appearance everywhere you go is to be oppressed by the expectations and gazes of others. It is to see yourself through the eyes of the world at all times. For many women, being comfortable in one's skin is a perpetual struggle. Women stress about their weight, their makeup , their appearance, and the size and shape of their various body parts constantly. For too many young girls and women, this creates a perpetual cycle of self-hate. This is, unfortunately, an all-too-common reality about being a woman today. In a world where airbrushing and fake beauty are idolized, girls and teens can find themselves deeply insecure and body dysmorphic, leading to a cycle of self-hatred and low self-esteem, depression, eating disorders, and sometimes even death/suicide.  As schools promote physical assessments, like the Fitnessgram, which include BMI reports that are not only arbitrary and unreliable but can also lead to body insecurity and bullying, children are trained to compare their bodies to others from their earliest years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Researchers and cultural analysts have tried to tell us - it's just too much: \"For decades advertisers have come up with an “ideal” for the perfect woman. This woman represents what five percent of women look like, yet this body type represents 98% percent of the women seen in the media (Kilbourne).\" \n\"The idea that a woman is never happy with her body has become so accepted that it is rare for one to take the time to understand why that is the case and what is causing it (Kilbourne).\"  \n\"Younger and younger girls are becoming affected by these messages. In a survey of fourth graders 80% of them said they were on a diet (Kilbourne).\"*  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens next? \n As women grow up with obsessive body-dysmorphic ideas about themselves, they pass these ideas onto their children. Women hold themselves back and are held back in the world, due to chronic self-esteem issues, lack of internal self-worth, and unrealistic expectations and pressures beyond their control. And sometimes, eating disorders or other self-harming behaviors manifest. It never ends - unless we push back.  \nBE-YOU-TY NIGHT! is a performance and charity fundraiser event.   Five talented female performers of various backgrounds (like musical theatre, R&B, Soul, Pop, and Opera) will share their journeys of empowerment through music and personal stories. They will get to share who they are in the context of self-love, self esteem, and the beauty they offer the world through performing.  The event will raise money for Endangered Bodies (endangeredbodies.org ), a global non-profit organization taking a stand against the toxic culture that teaches women and girls to hate their bodies through meetings, seminars, counseling, and activism. Now, we are NOT raising charity funds on Kickstarter. We are solely focusing on funding the production cost for  Be-YOU-ty Night!  Any money donated to Endangered Bodies will be raised during the actual event on March 1st, after our Kickstarter campaign has officially ended. What are our goals? 1. Independent artists in the NYC area perform themed works and are paid for their contributions to this event - in a city where too many want artists to work for merely \"exposure,\" this project stands upon the principle that ethical gigs are paid gigs.  2. We plan to raise money for the Endangered Bodies organization during the event on March 1st, and our goal is $2500. 3. We plan to combine the efforts of art, storytelling and activism to advance the cause of body image education, the dismantling of dysfunctional media and educational tools, and to be co-creators of a world where young girls and women can live with body positivity and sensitivity around the messages related to female bodies and self-image. 4. We are also planning to have a raffle at the event for various items that have to do with self care in the spirit of \"treating yourself, NOT fixing yourself\" - personal training, nutrition coaching, books, Zumba classes, and more.  \n\n\"THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL!\" ...  But we cannot do it alone. \n \n\nProducing this project in NYC requires research, rehearsals, organizing, planning, promoting, and money. Our budget, in order to pay for performers/musicians, videographers, publicity, rehearsal space, and performance venue fees is $3000. Your contribution will go directly toward making Be-YOU-ty Night! a special event of art and activism. \n \n\n\nIf we do not reach our funding goal, we don't receive ANY of your pledges. This means that we absolutely must meet our goal and surpass it- so we need you to take us over the top. It's critical that our backers not only pledge their financial support, but also spread the word and make sure to show us some \"link love\" EVERYWHERE you can on social media! Tell your friends, especially those local to New York City and \"join the revolution!\" Together, we can truly make a difference! \n\nGet your tickets for the event at beyoutynight.brownpapertickets.com  ! \n\n\n\n*http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&context=honors  - Hidden Messages: Advertising and the Messages They Send to Society About Women By Alyssa Michaelides  \n Risks and challenges 1. Coordinating schedules with multiple performers and personnel will be difficult. Execution of this step will have to be very organized.\n\n2. Media outreach is a tedious and time-consuming process. With a limited budget and various tools and contacts, we plan to promote the show while organizing the show and working under a tight deadline. We have one month to promote a show and fill a theater with over 100 people. This requires \"boots on the ground\" and careful time management.\n\n3. Our musical arrangements have to be completed in a timely manner and rehearsed in the theater space prior to the show date.\n\n4. We will have to coordinate shipping and fulfillment on our rewards for many backers in a timely and organized manner. We have to do that while organizing and putting the show together. This requires digital organization and planning.\n\n5. We all have lives and jobs and this is a performance project that we're creating in addition to our other commitments.

I am an independent musician about to record my 4th full-length record and I would love to do some things that I've never had the budget to do before like pay for my very first RADIO CAMPAIGN .  In the past, every ounce of funds has gone towards just getting the record made and out. I've just never had the extra money to do some of the things that, really, are important to having a record find a wide listening audience.  As well, many of the musicians and studios I've worked with over the years have given me a lot of time and energy on a dime because they have believed in my music.  But this time, I need to push things farther.  I'm gonna dream a little bigger.   And I can only do this with your help. I have been saving for some of the basic studio costs I have but besides funding a radio campaign I am still in need of what it takes to package and promote this new record to its fullest.  On May 27th,  I fly back to NYC to record once again at The Maid's Room.  I wrote and recorded songs like \"Build You Up\" and \"Lost and Found\" at this studio.  Here is  a recent and really great article about the studio: http://www.sonicscoop.com/2012/05/13/secret-studio-the-maids-room-is-nycs-analog-recording-magnet/   I'll be there for 7 days or so hammering out  15+ songs.  And I'll be posting some updates from the studio here so be on the lookout! My music has been steadily gaining a wider audience over the last couple of years thanks to some terrific TV placements on shows like Flashpoint ,  Smallville and the mini-series Cyberbully.   In support of my first Kickstarter, the producers at Flashpoint have sent over a bunch of signed DVDs that are part of my incentives package!  I have never been on a label. I am a totally independent songwriter who is  completely dependent on YOU . In this campaign, even at the $1 level you will receive a complete digital download of the new record. Even at the smallest contribution,  I want you to walk away with music in your ears.  It's the best way--the only way, really-- I know how to thank you for bringing me along even this far and giving me the chance to make music.  Consider supporting my project and helping me to cast my net even wider.  I am beyond excited about the songs on this new project and I think you will be too.  And also!  In celebration of this Kickstarter campaign I'm releasing my very first music video to my song Days Like This.  The biggest thanks to photographer Michael Wilson and editor Matt Davis for helping me put this together.  Enjoy and please help spread the word!

    "textDescription": "Story DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT Following the maxim that a writer should \"write what she knows,\" I have written Hartwood , a screenplay for a feature-length film that draws on real events in my life. The story at the center of the film is raw, evocative, and, I think, an honest depiction of illness and recovery that is often overlooked in film and literature. As is common in the process of making an independent feature film, we will be filming this project in two segments over the course of a year. This summer, we will shoot and produce a \"short\" film, adapted from an early section of the full screenplay, in which we witness the catalyst that sets the film in motion. This short is an initial step in the process of producing Hartwood as a feature-length film (for which we will begin filming in 2016). My creative team and I plan to submit the short film to festivals and will use it as an example of our work to apply for grants and other sources of funding. Recent projects that have successfully used this model include Whiplash and Short Term 12 . While the project spans two summers, this will be our one and only Kickstarter! Our budget for the short film is $15,000 and will provide us the material we need to raise the remaining budget for the feature (estimated to be $75,000) from grants and private donors. THE STORY \nThe film opens with Maeve, a young actress in New York City, running through the traffic of Times Square to get to an audition. Her life in the city begins to unfold, and we witness her constant hustle: to auditions, to work, to class, and trudging back home at the end of long days. Maeve is wrapped up in the momentum of a fast-paced survival, trying to keep up with the city that never sleeps, and making unsustainable decisions along the way.  She receives a phone call from the hospital in her hometown, informing her that her mother, a pancreatic cancer survivor, has been admitted and is not doing well. Not knowing what to make of the situation, Maeve drops everything. She quits her job, packs her bags, and flies back to tend to her ailing mother. Upon her arrival, things aren't quite as Maeve had expected and she is finally forced to confront the issues that are in front of her. Maeve settles into a slower pace set against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains, but grapples with familial obligation, survival, and what it means to truly live. Hartwood is set in both New York City and Hartwood, Montana. The two locations offer starkly differing styles that parallel the external and internal \"noise\" in the lives of the central characters. Additionally, the complexities of cancer survival and its aftermath play a large role in the development and discovery of these characters' truths. The short film will focus on Maeve's life in New York and her decision to return home. Because this is a personal project, albeit with a fictionalized plot, I'll bring a unique voice to the issues that this story deals with. As a story-teller, it is important to me to relate to audiences through both poignancy and humor. (So, hopefully some laughing!) As a writer and director, it is important to me to have complex female characters. (So, hopefully some Bechdel test-passing!) As a daughter, a sister, and an aunt, it is important to me to honor the intricacies and nuanced ideas of family. (So, hopefully some tough questions!) In combining all of these, I hope to tell an intimate and individual story with immense universal relatability. CREATIVE TEAM \n\n\nwww.miacrivello.com \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nwww.samueldnewman.com \n \n\n \n\n\nWHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO We will not be able to make this project without your support! Your contributions will cover expenses for 5 days of shooting in NYC and Helena, MT. Specifically, the contributions will go toward our Sony FS7 camera equipment, lighting kits, sound design, crew travel and meals, location permits, hair and make-up, color correction, post-production editing, and festival submissions. Any money that is raised beyond the budget for the short film will be used toward filming the feature length film in 2016. All money will be put into the account dedicated to the production company. Risks and challenges As this is my first feature film, I expect it to be a learning process. Luckily, I've surrounded myself with an incredibly knowledgable and talented team! By making the short segment of the film first, I hope to identify areas for improvement before we film the feature next summer. I look forward to encountering bumps in the road and navigating through, around, and over them!\n\nI truly appreciate your support, whatever the size of the contribution. This project is important to me and I look forward to sharing the results with you when it is completed! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Lastly, (and this is the really exciting upgrade) five cards get old school chipback card stock! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the sales pitch is over, let's get to the nitty-gritty. Like most of you reading this, Madman changed my life when it first came out. I discovered Madman Adventures in 1993 and it made me realize that superheroes could be about something more, while indie comics could also have the same level of high-octane adventure as a superhero comic.  It was both heady and fun at the same time. Where the Comin' Atcha set was my having fun, Madman 25! is the most fitting tribute I can think of for this life-changing comic book. I hope to have you along! Risks and challenges The biggest challenges might be logistical: this set is going to come from a few different print resources (due to the varied upgrades). Sometimes cards get hijacked by aliens from space, or even Tri-Eye agents. \n\nOther than that minor possibility, the cards are 95% written and designed already, and will be set for the printer when the Kickstarter funds come in.

There are obligations, decisions to make, bills to pay, and at times, bad luck. Life happens. Passion can get pushed aside, and sometimes it takes a good friend with a fire burning under his ass to make you realize the passion you once had is not lost.  That it's still there smoldering, somewhere under all that \"life.\" My name is Ryan, I clean pools for a living. My friend is Travis, he works in film for a living. Thanks for the ass fire comment, Ryan. Hey, I'm Travis. Last winter, Ryan and I were at an Orlando bar, the Matador, with our friend Ashley, who also works in film. We got to talking about writing something funny, and we wanted to laugh at whatever that something would end up being.  And so, after some beers, and some of Ryan's poolside war stories, we decided to make that something into a TV show about a pool man. Not just any pool man, but like an '80s, National Lampoon's Vacation , MacGuyver -esque redneck kinda dude named Johnny Meksikin, a guy who loves his gig as a pool cleaning technician, and the slow life in this horse-ridin', boat-drivin', gossip-ridden, sweet-tea-drinkin', Bible-thumpin', deer-huntin', mud-boggin', lovely, little, country town of Romance, FL.  The show's title is \"Romancing the Patio\" and it will feel like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Curb Your Enthusiasm  meets King of the Hill, Joe Dirt, and Eastbound and Down. We are asking , along with the cast and crew who are already part of our shoot, for help with funding the remainder of our needs to shoot the pilot episode of our show in Ocala, FL at the end of summer 2012. We've already covered costs in many areas , including: cameras, camera crew, some castmembers, a list of shooting locations, preproduction, writing, casting, travel, lodging, and some production equipment and camera gear. There are still some other things we haven't been able to pay for yet.  And so we're reaching out to ask you for help in creating this funny little show. Your help and donations will pay for : production support rentals  (tables, chairs, trash cans, ladders, 10x10 tents, working lights, copy machine, wardrobe racks), grip equipment, lighting rentals, some cast and crew members, camera support equipment, art department (props, signs, set dressing), wardrobe, make-up, meals, food and water on set, and post-production. After we shoot the pilot episode in Florida, we will be editing the footage in Los Angeles, CA. Post-production takes lot more time than that needed for shooting, and its costs are harder to avoid, but we have a couple amazing editors in Los Angeles already lined up ready to help. We shot this teaser video as a glimpse of what might be seen in an episode of \"Romancing the Patio.\" We hope you laugh at it and donate to help us make this funny dream a reality. There are a bunch of thank you gifts for your donations that we think you'll like.

It is ready for submission to festivals and distributors, and it's time to start the marketing! The movie still needs final color correction, music, sound mixing, creation of a key special effects shot, and the designing and manufacture of marketing and advertising materials. Please watch the video and find out about this hilarious new movie, the innovative new producing/educational model Project 23 , and our goals for the movie's future. We hope to finish The Boys at the Bar as quickly as possible, to screen at a few festivals, and then to open the film in a few key cities, especially Salt Lake City, Utah (the home of Project 23 ) and St. Louis, Missouri (where the movie is set) before distributing the movie EVERYWHERE and in every way possible - theatrically, on DVD and Blu-Ray, Video on Demand, internet download, etc. You'll see that our fundraising goal is $30,000. Because we must reach our minimum to get ANY funds at all through Kickstarter, we've set it low. Our real goal is $100,000.00. That's right. One hundred thousand dollars. That's a lot, we know. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but with your support and with the hard work of the producers of Project 23, we can do it!

Trailer for \"The Boys at the Bar\" \nFILMMAKER MAGAZINE: RICHARD DUTCHER ON PROJECT 23 AND \"THE BOYS AT THE BAR\" by Randy Astle  May 14, 2013 Richard Dutcher is one of the most important and accomplished directors that nobody’s heard of. Like many independent filmmakers, Dutcher is a multihyphenate: writer, director, actor, producer, editor. In the process he’s created eight feature films that span genres and styles, including romantic comedy (Girl Crazy), intense emotional drama (States of Grace), gritty gut-wrenching naturalism (Falling), supernatural horror (Evil Angel), elegant formalism (Tryptich), and even a passionate period piece with only one actress (Eliza and I). And since his 2000 film God’s Army he’s become something like the Robert Rodriguez of Utah: the most important filmmaker in a region with a fast-developing indie community. Although the state includes both Sundance and Slamdance in the north and John Ford country in the south, it wasn’t until God’s Army that a multitude of local filmmakers felt ownership for the local film scene and were galvanized to make films, found production companies, run new film festivals, and create a small but robust industry. Hence Dave Boyle, Jared and Jerusha Hess, Ryan Little, Christian Vuissa, Jared Cardon, and a host of others. So it shouldn’t be any surprise that with his newest project The Boys at the Bar Dutcher’s added another job description to his resume: teacher. He had been informally mentoring filmmakers, enough that in 2011 it made sense to organize a more formal effort in the shape of a guerrilla film school that would produce a single feature film from concept to distribution. “I just put the word out on Facebook,” he says. “And I always said that if I could find 20 students that were willing to do it then I would do it. And I really didn’t think I would. So I was surprised when, at the end, I had 23 people that wanted to do it. So we just organized and started the journey.” Dubbing themselves Project 23, the group started meeting at night in November 2011 in a law office in Salt Lake City. They began developing a new concept by Dutcher, a comedy that takes place in a single night in an Irish pub in St. Louis. Dutcher describes The Boys at the Bar as “an experimental, ‘conflict-free’ comedy. It’s a kind of celebration of American humor.” The students were put to work organizing preproduction and raising the $150,000 production budget. Actual shooting took place in May 2012, with cinematographer Bill Butler (Jaws, The Conversation, Grease; seen with Dutcher above). With a single location and semi-improvised script, production only lasted a week, and for the past year Dutcher has been guiding his students through the postproduction process. Because of the ubiquity of crowdfunding, part of that process now includes running a Kickstarter campaign for finishing funds that’s now in its final week. To show his dedication to the film, Dutcher launched a 12-day water fast on April 28 (culminating on “the worst birthday of [his] life”); his daily YouTube updates have become as much a part of The Boys at the Bar‘s story as the film itself (never has an actor relished a slice of watermelon more than Dutcher does in his last post). Health concerns required him to eat before the Kickstarter campaign came to an end, but the Project 23 team is still pushing hard to reach their $30,000 goal. The film is therefore not finished yet, but can Project 23 be seen as a successful new model for film education and mentorship? “It’s an unqualified success in my mind,” Dutcher says. “Those that [stuck with it] learned how to make an independent film–and did make an independent film.” That underscores the greatest difficulty of the process for Dutcher as a mentor: “The hardest part was keeping some of them motivated. A few of them really didn’t understand the work of a film producer. They thought it would be all glamour and excitement. So when they saw how much hard work, personal risk, and thankless effort they would have to put in… a few of them lost enthusiasm.” Such a response among 23 participants is not unexpected, of course, and Dutcher says he would do it again if possible. “What I would be incredibly pleased to see is if this story got out there, if someone like Paul Schrader started taking 20 new filmmakers through this process. Or Hal Hartley, or whoever some of the guys are from my generation who stopped making movies. That, to me, would be the icing on the cake. It’s this wonderful, beautiful hybrid–an economic and educational model–and I would like to see it catch on.” He adds the caveat, however, that it should only catch on as long as it remains viable, and with the speed of change in today’s industry that window might not last long. “It might not work two years from now, but then you come up with something else.” For the time being, Dutcher’s managed to create a feature film, nearly two dozen film producers who can now grow the indie film industry in Utah and elsewhere, and a model for others to follow in other regional centers. At a time when the unsustainability of filmmaking tops Ted Hope’s list of film career hazards, this potential should not be discounted. If we can see similar mentoring arrangements spring up in San Francisco, New Orleans, Austin, Portland, Toronto, or Minneapolis, this new economic and educational model might just spark a small but important paradigm shift throughout indie film. Richard Dutcher: Sharing his Passion and Talents to Help Aspiring Filmmakers \n\n\nFilmmaker Richard Dutcher (right) with cinematographer Bill Butler and camera operator Sohrab Mirmontazeri (left) on the set of \"The Boys at the Bar.\" \n \n\n \n\nMay 2, 2013 - The Entertainment Journal For almost two decades, Richard Dutcher has been the writer, producer and director of some of the most highly-acclaimed independent films in the industry. He’s learned the ins and outs of what it takes to get a product completed and into the marketplace. Starting with “God’s Army,” and continuing with films like “Brigham City,” “States of Grace,” “Falling” and “Evil Angel,” Dutcher has raised the bar and set the standard for independent films he’s taken from start to finish. His latest project is, in many ways, his most aggressive yet. It’s also potentially a game-changer for him, and many of the crew members who worked on it as a labor of love last summer. With “The Boys at the Bar,” he created an opportunity for 23 aspiring producers to learn every aspect of the filmmaking process. It was a dream and a goal of his for several years. “I was just really examining the way that independent filmmaking has changed so rapidly over the past five years,” Dutcher says. “My films were starting to get bigger and more expensive, but then the economics just dropped out of independent film.” It led him to thinking about making his next film on a shoestring budget, “because I’m a filmmaker and that’s always been my attitude. Filmmakers make films; with whatever you’ve got, you do whatever you can.” Dutcher wrote the screenplay for “The Boys at the Bar,” set in St. Louis but filmed “after hours” at the Poundcakes restaurant in Salt Lake City’s Trolley Square. The film follows a group of friends as they joke, drink and celebrate the birthday of one of their own at their local Irish pub. Then he came up with how to make it—he founded his own guerilla film school where aspiring producers could work completely hands-on through the whole process. He just needed to find those “guerillas.” “So I just put the word out on Facebook,” Dutcher says. “And I always said that if I could find 20 students that were willing to do it, then I would do it. I really didn't think I would. So I was surprised when, at the end, I had 23 people that wanted to do it. We just organized and started the journey.” A few weeks later, in November 2011, they met for the first time in a law office in Salt Lake City. They called themselves Project 23. Their goal was to raise $150,000 for initial production costs, a goal they met in less than 90 days. Dutcher immersed them in every facet of the process—key crew positions on set, creation of a plan for marketing and distribution, and particularly the fundraising. “I told them that if you want to be a producer, you have to learn to raise money.” His reputation within the industry helped land legendary cinematographer Bill Butler to the digital production (Dutcher’s first digital effort). Butler’s credits include “One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” “Jaws,” “Grease” and “The Conversation.” Veteran actor Bo Hopkins came on board for one of the lead roles, as did actress Scarlett Keegan. Other veteran crew and cast members added their expertise and guided the student crew as the film began shooting right on schedule, in May of 2012. The film is set in one location, was shot in the course of a single week and includes a full 25 minutes of improvised material. “By the end of filming,” Dutcher says with pride, “these students were no longer students—they were film producers.” There remains one last challenge, however, before “The Boys at the Bar” can go to market. And it’s another example of Dutcher’s passion for his craft in general, and this film in particular. He has begun a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign with a goal of raising $30,000 to complete the movie. “It needs color correcting, sound editing and mixing; a score, music rights to purchase, a key special effects shot to be created, and graphics work,” he says. “Candidly, we need more than $30,000, but that’s the goal I’ve set to raise to finish the film.” He has to raise the money by May 19, or none of what has been pledged towards that goal will be realized. On April 28, Dutcher started a 21-day fast (running through the Kickstarter deadline date), where he will consume water-only until the goal is met. He has no illusions that the heavens will open up and pour money down for the project due to his fast. “My only reasons for the fast are to draw attention to this project, and to help me focus completely on the fundraising efforts,” he says.” As far as Project 23 is concerned, it's an unqualified success in his mind. “Those that [stuck with the class] learned how to make an independent film and did make an independent film,” he says. While Dutcher is proud of the film and proud of his students' educations, he also hopes that Project 23 won't stop here. “What I would be incredibly pleased to see, if this story got out there, is someone like Paul Schrader taking 20 new filmmakers through this process. Or Hal Hartley, or whoever some of the guys are from my generation who stopped making movies. That, to me, would be the icing on the cake. It's this wonderful, beautiful hybrid--an economic and educational model, and I would like to see catch on.” To contribute to Dutcher’s efforts, visit the Kickstarter website and make a pledge by May 19. A number of gift packages are available for those who contribute to this effort. \n\n\nFilmmaker Richard Dutcher with the producers of Project 23 shortly before filming their movie \"The Boys at the Bar.\" \n \n\n \n\nFilmmaker Richard Dutcher Starves for His Movie Art BY SEAN P. MEANSTHE SALT LAKE TRIBUNEPUBLISHED: MAY 9, 2013  \n\n\nCourtesy of Audrey Rock. Filmmaker Richard Dutcher, photographed relaxing in front of his Utah County home on May 4, Day 6 of a three-week water-only fast. \n \n\n \n\nRichard Dutcher is taking the whole “starving artist” idea to a new level. “I’m hungry as hell,” the Provo-based filmmaker said Wednesday, during the 10th day of a planned three-week “hunger strike” he launched to focus on — and rally people behind — his campaign to raise finishing funds for his latest movie. “It’s no fun,” said Dutcher, 48. “I don’t recommend you ever do this.” Since ceremonially eating two orange sections on April 28, Dutcher has consumed nothing but water. He has dropped 19 pounds and lost 2 inches off his belly. He has chronicled his fast in daily dispatches on YouTube. After 10 days without food, Dutcher said, “sometimes you feel surprisingly well and energetic. And other times you feel like lying down and dying.” Dutcher’s girlfriend, Audrey Rock, was skeptical at first. “I didn’t really think he was going to do it,” said the writer and former movie critic. “But I had no objections. I said, ‘I’m right behind you. Let’s do it.’  “It didn’t get frightening to me until he started to get sick,” she said. That was on Day 8, Monday, when Dutcher started vomiting. Rock tended to Dutcher, putting wet cloths on his forehead and helping him rest. “My life right now is revolving around this fast,” Rock said. Dutcher went on a fast 13 years ago before filming his breakout film, the Mormon missionary drama “God’s Army.” He did it then, in part, because the character he played in the film, an older LDS missionary with a terminal illness, needed to be thinner. The previous experience “inspired me to think that if I can do it for eight days, maybe I can do it for longer,” Dutcher said. The current fast, he said, has a different goal: Get pledges for $30,000 on the Internet fundraising site Kickstarter by May 19. The money would go to finish post-production on Dutcher’s film “The Boys at the Bar,” a comedy about St. Louis friends gathering at their favorite Irish bar. As of Wednesday, 176 backers have signed on to give $13,373. “I thought [the fast] would be a really interesting way to focus everything on this one effort,” Dutcher said. “Also, if the rest of the producing team saw what I was doing, it would inspire them to work harder.” The producers are a group Dutcher formed called Project 23, which began as a class he taught for fledgling filmmakers. He turned the class into a hands-on experience, running the students through the process of financing and shooting his script. The movie was shot last year at a bar in Trolley Square, after hours, and has been edited. It still requires finishing touches — including color correction, sound mixing, a musical score, one special-effects shot and marketing — on which the $30,000 from Kickstarter would be spent. Mounting a Kickstarter campaign “really is work,” Dutcher said. “People have this assumption that people come and just give money.” Instead, Dutcher and Rock have worked their contacts, via social media and elsewhere, hitting people up to donate. “You have to personally appeal to each of those people,” Dutcher said. Kickstarter has generated controversy in recent weeks as some big Hollywood names — people who usually get funded through traditional channels — have used the site to drum up pledges and publicity. The creators of the defunct TV series “Veronica Mars” last month raised $5.7 million toward a movie version of the show. And two weeks ago, actor and filmmaker Zach Braff, who starred on TV’s “Scrubs” and directed himself in 2004 Sundance Film Festival hit “Garden State,” launched a campaign for his next movie, “Wish I Was Here,” which has raised $2.4 million so far. Braff’s campaign, in particular, has drawn critics on the Internet, who have accused the actor of subverting Kickstarter’s original purpose. “Kickstarter allows filmmakers who otherwise would have NO access to Hollywood and NO access to serious investors to scrounge up enough money to make their movies,” TV writer Ken Levine (whose credits include episodes of “M*A*S*H” and “The Simpsons”) wrote on his blog. “Zach Braff has contacts. Zach Braff has a name. Zach Braff has a track record. Zach Braff has residuals. He can get in a room with money people.” Braff, Dutcher said, “is kind of spoiling the waters and messing it up [for others].” Dutcher has faced online criticism of his own during his “hunger strike,” Rock said — including “a lot of jabs” about his weight. She’s fought back all of them. “With my mad writing skills, I’ll just put them in their place,” Rock joked. “They are left speechless, because they don’t want any more of that crap.” Dutcher is unfazed by it all, she said. “He’s really just been so zen.” movies@sltrib.com For more information about Richard Dutcher’s new movie, go to www.facebook.com/TheBoysAtTheBar Filmmaker Richard Dutcher Ends Hunger Strike \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmmaker Richard Dutcher has ended his water fast, an effort to concentrate on a Kickstarter campaign for his latest movie, \"The Boys at the Bar.\"By Sean P. Means | The Salt Lake TribuneThe Provo filmmaker on Sunday called off his planned three-week fast, more than a week early. He began on April 28 to focus his energies on raising money to finish his latest movie. Dutcher, in a post Sunday afternoon on Facebook, explained that he gave up the fast \"due to almost losing consciousness on a couple of occasions, vomiting 7 times a day, and starting to see blood in the vomit.\" What Dutcher called a \"hunger strike\" drew attention to a fund-raising campaign on the website Kickstarter, aimed at raising $30,000 in finishing funds for \"The Boys at the Bar.\" The movie, a bar comedy Dutcher wrote and directed, was shot last year at Trolley Square – but still requires a music score and other post-production touches. As of Sunday, the Kickstarter campaign has raised $16,277 – with nearly $3,000 of that pledged since an article about Dutcher’s fast appeared Thursday on The Salt Lake Tribune’s website. The campaign ends May 19. Dutcher said he started vomiting last Monday, Day 8. On Wednesday, Day 10, Dutcher told The Tribune that \"sometimes you feel surprisingly well and energetic. And other times you feel like lying down and dying.\" X96 \n\n\nThe give-away to the highest donor between 8 am and midnight tonight! (Not the candy) \n \n\n \n Risks and challenges Most of the risks associated with this project are in the past. Films are often at risk during pre-production and production. But we are now well into post-production. All our work is backed up and protected. All that will slow us down now is the lack of finishing funds. I've taken 7 feature films through the entire process. I'm not at all worried about \"The Boys at the Bar.\" We're close to the finish line!

If we keep going, we can do more filming on location, obtain better music, and insure that this film is shown in theaters all over the world. We promise you that any money we receive beyond our minimum 300 thousand dollar budget will go directly to the enhancement, marketing and distribution of this film. Thank you again, all of you out there, for standing up against bigotry and joining our crusade to bring human rights to all! Why We  Want to Make this Documentary:  BRIDEGROOM,  will tell the emotional journey of Shane Bitney Crone and Tom Bridegroom, two young men in a loving and committed relationship – a relationship that was cut tragically short by a misstep off the side of a roof.  The story of what happened after this accidental death– of how people without the legal protections of marriage can find themselves completely shut out and ostracized-- is poignant, enraging and opens a window onto the issue of marriage equality like no speech or lecture ever will.  On May 7, 2012, the anniversary of Tom’s death, Shane made a video tribute to his greatest love entitled “It Could Happen To You.\" This film, posted on YouTube, has gotten over 2.7 million hits and inspired over 50 thousand e-mails and comments on YouTube and Facebook.  The impact of Shane’s original film and the raw nerve it touched for so many, tells us this is an important story that needs to be told… and told now.    How BRIDEGROOM Can be in Theaters by Fall: Our ambitious production schedule can be met if we immediately raise our bare minimum, fundraising goal of $300,000. To all of you Kickstarter novices out there: if we fall short of our goal during the designated donation period, we will lose all money raised, along with the opportunity to make this film, as well as play a meaningful role in the burgeoning debate over marriage equality. If we are in the fortunate position of having surpassed our minimum goal, we will use this money to enhance the production value of the film and pay for costly marketing, distribution and music. Watch the YouTube Video That Started it All: \n\n\nA message from Director/ Producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason: In March of 1986, my mother was diagnosed with AIDS, after receiving a contaminated blood transfusion. This occurred just as the pilot for “Designing Women” was getting underway. As I wrote much of the first season, sitting beside my mom, I was witness to the incredible prejudice and prevailing ignorance inflicted not just on her, but all the homosexual men who shared her hospital floor. Because of this, I was honored to write the Emmy nominated DW episode, “Killing all the Right People,” which was television’s first scripted show to tackle the hateful prejudice surrounding gays and AIDS. Little did I know that I would someday be provided with another opportunity to address this same kind of bigotry. It all began when I attended a gay wedding ceremony in Palm Springs, California. That night, a couple of unforgettable, young men named Shane and Tom joined my table. I learned they were “Designing Women” fans, madly in love and literally brimming with all their big plans for an exciting life together. Sadly, that possibility ended when Tom was killed in an accident last year. When I heard the news, I was haunted by the sheer weight of Shane’s loss. Even though I barely knew them, their good-hearted demeanors and earnest love had made an indelible impression on me. Then, a few weeks ago, I saw Shane’s YouTube posting, along with his bone crushing grief and the story of what happened to him after Tom’s death—and all because they were never allowed to marry. Like so many others who saw this video, I was deeply touched. And angered. I called Shane told him I wanted to make a documentary that would tell his and Tom’s love story from beginning to end. I have now seen all of Shane and Tom’s videos and home movies. Like a lot of young people, they routinely documented their lives—but this recorded history is so prolific, it almost seems as though they had a premonition or unconscious fear of not getting to live out something important. Tom and Shane were each other’s first and only loves. They are devoted, hardworking, unassuming and funny. Each is from a small town and each, in his own way, is imbued with the best kind of small town values. They are, in fact, the sort of young people who hold within themselves the promise of America. And that is why I want to bring to life, on film, this real life Romeo and Romeo—so that all who condemn them, might come face to face with exactly what it is they are opposing. Certainly the fact that Tom’s last name is Bridegroom is a lucky and serendipitous gift to a filmmaker. But it is so unusual, even a skeptic would find it hard not to also feel that Tom, in his own way, is now standing in for something larger than himself. I can think of no more powerful opportunity to change hearts and minds on this very important issue of human rights, than to tell the story of Shane and Tom, which at its core, is the struggle of all people who yearn to be who they are and love who they love.

Because we designed the shirts to be 13 colors, printing has to be full digital, which is expensive. We've found an online company that can do them for us, and provide delivery in 7 days. So once we close the kickstarter, your shirt will be shipped to you within a week, allowing a couple of days for shipping. Jason Cowdrey, one of the band dads, designed the shirts and is helping us with the kickstarter. We're doing the shirts to promote our band, Technicolor Monster, which consists of Isaac Cowdrey and Logan Hortenberry. We're a 2 piece band creating music for dreamers, fighters, punks, quiet kids, loud kids and those who just keep on smiling. If this campaign is successful, we will launch another kickstarter to fund a 5 song EP. Or if we sell more than 12 shirts here, we will use extra funds toward the recording at New Fidelity Studios here in Cincinnati. So, anything above $240 goes toward recording the EP. As an added bonus, we are shipping a 2 song CD with each shirt. It contains the songs \"Bones\" and Everything is Okay\". These songs plus 3 others will be on the EP. Thanks for supporting our campaign, we hope to see you wearing our shirt soon! Risks and challenges If we don't raise the money, we can't print the shirts and record our EP as quickly.

    "textDescription": "Story Ink+Smog Editions is Rosemary Dardick and Robin Belcher. Just over a year ago, we began working together to build a small letterpress print shop and urban paper goods company here in Los Angeles, California.  We've been working really hard making greeting cards and prints inspired by our love of cities and urban environments. Right now, we print everything by hand on a bottlejack press we built from scratch in our living room here in Koreatown. But everything is about to change! \n\n\nPrinting by hand on the bottle jack press we built from scratch in our Koreatown living room. \n \n\n \n\n\n We are very excited to announce that Ink+Smog Editions is expanding! Over the summer, we found out that good friends of ours who run L'appât , a small print shop in Rosemary's hometown of Montréal were moving to Europe and would not be able to take their equipment with them. After much deliberation, we decided to buy their 1960s Heidelberg Windmill letterpress, industrial Chandler&Price Craftsman paper cutter as well as their lead type and tools. Basically, we bought their whole shop! \n\n\nThe Heidelberg Windmill and C&P Craftsman hard at work in the L'appât studio, run by Rebecca Rosen and Quentin Pillot (photo from their website). \n \n\n \n\n\n This will be a complete game changer for us, it will allow us to function as a print shop for other people's projects as well as continue to offer our own line of urban paper goods.  \n\n\nSome of our urban paper goods. \n \n\n \n\n\n We'll also be able to run community workshops, and start an artist residency program for emerging artists in collaboration with The Pretty Gallery  here in Los Angeles. The Danielle DeMers  artist residency will give an emerging artist the opportunity to work with us in Los Angeles each summer in order to produce a special editioned work. This project is near and dear to our hearts, in memory of our dear friend who passed away recently. She was a printmaker and artist who herself would have benefited from this residency. \n\n\nOur brand new studio space! \n \n\n \nWe're literally in the middle of moving into our new studio right now, and our new equipment is about to start it's cross-country journey from Montreal to Los Angeles. But we can't do it alone! The Goal of our Kickstarter Campaign: \nHelp with some of the transportation costs for relocating the equipment from Montreal to Los Angeles and properly set up our new larger workspace. \nFounding the Danielle DeMers Residency program in collaboration with Pretty Gallery. \nCreating the framework to provide community workshops and artist collaborations. \n Your help and generosity mean the world to us as we work to grow our business in an intelligent and responsible way.  If you believe in what we're trying to do but can't contribute financially, the best thing you can do is share our project with your friends, family and followers on social media, every little bit helps!  Thank you for all of the encouragement and support you've given us over the past year, we can't do it without you!  Risks and challenges Any project involving complicated logistics and crossing international borders has the potential for unforeseen delays and unexpected obstacles. We've been working with a team of experienced machinery movers and customs brokers. So far, everything is going according to plan. We now know more about moving heavy machinery than we ever thought possible! \n\nThe equipment is currently wending it's way west from Montreal to our new studio here in Los Angeles. Once our new equipment arrives here in L.A., we are going to need to make sure that everything is still in perfect working order. We've reached out to some of the more established printers that we know in order to benefit from their knowledge and experience.\n\nWe're not going to lie, this is a really big change, and while it's incredibly exciting, it's also a little terrifying! We've been building our business carefully over the past year and believe that while this change is big, it's also necessary in order to meet our growing demand.\n\nWe look forward to becoming your neighborhood Los Angeles print shop in the new year.

This new process has required my full surrender, great patience and total honesty.   I came to the end of myself.  I got desperate.  God began to awaken me to things I was doing to avoid my inner self, my feelings and my wounds and my own heart.  The first step toward healing was a willingness to experience pain.  I had to say “yes”, to a wilderness.  My theology began to change - for the better.  Never before had I seen a desert as a beautiful place.   There are many GREAT opportunities to please Him when you're tired, hungry and thirsty, and He's the only one who can sustain you.  This is the soil where faith takes root and grows.  The desert is beautiful because it is the place where all you have is HIM.  That brings me to my request.  I'm ready to record my third solo project and I'm inviting you to be a part.  The songs I have compiled have been written from this journey.  They are songs of joy in the wilderness and reminders that God is not only faithful, but GENEROUS to His own.  They are truths I have to come to know.  I believe they will encourage, challenge and comfort you.  If you're wondering about the style of the music, you can expect fresh production intertwined with new and compelling piano melodies.   Although the overtone of this record may be about the desert places in our lives, I believe the music will convey the joy and delight of God's presence with us, leading us every step of the way.  I am delighted to be able to bring my dear friend, Adam Moritz,  into the production of this new project.  He has great instinct for the musical direction and is just a blast to hang out with.

Some of the pledge rewards in addition to original artwork: 3\"X5\" sticker 8\"X10\" Sticker Sheet 8\"X12\" Metal Signs Video Transcript Hello Kickstarters, \n\nMy name is Robert Burke and I’m and artist who has been working in the Southeast, painting my own whimsical creatures over the last 20 years. \n\nI went to art school in the late 80s and have been working really hard on a pretentious artist statement ever since, but it just doesn’t work for me. I suppose the only thing I want to do with my art, is make people smile. \n\nMy art is simple, whimsical and easily recognizable. But this wasn’t always so. Back when I first had the stupid idea to become an artist, I was doing crazy surrealist paintings like this, or this..... After all, what 20-year old doesn’t think Salvador Dali and Max Ernst were the best artists to ever live? Well luckily, I got over that phase.  \n\nI had a desire to do something more immediate and after I discovered the work of Keith Haring I saw something exciting about his primitive style and the spirit contained within his thick black lines. \n\nI started to experiment and soon had drawn some whimsical creatures that got some great feedback, so I stuck with it. I won’t give you the details of the last 20 years of evolution, but after many gallery shows (including one with the late, great Howard Finster), and public murals which appeared on the walls of many coffee shops and restaurants in the Southeast, including a hand painted McDonald’s restaurant, I found support from the Thomas Jefferson Center For The Protection Of Freedom Of Expression in a first amendment lawsuit I filed after one of my murals was censored by the City of Charleston, SC. They deemed the colors I used as too “garish” and said it didn’t fit in with the historic theme of the city. \n\nMeh... \n\nI lost the case at the 4th circuit on standing. \n\nNo biggie. \n\nEventually I took the path of many young artists. I fell in love, got married and had children. I settled into what parents would call a “real career” in technology, and my creatures settled comfortably into the background of my life. \n\nWell, over the last couple years my children reached school age and I’ve had more time to get back into my art in a big way. \n\nAlright, so about my creatures... \n\nMy creatures are not developed as complete units and I don’t think about what I’m going to do before I start a new painting. \nYou see, over the years I’ve developed a vocabulary of lines - an alphabet of creature parts. Different noses, ears, legs, bodies, tails, wings, etc... \n\nSo when I begin a new painting I grab a blank canvas and start with the eyes. Sometimes it’s one eye, sometimes two, sometimes 3 or more. Then I put my alphabet of creature parts together with automatic drawing. That is, I don’t think, I just do. \n\nThe end result is usually a creature that I’ve never seen before. This keeps it exciting for me, and sometimes I feel like I have to create every creature possible, which is a bit obsessive and wacky since that would be impossible. \n\nSometimes the creatures come out cute, and sometimes weird, but what I love the most is that that many times they emerge with their own strong personalities. \n\nThe greatest joy is when I see someone walk into my booth at an art show and smile. Not because of me, or anything I’ve done, but because something with a particular creature makes them chuckle inside.  \n\nThis is why I create. \n\nI also think in our current world  is  a place where diversity is espoused by most, but not truly embraced. At the highest level, my paintings are not just a statement for tolerance, but a complete embrace of the beauty of diversity. \n\nIt’s not until we grow up that we start separating ourselves. \n\nJust as humans have the same parts, but are shaped, and colored in different, sometimes subtle ways, so is my art. And although I would love to think my art could help people see how special diversity is, I’m not so pretentious to think I can do that.  \n\nSo, I’ll settle for a smile. \n\nSo what’s my project? \n\nWell, I want to complete a series  of paintings that I don’t design with my usual automatic drawing, but that are designed by you. \n\nI provide a list of my alphabet to you, that is different creature parts and you tell me which ones to use. \n\nYou pick a nose, ears, body, etc. From there, I create the creature you designed, post it to the web and send you the original. \n\nIt’s a true collaboration between an artist and the viewer. \n\nI get the artist credit and you get the designer credit. \n\nI hope you’ll see value in my idea and give it a try, I would love to see what you come up with!

This tally will be updated twice a day. \n\n\nOff-site payments: Backers: 4, Total: $282 .75  \n Stretch Goal total (updated 8:45 AM, 9-29): Backers: 142, Total: $5457.75 At $5250 : A free digital stamp download of a piece of Ellen's artwork, Monster Hug. (Because stretch goals ought to be fun for the digital-only folks, too!) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt $5500 : Reprints of Steam Dreaming !  \nAt $5750 : A second free digital stamp. (To be unveiled!) \nAt $6000 : Reprints of The Faeries of Victoria Griffin! \n\nAfter that, I'll start looking at reprinting more of out-of-stock titles, like Steam Dreaming ,The Fairies of Victoria Griffin , or Dragons, Fairies, and Fantasy Horses 2 !  \n\nAdd-ons \nLooking for more goodies to download? Add additional coloring book PDF files to any reward for $5 each. These are for personal use only, and there may be some noted exclusions from the print editions. Artists receive full royalties, as if these were print copy sales and PDFs are only available through this Kickstarter at this time. (Remember, you get one PDF free with every reward level, and this add-on is ONLY available with a reward level pledge.) \nCurrent PDF choices: Fishpond Fantasies; The Faeries of Victoria Griffin Volume 1; The Faeries of Victoria Griffin Volume 2; Gardens and Goddesses; Apples and Roses; Songgryphons; Brain Celebration; Dotminatrix; Fantastrix (abridged); Dragons, Fairies, and Fantasy Horses; Goddesses of the World; Gardens and Goddesses Volume 2; Scheherazade's Shimmy; Steam Dreaming; Wings of Night; Midnight Gardens. (16 total) \nSpecial! Add ALL the PDFs to your reward tier for $50 (+ the value of your reward). Valued at $75! \n \n Risks and challenges I am a veteran of 24 coloring books at this point, and I've got the process pretty well down. I've printed several titles through my current printer and I'm really happy with their service and response time - plus they are local, so I can go hassle them in person if there's a problem! \n\nMy first Kickstarter, Fantastix, was a wild ride and a great success. My backers have expressed nothing but delight in my service and product; I'm hopeful I can make all my backers as happy this time, as well! \n\nI will be doing proofs during the Kickstarter campaign itself, so you'll get to see photographs of the actual product as we go along. The artwork is all completed and selected, and contracts with all artists are finalized. The only risks I see, then, are that there may be delays in modifying the cover layouts if we get to stretch goals for color... or life in general may cause an unforeseen delay in shipping, as it's a one-woman operation over here. I'm starting the campaign rather later in the year than I'd like, but I'm hopeful that I've got enough of my work done, and I've done this enough times now, that things will go smoothly and you'll get your coloring books with plenty of time for holiday gift-giving. There is always a risk of delays by the shipping service, but I fear that is out of my hands! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story I've always been a nature spirit. As a girl, I found comfort in mother earth and yearned for sacredness and ritual and celebration and honouring of rites of passage. Something that felt missing for me from our culture. I guess it's that yearning that is still leading me to rediscovering, exploring and empowering my inner Medicine Woman. \n\n\nWild Woman Dreaming, Kathy Popplewell \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\nMy inner medicine woman has been whispering to me for some time, calling for me to step more deeply into her, to allow her energy and wisdom to infuse with mine.  And then to share that wisdom and awakening with others. On New Years Day this year, I walked up the mountain in my remote Daintree Love rainforest home. I called to mother earth and to our ancient ancestors of womanly wisdom and medicine, and asked them to let me be their vessel, to show and support and guide me to the work they most need me to do here upon this earth at this time on our planet... Her message to me..... Play the medicine drum. Sing in ancient song. And to share it with the world. There is an inner knowing. An inner guidance. A flow from something beyond me. I know it's significant... It is but a small and yet important thread in an elaborate web of life. In healing. In birthing a new and yet old and ancient way to be in the world. In bringing back remembering of our inner and ancient wisdom as women. \n\n\nRelease and Rejuvenate Women's Retreat Day with Kathy Popplewell, March 2015 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nWild Woman Dreaming Power in Sacred Women's Gatherings \n \n\n \n\n\nDuring a recent visit to my hometown of the Central Coast in NSW, Australia I asked a friend, (Keesha, pictured on the left)  if I could borrow her medicine drum.  And she generously allowed me to borrow if for about 3 weeks during my visit whilst I was running some Women's Red Tent Circles and Retreat Days.  This was pretty special and an honour to be allowed to use it as I believe drums are often sacred to their users as they both absorb and resonate and share energy (thanks so much Keesha!). It was a gift and blessing. A great opportunity to try out the instrument and feel the flow.  And hear the feedback from the women who attended as well, about how powerful their experiences were when I played the drum and sang.  And their confidence as well that I need to keep playing it, and singing with it, and sharing it.... Something which I haven't been taught. Something that it just feels like I have to do.   The yearning to have my own drum created, and to play it and sing with it has grown much deeper and stronger from the experience I had whilst borrowing the drum for that short time. I hope to manifest my own drum soon.  And with you're help, I will be able to do it. I have found an amazing woman who makes drums and can paint a totem animal on it for me.... Which for this project I know to be an owl. Here is a couple of samples of her work. \n\n\nA sample of a Medicine Drum made by Vicki Liddell, the woman I hope will make my drum and paint my drum! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA sample of an Owl Artwork by Vicki Liddell, the woman I have found that I hope will make and paint my Drum! \n \n\n \n\n\n But I need your help to raise the funds to get it all started.  To have the drum created, painted and mailed to me up here in our remote rainforest hideaway in the womb of the great mother earth. I already have the other tools with which I can start creating the audios, videos, meditations and more... I just need the drum now and I know it will be born.... Will you help me make this vision and dream come to life? I'm not asking for something for nothing. Their are great rewards available. After all, this is a great exploration to if there is an interest out their in this great big wide world cosmos for what I would create.... If I get the following and backing... I'll know there is an interest out there... And it will confirm my intuitive guidance and I will be so totally delighted to create these magical, empowering, ancient, guided journeys for you from the magical and ancient feminine energy of the Daintree Rainforest! \n\n\nWill YOU support me in the vision of creating Wild Woman Dreaming from the Daintree Rainforest in Far North QLD, Australia \n \n\n \n\n\n STAGE ONE:  By raising our goal amount $490. Having a hand made and specially crafted Medicine Drum created, painted (with totem owl) especially for me and this project, and sent to me.  This will then allow me to create ALL creations mentioned in the Rewards! WooHoo!!! Including the following Audios/Albums... \nWild Woman Dreaming: A Guided Meditation for Woman  \nWild Woman Dreaming, Album of Drum & Song. \nWild Woman Dreaming Affirmations. \n All featuring the new medicine drum being played by me with my vocals and being recorded in the amazingly spectacular Daintree Rainforest of Far North Queensland Australia! \n\n\nI'll be creating and recording all these audios in my remote backyard of the magical and mystical Daintree Rainforest! \n \n\n \n\n\n STAGE TWO: If this Medicine DrumRaising reaches $990. If we go over our original goal and make more, I'll also be able to buy a super wiz bang awesome microphone to do spectacular recordings and make our Medicine Woman Dreaming audios, meditation series and album all the more high quality for your listening pleasure. STAGE THREE: Any dollars raised above and beyond that will go towards getting more instruments and my own 4wd vehicle so I can have more freedom in spreading the Wild Woman Dreaming vibration, love and experience throughout our FNQ region and beyond, and eventually set up a few little cabins on our remote Daintree Rainforest property to run small group and private Wild Woman Dreaming Retreats tucked away in nature where you can truly explore the WildWoman in you. Thanks for Checking out My Kickstarter Medicine DrumRaising: Wild Woman Dreaming Campaign! Have you checked out the rewards yet?  Go on, have a look! Risks and challenges Risk n Challenge 1: \n----------------------\nIf the drum maker I have made contact with pulls out of making the drum.\n\nSolution:\nI will find another drum maker. \n\n\nRisk n Challenge 2: \n----------------------\nDelay in drum arriving to me due to delay in it being made or delay in delivery.\n\nOutcome:\nWe just have to wait a little longer to get the creation started. But it will all still happen, just a minor delay.\n\n\nRisk n Challenge 3: \n----------------------\nIt's raining when I want to film and record audio's.\n\nSolution:\nWait for better weather OR even use the weather as a feature and create special tracks that feature the rain and water element in the album or for guided meditations!\n\n\nRisk n Challenge 4: \n----------------------\nInternet connection not strong enough when wanting to upload and send out audio files of Wild Woman Dreaming onto internet and to backers. \n\nSolutions:\nSave files onto a USB. Hire a person who can upload and send them all for me and mail the files to them. OR create hard copies of files onto CDs and mail to backers.

The program is home to 15 high school students from Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti, Uganda, Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo and Kenya. In addition to one-­on-­one literacy tutoring, college prep assistance, creative writing, job skills and leadership training, the students also participate in arts programming. This year's concentration is the film project featured in the above video led by teaching artists, David Meiklejohn (filmmaker and director of My Heart is An Idiot ) and hip-hop recording artist, Sontiago (Endemik Music ). On May 24th, the students will premiere their short films in their hometown of Portland, Maine at Space Gallery . Over half of the students in the program have not spent time in another city outside of Portland. Over half of the students have not spent time in Boston, though it is a mere two hours away. Over half of the students have not traveled by train. If funded, our plan is to travel to Boston via the Downeaster train and spend the day in the city visiting a sister writing center and pairing up with Boston-area young writers. In the evening we will rent a film house that holds 250 people and screen the 15 original short films featuring each YWL student performing their individual stories based on myths about America and life as new Americans.

    "textDescription": "Story Storytime - A Little Art Book In 2014, I had my first solo art exhibit at Gallery 1988 in Los Angeles, CA. The concept was simple, I took some of my favorite Movies, Music, TV Shows, and Video Games and turned them into covers of children's books. The show was a huge success and the response to my work was overwhelming. \"Storytime \" reached the front page of Reddit , was featured on sites such as Buzzfeed , Nerdist , Slashfilm , io9 , FunnyOrDie , and was even covered by Reading Rainbow . It has been pinned, reblogged, tumblr'd, tweeted, and liked hundreds of thousands of times over.  In 2015 I followed up the successful first show with \"Storytime 2 \". Once again, the response was overwhelmingly positive. I have continued the art series beyond the gallery, debuting new prints at various conventions across the United States. One of the things I continually hear from fans that visit me at conventions is that they wish that I would make a book collecting the entire series... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is to fund a full-color 132 page book collecting every print from my \"Storytime\" series that I first started in 2013. But I can't do it alone, I need your help. Each page will feature full color artwork, and bring all of my artwork from this series together for the first time in one collection.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMock-up of the front and back cover art for the book \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOne image per page, in full color. \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nArtwork information is listed below on each page. \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample of what the layout of the book will look like. \n \n\n \n\n\n Below are some articles featuring artwork from my Storytime series: Slashfilm , io9 , Nerdist , Tribeca Film Festival , Kotaku , and Geek Art \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSorry, this reward tier has filled up! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWE DID IT! We unlocked this stretch goal! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmazing! This is the book everyone will be getting now! \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWow! Now the book is just a little bit bigger :) \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe did it! 4 more pages added to the book! \n \n\n \n\n\nWhy Kickstarter? This is a book that I have wanted to put together, and that many fans have requested but self-publishing a book like this can be costly. I wanted to do this with the freedom that can sometimes be limited when working with a publisher which is why I’m turning to Kickstarter. Only with your help can this project become a reality. The fundraising goal will allow me to print 2,000 Softcover copies of the book. If the stretch goals are unlocked, each book will be upgraded to a Hardcover book. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe funding goal for this Kickstarter will cover the expenses of the entire project. This covers the printing of the book, and having it shipped here to Los Angeles. It also covers the cost of printing the rewards, Kickstarter fees, payment processing fees, and a little bit extra for any miscellaneous costs that I may encounter a long the way. If funding surpasses the stretch goals, I will be able to produce more than 2,000 copies.  Together, we can make this happen! Thanks for stopping by and THANK YOU for your support! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Risks and challenges The risks and challenges for this project are pretty low. The artwork in the book has already been created, the book is designed, laid-out, and is ready to be sent to the printer. If the project hits the stretch goals, I already have the necessary cover-artwork changes made for that. All of the work on the book is complete. It just needs your help to be printed.\n\nThe rewards for this Kickstarter will be shipped with the book. Outside of the higher-tier commissions, all of the reward artwork is already created. Packaging and shipping of the finished book along with rewards will be handled directly by me, and hopefully a few family members, friends, and some pizza. Providing there's no issues with the book manufacturing/shipping, my goal is to have the book and rewards in backers hands in January 2017 (international orders may take a little longer due to customs and overseas shipping).\n\nThere is about a 10 week turnaround on production of the book that includes shipping from overseas. If the project is fully funded, and after payment is received (usually about 2 weeks after a successful Kickstarter ends) I will send everything off to be turned into a book!

    "textDescription": "Story 'Snow Dog Under My Bed' is inspired by our Alaskan Malamute, Sesil and daughter, Charlotte.  In this adorable book, children will experience what a day is like living with a snow dog and will share the special connection despite his giant size and fondness for licking toes.  \nI wrote this book for my daughter after struggling to find anything on the market about snow dogs.  I have never met a child that hasn't wanted to come over for a pat and cuddle with Sesi.  Each page is developed to capture the imagination of the reader and what it would be like if they had a giant fluffy snow dog sleeping in their room.  \nThe book is aimed at 0-6 year olds and is 12 pages long. The size of the book will be 7 x 7 inches or 18 x 18 cm printed on premium matte paper and softcover.  \nProject so far and the plan: \nThe book has been completely written and I have found an illustrator who has finalised one sample drawing to bring the characters to life.  My plan to have this book published is to finalise the illustrations and self publish through 'Blurb'.  In order to do this I require $840AUD for illustrations and $4,340 for publishing costs, total being $5180.  This is to create 200 copies.   \nThis is where you come in. For a $30 pledge you will receive a copy of the book (signed and dedicated for your child/children).  My goal is to have the book fully illustrated for submission to publishing houses and hopefully be accepted.  I will ensure the project is complete before this Christmas. Thank you! \nSample of the Book: \nI’m awakened by a snort, \nIt’s coming from under my bed, \nI hang down to take a peep, \nAnd see a fluffy great head. \n\nHe is laying on his back, \nOne leg stretched in the air, \nHis fur the colour of winter, \nHis body as big as a bear. \n\nThe night is cold and windy, \nBut Sesi is warm and snug, \nYou see he is a snow dog, \nAnd his fur is like a rug. Risks and challenges The illustrator I have used for the sample may not longer be able to complete the project and I need to find someone else. Shipping could slow production.

    "textDescription": "Story First of all, thanks to everyone who backed our project! If you missed out on our Kickstarter, head over to our website for all the latest news and updates:  http://www.militiaminiatures.co.uk/   Once we have fulfilled all of our pledges, the figures will be given a proper release, and will be available through Minibits: http://www.minibits.net/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is Militia Miniatures?\n Militia Miniatures is a new miniatures company, part of Minibits (www.minibits.net ), with our aim being to produce a range of modern mercenary character figures, suitable for wargaming, roleplaying, or simply collecting and painting. We've taken inspiration from various sources, from real life combat troops through to computer games, and then we've added a dash of Hollywood as well!  We've put together a group of interesting characters, all with different personalities, that you'll enjoy adding to your games. What's the project? For this project, we'll initially be producing 8 unique character figures.  If we can hit and exceed our target, we will add 2 more sculpts, one at the £2000 mark and one at the £2500 mark.  These will be added as freebies to certain pledges.  If we break through even higher, we've got some extra goodies on hand that we can include as Add-Ons. \n\n\nThe 8-man team! \n \n\n \n\n\nSo why Kickstarter? We've invested enough so far to cover the initial sculpts, but there are a lot more costs involved in bringing any range to market, such as moulding, production, packaging etc.  Launching these through Kickstarter allows us to get all the moulds done in one go, and also potentially allows us to add more items to the range up front.  Releasing these figures by the traditional methods would mean one or two at a time, the sales from each one hopefully paying for the next mould, and so on.   The bonus to you the customer, is that you'll be the first to get your hands on these figures, and at a greatly discounted rate as well, up to 40% off RRP! What are the pledge levels?\n We're keeping things as nice and simple as possible, so simply decide how many of the figures you would like to receive and pledge the corresponding amount: Any 1 figure = £5 pledge - Pick any figure from the available selection. Any 3 figures = £10 pledge - Pick any 3 figures from the available selection. Any 5 figures = £14 pledge - Pick any 5 figures from the available selection. All 8 figures (one of each) = £20 pledge - One of every sculpt in the range, plus each of the unlocked sculpts will be added FREE to this pledg e (potentially 10 figures at over 40% discount on RRP!). Any 10 figures = £24 pledge - Pick any 10 figures from the available selection. Any 20 figures = £40 pledge - Pick any 20 figures from the available selection, perfect for groups of friends or club members to share. NOTE: For all pledges except 'FULL SQUAD', you can mix and match any of the sculpts ! All pledge levels include UK shipping, anyone from outside the UK will need to add £2 to their pledge (£3 for the 'BULK DEAL' pledge). We are also proud to announce that Brent Spivey of Bombshell Games has agreed to give us 20 free electronic copies of his 'The Battlefield' rules, bringing tactical first and third person modern combat shooter experiences to the tabletop!  More info on these rules can be found here: http://bombshell-games.com/battlefield/ These were only available through the 'FIRST TO FIGHT' pledge level, but have all sold out! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate! Brent at Bombshell Games has kindly agreed for us to offer a discounted pdf of his 'The Battlefield' rules for those who missed out on the freebie pledge level.  This offer is available for the bargain price of £3 (usual RRP - $9.99 / £6) and to take advantage of this, simply add £3 to your pledge! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I pledge? Aside from the fantastic sculpts shown below, there are 3 big reasons: 1. Low funding target - We've set a realistic target to ensure that we can hit funding and get these figures into production.  Any pledges over our target will unlock extra goodies! 2. Low pledge levels - We've set sensible pledge levels so that more people can get involved. The 'FULL SQUAD' pledge equates to over 40% discount on RRP, so offers great value. 3. Quick turnaround - We've worked hard to make sure that everything we need is in place and ready to go once we hit funding.  We've worked in the wargames industry for many years now, so we've got all the know-how at hand to get these into production and into your hands within 8-10 weeks of the Kickstarter finishing. So, what do I do next? Have a look through the excellent sculpts below, decide how many you want, and get pledging! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery team needs someone to look after the money and keep the jobs coming in. With contacts around the world, Goldman can always find another tricky situation to throw the team into. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n The most senior member of the team, Granger is a respected veteran who has been there, done it and gone back for more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trained in a variety of hand-to-hand combat techniques, he's still a \ndangerous prospect even when disarmed.  He's also second-in-command to \nGranger and is deathly serious about what he does. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Intelligent and careful, Andersen can always be relied on in a tight \nspot.  Easygoing and laid back, he'll take the time to assess the \nsituation before going in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bennett has one motto in life: 'The bigger the problem, the bigger the \ngun.'  He might not be the sharpest tool in the box, but you'll \ncertainly want him around when the bullets are flying! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Connor is a bit of a practical joker and enjoys winding the others up \nwhenever he can.  When it's time to work though, he is efficient and \nreliable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sullen and moody on the outside, this skilled knifeman is certainly not \nto be messed with.  He doesn't stand for any nonsense at work and is \nfiercely loyal to his friends. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStrike is the techguy, and one of the few in the group who knows what a \n'Tweet' is.  It's taken a while, but he's slowly dragging the group into\n the 21st century with some handy gadgets. \nStretch Goals! £2000 - Achieved! We've now added Charlie to the line up!  She will be added FREE to any 'FULL SQUAD' pledges, and is available for selection on all other pledge levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Being the only girl in the group could have been a difficult job for \nCharlie, but from the minute she gave Bennett a wedgie she was accepted \nas one of the guys. £2500 - Achieved! We've now added the fantastic Ghost sculpt to the line up!   He will be added FREE to any 'FULL SQUAD' pledges, and is available for selection on all other pledge levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA master of field craft, Ghost can disappear into his surroundings easily\n and keep himself concealed for days on end.  His patience and precision\n make him a highly valued member of the team. We've also got some cool accessories available, which can be added either as Freebies or Add-On's ! \nBoxes and Sacks \n These are a freebie option and every pledge level at 'FULL SQUAD' or above will receive 1 FREE pack of Boxes (contains 6 different boxes) AND 1 FREE pack of Sacks (contains 6 sacks, in 3 different sizes).  If you would like extra Boxes or Sacks, please add £1 per pack to your pledge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrums and Crates These are now available on all pledge levels, simply increase your pledge by £1 for every pack of Drums or Crates you would like.  So: - If you want 1 x Drums, simply add £1 to your pledge. - If you want 3 x Drums and 1 x Crates, simply add £4 to your pledge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£3000 -  Objective Marker! Our Objective Marker is now unlocked and available, simply add £2 to your pledge for each 70mm wide marker you would like: \n\n\n\n\n\nAs an extra bonus, we will now be adding free bases to every pledge level. Lasercut from 2mm MDF, we'll have either 20mm or 25mm widths, in either square or circular options. (If some folk need a different size, I'm sure we can sort that out!)  \n\n\n\n\n\n- And as a final bonus for everyone who has pledged into this project, we're giving everyone 20% off anything they want from the Minibits website: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions at all, please let us know!\n Risks and challenges The potential risks and challenges on this project are few. We have already paid out for the sculpts, and they are with us here in the UK. The next step will be the moulding, but with my work for Pendraken Miniatures, we have a wealth of knowledge and experience at hand, and all of the moulding and casting will be dealt with by professionals.\n\nWe have always taken a huge amount of pride in customer service, and we are extremely confident that we will not only deliver a quality product, but that we will also have it in your hands very quickly!

    "textDescription": "Story Our Goal In January 2014, I have a collaborative exhibition with writer Patricia Ann McNair (who is also my wife) at 1078 Gallery in Chico, California, called Places I've Never Been . It combines two mixed-media projects that explore, in printmaking, text, and sound, how we represent places we've never visited or people we've never met, through an act of imagination. We will use your pledge to help fund the following: Materials for a free community workshop that Patty and I are offering to the local Chico community. We will encourage participants to explore, in their own writing and drawing, ideas about place, whether real, remembered, or imagined. Printing a chapbook containing a new essay by Patricia Ann McNair about her grandfather's experience as a missionary in Korea between 1911-1923 (see below), and her relationship with that history. The chapbook will also contain prints taken from the 100 year old Kodak Brownie negatives, taken by Patty's grandfather in Korea.\n\n A limited edition DVD containing the films and audio recordings from the exhibition projects, plus some new audio recordings. \nAn edition of a linocut print based on the Korean print series. Some of the costs to ship exhibition materials to and from California (we live in Chicago, Illinois). Some of the transportation costs related to attending the exhibition. Oh, and one week of cat sitting fees! More about the exhibition  \n• Climbing the Crooked Trails , a print-audio collaboration originating in a collection of letters and Kodak Brownie photographic negatives bequeathed by McNair’s maternal grandfather, who was a missionary in Korea from 1911-1926. The work is a re-interpretation of the material through a collage of paper-litho prints on wood panels, and audio readings from the letters.  \n\n\n\nc. 1918, Reverend Wachs and Mrs Wachs on a Harley Davidson motorcycle, surrounded by Korean peasants and Japanese officials. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the 40 litho-transfer prints I made, based on the original century-old photos \n \n\n \n\n•The Lucerne Project , in which artist Philip Hartigan created an imaginary narrative about people he hasn’t met and a place he’s never been. Starting with a random selection of Lucerne, sister city to Hartigan’s current home Chicago, the artist adapted images of Lucerne found on the internet and turned them into a 100-page accordion book of prints, a fiction-filled blog, and a series of audio recordings accessed on smartphones via QR codes.  \n\n\n\nOne of the pages from the 100-page accordion book \n \n\n \n\n\nAbout the artists \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilip here : I'm a UK-born artist currently living in Chicago. My objects, prints, and films deal with half-remembered narrative moments—both from my own history, and the history of others. My work has been shown in more 30 exhibitions on both sides of the Atlantic. And (true story) I once exhibited with Prince Charles inside a British prison. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatty here : I'm an associate professor in Fiction Writing at Columbia College Chicago, where (blush) I was nominated for the Carnegie Foundation’s US Professor of the year. My short story collection, The Temple of Air, has been awarded Southern Illinois University’s Devil’s Kitchen Reading Award and the Society of Midland Authors (US) Finalist Award. I've won numerous Illinois Arts Council Awards and Pushcart Prize nominations, and I was named to the Chicago’s Newcity Lit 50 list. With my husband, Philip Hartigan, I've worked with small towns in the US toward developing community memoir and public art projects, and creating collaborative art curricula. \n\nWhat you get in return \n\n$15 pledge : A DVD containing the films and audio files from the project and exhibition:\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$25 pledge : a miniature work of art consisting of an image from the project printed onto a 2\" x 3\" block of wood:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$40 pledge : One of 8 artist's proof prints for The Lucerne Project accordion book. 6\" x 4\", printed in silver ink on textured printmaking paper, signed by Philip Hartigan: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$40 pledge : A copy of the Climbing the Crooked Trails chapbook that will be created specifically for this exhibition, containing a new memoir essay by Patricia Ann McNair and photo-prints by Philip Hartigan (photo shows facsimile copy: finished version may be slightly different format): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50 pledge : An original multi-colour linoleum print, created specifically for this exhibition: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$75 pledge : A 62-page softcover book, printed on premium gloss paper, containing all the images from The Lucerne Project's 100-page accordion book, plus selections from the fictional diary: \n\n\n\nCover + 2 interior pages. \n \n\n \n\n\n$100 pledge : 1 copy of the Climbing the Crooked Trails Chapbook + 1 copy of The Lucerne Project book. \n$100 pledge : One of the original proofs for The Lucerne Project's 100-page accordion book.

Make a small booklet using the photolitho transfer process that was used for most of the work in this exhibition. No previous printmaking experience required. \n\n\n\nMy lovely printing press, innit? \n \n\n \n\n\n$250 pledge : A writing/drawing workshop by Patty and Philip (within 100 mile radius of Chicago). We will come to your home or a venue of your choice, and do a 3 hour workshop for you and your invited guests exploring what 'place' means to you. For all levels of writers & artists: \n\n\n\nParticipants writing and drawing in a class we taught in 2012. \n \n\n \n\n\nReceiving your reward \n\nThanks so much for contributing to this project! We are so grateful that you felt our project was worth an investment. \n\nMost of the rewards will be sent by mail during March 2014, within two months of the show's closing. The chapbook will be mailed by end of April 2014. If you signed on for one of the workshops, we will work out a date with you, at your convenience. \n\nWhen you pledge, Kickstarter asks you to make a credit card payment using Amazon.com. Your card won't be charged until the funding period ends, and only if we reach our goal. If we don't (though we really hope we do!), you don't get charged anything \n\nAfter the funding period is over, you will be asked to complete a survey. To make sure that you receive your reward without any hitches, please make sure that you enter: \n\n\nA valid email address that you check regularly. \n\nAn up-to-date mailing address , with all correct particulars. The information you enter in the survey will be used by us to mail you your reward. \n Risks and challenges Once funded, the main challenge will be: getting people in the community of Chico, California, to participate in the workshop that we are offering. Because we live in Chicago, and the show is on the other side of the USA, we need to pay special attention to that. We're confident that not only will people attend, but that they will have a rewarding time, because Patty and I both have a lot of experience in: a) public art projects (Philip) and public reading series (Patty); organizing writing and art workshops (Philip and Patty); teaching in a way that encourages people's creativity from the get-go (Patty and Philip). We're also working with a good team at the gallery in Chico, who've done this sort of thing before! And, of course, it will be a challenge to leave our cats behind for one whole week!

    "textDescription": "Story Welcome to our Kickstarter campaign for our film, The Cloud Catcher. To be filmed in February 2016 and released in May.  Synopsis \nSula is an 11-year-old girl, who carries a fishing net with her everywhere she goes. She is profoundly deaf as well as mute, and lives with her head in a book…\nShe lives on a fictional island in a fictional place called The Clouded Hemisphere. Because of the clouds, no one has ever seen the sun, the moon or the stars in the night sky, and not many people believe in them anymore – but there are still fairy tales about it. \nSula loves these old stories, however her family discourages her, as they believe she’s become too old for them. \nSo she goes on a journey to prove that they are true, but more importantly she wants to prove to herself and to everyone else that she’s a lot more capable than what is often perceived. Funding Your financial backing will allow this project happen, even though we do not pay ourselves we need to cover some essential costs. The team behind this film are doing lots of things to finance the project, but our backers will help us fund our film to it's full amount! \n\n\nUnfortunately it takes a lot of sweet stalls and raffles to raise our budget! \n \n\n \n\n\nThe money will be spent on paying our cast and keeping them fed on set. It will also go toward the travel costs of transporting a group of cast and crew and the cost of hiring locations. Unfortunately the specific locations we require are not in the immediate local area. (Not many people can create a fantasy world just around the corner.) This campaign will also help cover the cost of our unique props, costumes and set dressings. Our fundraising goal also covers our campaign costs to ensure that if we can reach our goal we will be ready to put this film straight into production and send out our perks shortly afterwards to show our backers how much we appreciate their support. Progress We are currently in our pre-production stage, with our final script being tweaked, soundtracks being explored and story boards being drawn! We are in the process of confirming an artist for our film, a set designer and a composer. Our director is also producing initial art work to show her vision, which we can share with you! \n\n\nSula's Storybook \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInitial drawing of Sula's island \n \n\n \n\n\nInfluences The film uses very little speech, similar to The Illusionist (2010). Its inspiration also takes from films with strong, young female leads, such as Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012) and Studio Ghibli’s animation Spirited Away (2001). Our Team We're a team based in Cornwall and most of our crew is currently studying at Falmouth University's, School of Film and Television. We will be updating this page with confirmation of new crew members as well as other exciting news! Now a bit more from each of us... \n\n\nDirector: Hannah French \n \n\n \n\n\nI have worked on a range of projects, that have allowed me to experience many different roles as a filmmaker. Last year, I worked on two films: a documentary, Porfell (2014) and made an experimental film, Roller Skates and Daisy Chains (2015) – which both received a special mention at Pixelate Film Festival. This Year I would like to achieve even greater success with The Cloud Catcher. I wanted to make something that I thought was unique and risky, while making it fun. The themes that run throughout the film may be serious and hard hitting to some, but the story is one of hope and achievement. \n\n\nProducer: Edel Fowell \n \n\n \n\n\n I have experience producing several short films and events, It’s up to me to manage all areas of the production logistically, financially and legally as well as keeping up morale on set on cold February days. I’ve got a passionate crew behind me with a great vision and a lovely story that deserves to be told. I’m confident we’re going to produce a film to be proud of, that only we could make and one that our backers will be excited to see.  \n\n\nDirector of Photography: Andrew Neil \n \n\n \n\n\nThrough my University film degree I have gained great experience working on many short films. My greatest experience comes from working in the camera department, which is why I will be taking on the role of Director of Photography. My background comes from within the film industry having being born in Southern California and having worked at several camera rental houses such as Otto Nemenz Hollywood, Panavision UK and Movietech Pinewood UK. My greatest influence comes from my father who is a motion picture lens designer. Through the use of my knowledge on lighting, lenses, composition and shooting formats I will be bringing the director’s vision for the Cloud Catcher to life through the moving image. \n\n\n\n\nEditor: Jake Graves \n \n\n \n\n\n I'm responsible for the editing and colour grading of our film and I'm excited about piecing together Sula's story. I have previously edited short films including Blue Boy (2015),which received Best Narrative and joint Film of The Year at this years Pixelate Film Festival. We have some exciting things in store for post-production to make Sula's world come to life. \n\n\nSound Designer: Michael Tibbins \n \n\n \n\n\nAs sound designer for this project it is my job to build the auditory world that this film requires. I have worked on several student shorts films, one of which received an award for Best Narrative. I have also been a producer for a podcast, The Cinematologists. I'm very excited to be working on this project with the rest of the crew and bringing this fairytale world to life through the soundtrack \n\n\nAssistant Producer: Andrew Nile \n \n\n \n\n\nI'm responsible for assisting Edel with the production side of things. I was drawn to this project by the talent of the crew and the beautiful story of The Cloud Catcher. I'm extremely pleased and honoured to be working on this short film. I truly believe in this team and the story we are telling. This is my first time operating in a production position and I feel that working with Edel and the rest if the crew will be a great learning experience with a fantastic outcome. Risks and challenges There are several risks and challenges with this project. \n\nFirst of all scheduling will be an issue due to the fact we must film around our young actors educational needs, as per the terms of our licensing agreement with the local council. We will also be hoping to film under cover of clouds to aid the premise of the story, however this could leave a small window of opportunity to film. To minimise these risks we are negotiating permission to film in locations for longer than necessary, which will accommodate for reshoots. We have chosen to film in February to take advantage of school holidays as well as weekends with our actors. This time of year should also provide more chance of our desired weather patterns.\n\nIn order to deal with any additional timing issues that could arise we have been in contact with organisations that own our desired filming locations already, to ensure production can begin as soon we reach our funding goal. Plans have been confirmed for two to three days of filming, and marketing and exhibition plans have been confirmed for August 2016.

A toy that combined all the best stuff from my childhood (super robots, building toys, comics) and an epic backstory to lose yourself in. Did you say backstory? During the 1960’s, the world was in more danger than ever before. As mankind harnessed the atom, few knew that the innovations of super science would lead to the creation of kaiju sized terrors and rise of super powered tyrants. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As always, there were men and women who would rise to challenge to balance the scales of good….and evil. Among these new heroes was one with a heart of gold………and fists of steel! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enter….SATURN! A creation of a secret think tank determined to create earth's mightiest defender! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Wow that was something.....but what about the toy? Sounds like all you wanna do is make a comic? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Saturn is meant to be tied to the old tradition of toys and comics. This is done by Saturn being a DIY figure as opposed to an action figure. In that sense, he'll emulate the spirit of those novelties/toys that I used to see in the back of comic books before they disappeared altogether. Whereas back then you would be ripped off and disappointed, here you get more than you bargained for. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Okay sure, sounds nice. What’s in it for me? For backers of ($6) you get the pdf version of the comic as well as teasers to other projects I have in the pipeline. But for backers of ($10) you get the physical colored version of the comic and the pdf version of teasers to other projects that are yet to come. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBUT for backers of ($30) you get your very own Super Saturn 6 and the comic (both the pdf and physical copy) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Building plan: All work will be done in house with the exception of the printing of the comic. The project was designed to be able to be easy to manufacture utilizing the wonders of laser cutting and takes advantage of local chicago suppliers to cut down on shipping time and costs. The robot and the comic have both been finished and only need your support to begin construction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project was launched as a requirement for my Entrepreneurial Product Design class at the University of Illinois at Chicago. You can see all of the other campaigns at http://always-be-hustling.tumblr.com/kck2016 .

    "textDescription": "Story Hi, My name is Paul Keskey, and I am here at kickstarter to tell\nyou about my first book, A Field Guide to Chrysalies They’re not Faeries. The\nidea about Chrysalies came to me just before my son Jake was born in May 2001. What first started out to be a series of paintings developed into the book,\nabout sentient beings that have been mistakenly categorized as faeries in much\nof English literature. This is a basic field guide into how they enter the natural\nworld, some of their habits, culture, and the many different varieties of\nChrysalies that inhabit the earth. \n\nIt is about the world of Chrysalies and their stewardship in the natural world, as well as, a book about nature and it’s benefits.  How Funds Will Be Used \n\nThe Field Guide to Chrysalies there not Faeries will\nbe a soft cover, print run of 2,000. The book will measure 8.5”w x\n12”h.   The book will be printed in full color, with a\nsolid paper stock (100#) for the interior pages.  Of course, this all\ncosts money, and the quotes from the printer are close to $10,500.  I set\nthe Kickstarter Funding Goal for Chrysalies at $10,500.  If the\nFunding is achieved, the money will go directly into the printing costs to help\nalleviate the huge out of pocket expense. It has always been a dream of mine to create my own book. So I’m here on Kickstarter asking for your pledge, to\nhelp with the costs of printing and all other aspects involved to get the book\nout there.  With your help, this book will become a reality! \n\nThank you\nso much for your generous support! Below are some of the rewards that are available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostcards \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiclee Prints 11\"x15\" Image size  10\" x 13.3\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiclee Prints 18\" x 24\" image size of prints 16\" x 22\"  and the four original oils 18\" x 24\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Three of the twelve original drawings from the sketch book. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour of the ten Acrylic or watercolor paintngs.

    "textDescription": "Story On the shores of \"Tennessee's only bio-luminescent lake,\" the line \nbetween myth and reality is blurred. Would-be con artist, Timothy West, \nwill walk this line, improvising one elaborate scheme after another to \nkeep the money he stole from the church and pass himself off as a \nrepentant miracle worker. With his adopted brother, Light, reluctantly \nat his side, Timothy seems bound to make a clean getaway, unless a \ncertain legend turns out to be real. We're making a movie! We’ve been waiting for several years to spring this story on the known world.  We are trying to do more than make an exciting Southern con-movie with fake miracles, brotherly roughhousing, and a breathtaking underwater climax! We want to share the experience of making a movie with as many people as we can. And not just sharing the end product; we need your help and collaboration in every step. If you donate, we consider you a part of our team. We have gathered a talented cast and crew from across the country and are preparing to go into production in early August. Our plan for this film is to hit the festival circuit head-on, setting our sights on film festivals such as Sundance, SXSW, and our own Nashville film festival. We also plan to release on DVD and through online avenues such as Hulu. This project is bigger and better than anything we’ve ever done before. Dive in with us. You won’t regret it. We can't do it alone. We officially went into pre-production this February, and have spent much of that time looking for the right people to turn this vision into reality. As a result, we have the power of an all-star crew to carry this movie to its goal: \nStarring as the rough-and-tumble lead character, we have the talented Matt O'Leary . Since he was a kid, Matt has acted alongside the likes of John Travolta and Bill Paxton. He played The Brain, Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s brilliant sidekick in the neo-noir hit, Brick . Most recently, he starred in SXSW award sweeper, Natural Selection . Check out this clip from the film: http://videos.nymag.com/video/Natural-Selection-Linda-and-Ray \n \nHeading up the art department, and the folks responsible for creating the world of Jesus Fish , are Sophie Kosofsky and Bob Weisz . Sophie and Bob are experienced production designers and weird effect gurus who have worked on films such as Glory at Sea and spectacular music videos by the likes of MGMT , The Killers , and Manchester Orchestra . They are talented, yes. And experienced, true! But they also share our unique vision for the atmospheric universe we want to soak the story in. \nLeading us down into the Jesus Fish's mysterious underwater abode is AFI Cinematography Fellow, Boyd Hobbs . Boyd's work on the short film Loves Me Not earned him the 2010 ASC Undergraduate Student Heritage Award for outstanding cinematography. His experience as a certified SCUBA diver and underwater camera operator will bring a magical visual beauty to the film's crucial underwater sequences. Check out his website and reel . \nKeeping the ship running smoothly and efficiently are a wonderful group of familiar faces filling out the camera, lighting, production, etc. departments. These are skilled crew members who we not only trust to do an excellent job, but with whom we've become good friends. \n We need YOU! Obviously, making a movie like this is big undertaking, and it takes a whole lot of resources to pull off properly. We have accomplished a lot since February, but we still have much more to do before the cameras start rolling on August 6th. This is where you come in. We need your help, and lots of it! In order to make this happen, we need to raise a minimum of $20,000 by July 24th . The way Kickstarter works is that, if we don't meet our goal, then no money changes hands, and there's no Jesus Fish . But, if you want to see Timothy and Light come together as brothers and fight their way through a muddy cocktail of mystery and betrayal, then bring the Jesus Fish to life by joining our team. If you donate, your money will go directly to realizing this movie by meeting these needs: \n\nTransportation and Lodging . While the entire film will be shot in and around Dayton, TN, our team is made up of folks from, literally, all across the country, including California, Louisiana, and Florida. We need to get them to Tennessee so that they can work their magic. \n\nFood . A well-fed crew is a happy crew. We need to keep about 30 people happy for 7 days of shooting, not to mention all the extras. \n\nProduction Design . This story demands a specific atmosphere, and \nwe are confident that Bob and Sophie will knock it out of the park. They\n need to purchase the materials and resources necessary to bring the \natmosphere to life. \n\nEquipment . Anybody who has worked on a film set knows that there is a lot of gear involved. Things we need to rent include additional grip and lighting equipment, generators, lenses, and more. We will also need production insurance to cover these items. \n\nFilm Stock, Processing, and Transfer . The story and atmosphere of Jesus Fish begs to be exposed on film. Super 16mm is our format of choice for giving the movie the organic and textured look it requires. This, of course, means we must buy the film stock, then have it processed and transferred by a lab so that we can view and edit it. \n\nUnderwater . Shooting underwater introduces its own unique set of requirements, including SCUBA gear, safety divers, camera housings, and more. \n\nSpecial Effects . The script involves several special effects shots, including rain, lightning, and bioluminescence. \n Every dollar helps, but whether or not you can donate, one of the biggest ways you can help is by spreading the word. Email your friends, post a link on Facebook, Twitter, or record your own shout-out video and put it up on YouTube! Thanks for viewing, and we look forward to welcoming you to the team!

Early generations of these tools were purely analogue and required photo paper and dangerous chemicals to create images. This project seeks to construct a new generation of Light Hammer that will combine digital photography and advanced electronics to create a purely digital process. The requested funds will be used to cover materials and labor as well as the printing of reward materials (courtesy of Fiber Ink Studios ). The project is slated for completion by June 1st, with the delivery of rewards targeted for the end of the month. The ultimate goal is to have the new Light Hammer, and the images it creates, shown in one or more exhibitions by the end of 2012 with additional shows and installations in 2013.

    "textLength": 3116,
    "textDescription": "Story The Backward Fall is a hyper realistic piece with some moments of surrealism based around a family with the mother suffering from Alzheimer’s. It has some honest moments of how each family member reacts and cope having to live with the changes to their mother/wife, along with the humorous elements that come out of the mundane family life. The play is in two short acts either side of an interval. The basic plot of the 'traditional Sunday round mum's house' is repeated from the first act into the second. However as the Alzheimer’s worsens, the structure unravels as the characters do. We use physical sequences to show what the family cannot say to one another out right, and also to add light relief, yet show the subtext of the story. As well as this, the surreal physicality becomes the norm as the mother who is suffering with the illness is often the only character out of sync and 'natural'. This shows the illness through the flip side - that families do not witness in real life. We are able here, to see the family descend into madness as she hosts in her unravelling home. The message that essentially is the need to talk, to laugh, and to love could be said with words and lengthy asides. However, we rather explore them physically as it could become a very heavy and static piece, and it also allows for the characters' daydreams, and fantasies to come alive.  We were often inspired by our own family lives, and you can see quirky family moments come to life in this piece. We have also experienced being the family members of people with Alzheimer's, and from this, gathered that the very early stages and when a sufferer realises what they are going through, they are the main victim. However, it gets to a point when they no longer realise what is happening and they are living in their own world where they are happy, and yet the family look on with upset and have to watch their loved one go through this. In some cases, members of family become their carer, almost becoming the victim.  We are looking for sponsorship to help promote and put this performance on. We want to share our story of a family with Alzheimer’s to acknowledging the hardship of primarily the carers, as they can often be forgotten. It is a piece that will make you shed tears of laughter and sadness, and tells the story of a family who are going through what so many people are today.  Risks and challenges With a project that is based on a sensitive subject matter, we want to make sure that our piece is done in an appropriate manner and portrays the family conflicts in a way that our audience can relate to. We hope to gain a widespread audience of all backgrounds so that we can get people talking about this disease, which touches so many people's lives. To gain the diverse audience that we desire, we aim to advertise our piece through many forms, such as facebook, twitter and flyering around London. Through doing this we hope to reach an audience of all ages and backgrounds. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

    "textDescription": "Story \n\n\nNote that all pieces, except Stalac-Packs are DOUBLE-SIDED! \n \n\n \nThis is my first set of TerraScapes.  I present to you a natural Caves & Grottos core set. With the full range of double sided modular tiles, you can quickly create ultra-realistic cavern scenarios for any of your spelunking adventures! If you've ever found yourself in a cave, you know how under represented they are in the games that we love to play. There is nothing linear about spelunking and caverns aren't flat! Caves are twisted sections of open air encased by cool moist rocky walls.  That's why I've coined this terrain as a Nonlinear Modular Terrain System, and it's a new way of dressing your Tabletop with functional, dynamic terrain for all your Tabletop RPG's, War and Skirmish Games! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerraScapes: Caves and Grottos strives to simulate natural terrain for optimal immersion and strategic playability. To maximize the possibilities every tile is double sided! This means that with every tile you get twice the possible play space! Both tops and bottoms of each tile can be used in your layouts!  Each tile is designed to work like a table where instead of legs, you have stalactites and large rocks. It allows you to stack them up however you want! This gives your layout real depth and introduces a whole new dimension for increased strategical encounters. Whether it's for your big boss battle, wargame or random encounter, everything you'll need for an endless tactical cavern layout comes with our set of Caves & Grottos! This video shows how to build an endless array of immersive caverns for your tabletop! \n\n\nTerraScapes are produced in Port Clinton, OH, by the really awesome Effin Cool Minis casting house.  They are cast in Durable Dorkenite Resin.  Don't believe in Dorkenite? I've got proof.  Here is a video of me beating them against my hardwood gaming table. \n\n\nWhat's in the Full Set?  I have a ton of tiles prototyped and ready for this campaign.  If everything is unlocked we will have 9 Core double-sided tiles, 3 exclusive large  double-sided KS tiles, 2 Rock Packs which include a total of 8 double-sided rocks and rock/well combinations, 2 sets of Stalactite risers containing a total of 4 risers, 3 double-sided flowstone/pit centerpieces and 4 packs of double-sided wall sections containing 8 wall sections.  This is everything you'll need to bring to life any dynamic cavern scenario that you could possibly dream up!  You can purchase any of these Packs of tiles or accessories as Add-ons as they are unlocked during this campaign by managing your pledge amount and adding their cost(s).  If you are bad with arithmetic, just send me a message and I'll give you hand personally! I know, I know...  I'm getting ahead of myself here!  When the campaign launches we'll only have the three tiles from Core Pack:A, and the exclusive KS:1 tiles available.  Whenever we unlock another Core Pack, I will also unlock another exclusive KS tile for you to snatch up!  I am fairly confident that we are going to smash through almost every stretch goal I have planned. \n\n\nCore Pack:A Random Layout with KS Tile:1 \n \n\n \n\n\n With the exception of the Stalac-Packs, note that every terrain piece in TerraScapes is double-sided. The following graphics depict both the tops and bottoms of every piece and are not separate pieces offered with the packs.  The sizes listed are in terms of tile height.  So a Size 2 piece is two tiles high.  A Size 3 piece is 3 tiles high.   Please Manage your Pledge if you would like to add-on any pieces.  A survey will be sent after the Kickstarter has concluded for you to list which add-ons and options (like paint schemes) you would like.  All shipping charges will be handled by a Third Party Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter as well.  You will have until December 1st, 2017 to update your Pledge using this Pledge Manager \n\n\n3 Core Pack:A tiles and the first Exclusive KS Tile:1 \n \n\n \n\n\nAs each set of new tiles and accessories are unlocked we will journey deeper into what TerraScapes: Caves and Grottos has to offer any story.  During this campaign, your very pledges will move a group of adventurers through the deep, exploring the sets that you unlock.  Our heroes fate will depend upon your support!  When the campaign ends, our adventurers will either perish or succeed in escaping these deep Caves & Grottos!  \n\n\nCore Pack:A, KS Tile:1 and Rocks & Wells Pack:A \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRock & Wells Pack:A contains four Size 1 Risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStalac-Pack:A contains two Size 2 Risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCore Pack:B Random Layout with KS Tile:2 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3 Core Pack:B tiles and the second Exclusive KS Tile:2 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCore Pack:B, KS Tile:2, Stalac-Pack:A and Rocks & Wells Pack:A \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRock & Wells Pack:B contains four Size 1 Risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStalac-Packs A & B with Core Pack:B \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStalac-Pack:B contains two Size 3 Risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCore Pack:C Random Layout with KS Tile:3 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3 Core Pack:C tiles and the third Exclusive KS Tile:3 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCave Wall Pack:A, KS Tile:3 and Core Pack:C \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nCave Wall Pack:A contains two Size 2 Risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOne Flowstone & Pitfall Centerpiece:1 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFlowstone & Pits:1, Cave Walls Pack:A and B, and KS Tiles:1, 2 and 3 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCave Wall Pack:B contains two Size 2 Risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFlowstone & Pits:1 and 2, Cave Walls Pack:A and B, Rocks & Wells Pack:A and Core Pack:C \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOne Flowstone & Pitfall Centerpiece:2 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCave Walls Packs A, B and C with supports \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCave Walls Pack:C contains two size 3 wall risers \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOne Flowstone & Pitfall Centerpiece:3 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFlowstone & Pits:1,2 and 3, Cave Walls Pack:A and B, Rocks & Wells Pack:B and KS Tiles:1, 2 and 3 \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCave Walls Pack:D contains two size 3 wall risers. \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCaves & Grottos - Complete Set - Unlocked! \n \n\n \n\n\nWe have crushed all my planned terrain Stretch Goals!  Dreams do come true!  I cannot thank you all enough!  I feel very happy with the level of content in Caves & Grottos.  For the remaining Stretch Goals I'd like to focus on decorating and modifying your Caves, rather than building them up.

Unlocked! This reward is unlocked at 250 shares \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Setup: These tiles are not like their linear cousins. Placing down just 1 tile covers the same area as 4 to 8 terrain pieces from other 3d terrain makers. You can create an awesome, natural looking layout in under a minute! You can literally throw them down and get right back to the game. There is a near infinite amount of possibilities.  \nModular Variety: Any part of any side of any tile can be placed next to or on top of any other tile. Be creative! They are also double sided! I guess that gives them twice the infinite variety then! HA!  \nRealism: No other 3D terrain can match TerraScapes ability to create the most realistic looking Caves & Grottos. If you have ever ventured outside, you know that the natural world is not linear. This is the beauty inherent in a nonlinear terrain system! It's non uniform but structured design simulates a natural cave effortlessly. I can honestly say, even I didn't think they were going to work as well as they do. I'm floored every time I design another completely different layout than the one before.  \nScale Compatibility: The tile designs have been optimized for 15mm, 25mm, 28mm and even 32mm miniatures!  \nTerrain Compatibility: Already own a fine cavern set or terrain set? Great! These tiles will enhance ANY other terrain set whether 2D or 3D that you may have already invested in! There is no guarantee that TerraScapes will be compatible with any 4D or higher dimensional terrain.  \nGame Compatibility: Whether fantasy, sci-fi, western or modern, you may find yourself spelunking and adventuring your way through the deep!  \n For Enthusiasts AND Hobbyists: We are offering 2 finished options for your set of TerraScapes only during the Kickstarter! The unpainted set is fresh from the mould to your hobby desk. They are ready for prep, primer and paint and of course any other accoutrements. The painted set comes prepped, primed, professionally painted and sealed by TerraScape's own design studio, MGStudio! i.e. My monkeys and Me!  \nDurability: Made with 100% Dorkenite (a.k.a very sturdy and hard resin). I have thoroughly tested the material by throwing my first prototype into my hardwood table in a fit of nerd rage! Not a stalagmite was injured during this test!  \n 100% American Made! This wonderful product is being produced by gamers just like you. It gives us great pleasure to contribute to your games and enhance the stories being told around your tabletop! I am both proud and honored to announce that Effin Cool Minis will be producing TerraScapes. I am also happy to announce that their studio is less than a 2 hour drive from mine! Moving from production to fulfillment won't involve any overseas partners, boats, shipping containers, or customs. \n \nScale Modelling made easy! The caverns that you'll discover with Caves & Grottos practically build themselves. Some of the most interesting caverns I've seen made with TerraScapes were constructed by my 10 year old son. \nDayOne on KickTraq, check us out!!! \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Domestic and International shipping rates apply! I will be using a 3rd party Pledge Manager to account for all shipping charges! Here is a rough estimate for what to expect when shipping up to 3-5 Packs/Add-ons.  I will do my best to find better international rates, but to really make a dent in them, I will need an outpour of international support to warrant shipping by boat to select countries.  At this time I can not guarantee any better rates until I can gauge the international support!  Furthermore, I will require that all International Shipping be insured.   USA $8-$17, Australia $68, Brazil $61, Canada\t$53, China\t$69, Japan\t$64, Mexico\t$55, Russia\t$68, UK\t$69, EU\t$58 In accordance4 with the State of Ohio, I will be collecting 7.25% from any Ohio resident Backer via the Third Pledge Manager. Risks and challenges While projects like this can and I assume will attract the very naughtiest of Gremlins, I am quite confident that each issue can be dealt with accordingly. This project will not have to wait on overseas partners, shipping containers and customs, or any other major logistics issues as it is 100% American made. The casting studio, Effin Cool Miniatures is less than a 2 hour drive from my studio. This will ease the transition from production to fulfillment. My studio will also be professionally painting all these lovely tiles! I will be mobilizing a small contingent of painting monkeys to see each tile is painted to my studio's high standards. Furthermore, any unlocked tiles or packs that have yet to be finished will be finished, as I am the one who sculpts them. I do not have to wait or rely on commission work to see this project through to fulfillment and beyond!\n\nFinally, this is my first Kickstarter Campaign and Project to be funded. This may be the biggest hurdle to overcome. However I can tell you that I am very much excited to see my studio's first big distribution on your tabletop! It is more than enough motivation to get the job done. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ Report this project to Kickstarter "
